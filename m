What's wrong with the proposed max_segment_count? Many media devices do have a
limited max_segment_count and that should be taken into account.

Although to be fair I have to say that in practice the limited segment counts
are all well above what is needed for a normal capture buffer, but it might
be reached if you have video strides > line width, so each line has its own segment
(or two, if there is a page boundary in the middle of the line). It's a somewhat
contrived use-case, though, although I have done this once myself.

Anyway, the worst-case number of segments would be:

height * ((bytesperline + PAGE_SIZE - 1) / PAGE_SIZE)

That might well exceed the max segment count for some devices.

I think I have also seen devices in the past that have a coarse-grained IOMMU that
uses very large segment sizes, but have a very limited segment count. We don't
have media drivers like that, and to be honest I am not sure whether we should
bother too much with this corner case.

+1

One of the main problems end-users are faced with today is that they do not
know which device should be the exporter of buffers and which should be the
importer. This depends on the constraints and right now applications have
no way of knowing this. It's nuts that this hasn't been addressed yet since
it is the main complaint I am getting.

And it is something that the V4L2 API needs to export to userland anyway for
both the above and some other V4L2-specific reasons.

BTW, one thing I didn't see in the constraints discussion (but I didn't read
everything, so I may very well have missed it), is reporting whether memory
is opaque (i.e. cannot be mapped by non-trusted devices). No, I don't have
such hardware, but I know it exists. All the constraints mentioned so far
apply to such memory as well, but this is an additional flag (or perhaps some
trust ID). I don't think anyone made drivers for such hardware, although I
recently saw someone working on something like that.

Does anyone know about someone working in this area? Or existing code for this?

All I am saying is that this is sure to appear at some point.

Regards,

	Hans
