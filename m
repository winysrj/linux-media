My first instinct is 'I wonder which drivers will call map_attachment at
the wrong time and screw things up'. Are there any plans for
synchronization and/or debugging output to catch drivers violating this
requirement?

The .phys operation makes it difficult to have drivers which can
handle both contiguous and non contiguous memory (too much special
casing). Any chance we could drop this API and just have drivers
treat an sg_table with 1 entry as contiguous memory?
