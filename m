And how does that work? Atm there's no interfaces at all in the kernel to
allocate a buffer suitable for 2 devices at the same time. Seems
incomplete if this is the direction you want to go to. Also, it's against
the direction we all discussed ad XDC, where the clear consensus was to
have most of that haggling in userspace (with the kernel exporting a
little bit more information to userspace than what it does now).
