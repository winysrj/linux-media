The -rc cycle is for fixes only so this cannot get merged into v3.7
as-is. If the patch has some fixes embedded, its a good idea to separate
them out (and have the feature parts come after the fixes in the patch
series) so they can be considered for -rc cycle. The current description
does not detail what the issue is and what its impact is so when you do
separate it out, please mention those as well. It will help determine
the severity of the issue and convince maintainers to include it in v3.7.

Thanks,
Sekhar
