Thanks for posting your patch.  How about people get some discussion
going about the pros/cons instead of ignoring it?  The best method for
the most devices needs to be the deciding factor here, not
accepting/disregarding based on who "your" friends are.  For once it
would be nice if the childish politics could get throw out and what's
best for v4l be the highest priority.

And a thanks to anyone else that would like to submit a recommendation
on how to deal with this.  Hopefully there will be a few "solid"
proposals to consider.

Regards.
