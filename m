No, but the A31 IR receiver has some additional bits in the FIFO control
and status registers, as well as the config register (which controls
sampling parameters). Looks like the A31 has an improved version. That
would make it backward compatible, if not for the fact that the FIFO
level bits are at a different offset, which might have been moved to
make way for the extra bits. That would make them incompatible. But
this should really be tested.

So the fallback compatible should be the A31's, not the A13's.

The A64's looks like the same hardware as the A31, with two extra bits:

  - CGPO: register 0x00, bit offset 8. Controls output level of
          "non-existing" TX pin

  - DRQ_EN: register 0x2c, bit offset 5. Controls DRQ usage for DMA.
            Not really useful as there isn't a DMA request line for
            the hardware.

Both bits are also togglable on the A31, but since actual hardware
don't support these two features, I think we can ignore them.

So it looks like for the A64 has the same IP block as the A31, in
which case we won't need the per-SoC compatible as we've done the
work to compare them.

Maxime, what do you think? And do you guys have any A10s/A13 hardware
to test the FIFO level bits?
