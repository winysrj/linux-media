Hi,

Sorry for not getting into it earlier... too much work those days.

The RC_BIT_UNKNOWN has 3 usages:
	1) when the protocol is unknown;
	2) on legacy tables, when the full scancode is unknown;
	3) on broken devices where just the command part of the scancode
	   (7 or 8 bits) is known.

In the case of em28xx, only (2) applies.

So, the behavior on em28xx is to support legacy IR tables written using
the legacy input layer, that use to support only 8 bits for keycodes.
So, we don't know the address bits of the keycodes. 

The expected behavior on em28xx when RC_BIT_UNKNOWN is used, is that
the keycode tables would be 8-bits masked, and the same mask should
also be applied to the received keycodes. This is done by the RC core.

That is used only by a very few set of em28xx cards:

$ for i in $(git grep RC_MAP_ $(git grep -l  _UNKNOWN drivers/media/rc/keymaps/)|perl -ne 'print "$1\n" if (m/(RC_MAP_[\w\d\_]+)/)');do git grep $i drivers/media/usb/em28xx/; done
drivers/media/usb/em28xx/em28xx-cards.c:          .ir_codes       = RC_MAP_ATI_TV_WONDER_HD_600,
drivers/media/usb/em28xx/em28xx-input.c:                  rc->map_name = RC_MAP_EM_TERRATEC;
drivers/media/usb/em28xx/em28xx-cards.c:          .ir_codes     = RC_MAP_EVGA_INDTUBE,
drivers/media/usb/em28xx/em28xx-cards.c:          .ir_codes     = RC_MAP_GADMEI_RM008Z,
drivers/media/usb/em28xx/em28xx-cards.c:          .ir_codes     = RC_MAP_KAIOMY,
drivers/media/usb/em28xx/em28xx-input.c:                  rc->map_name = RC_MAP_PINNACLE_GREY;
drivers/media/usb/em28xx/em28xx-cards.c:          .ir_codes       = RC_MAP_TERRATEC_CINERGY_XS,
drivers/media/usb/em28xx/em28xx-cards.c:          .ir_codes     = RC_MAP_TERRATEC_CINERGY_XS,
drivers/media/usb/em28xx/em28xx-input.c:                  rc->map_name = RC_MAP_WINFAST_USBII_DELUXE;
drivers/media/usb/em28xx/em28xx-input.c:                  rc->map_name = RC_MAP_WINFAST_USBII_DELUXE;

Patches are welcome to replace the above scancode tables by one with
the full code, as we want to use RC_BIT_UNKNOWN only on broken hardware
where the scancode is only partially filled.

Btw, the bits that handles the masks are at rc-main.c, at
ir_establish_scancode():

	if (dev->scanmask)
		scancode &= dev->scanmask;

A quick look at em28xx shows that it is not using it anymore, so some
patch likely broke support for RC_BIT_UNKNOWN there.

So, a fix is needed there to fill dev->scanmask if a RC_BIT_UNKNOWN
table is used.

It should be noticed that tables with RC_BIT_UNKNOWN are generally 
not portable among devices, as some of those tables have the command
bits inverted.

For legacy tables, only 16 bits are needed (as all those tables are
for either RC5 or NEC), in the form of <addr><cmd> and dev->scanmask
should be 0xff.

The rationale to not mask the scancode to contain just the <cmd> part
is that the produced debug messages could be used by someone to
identify the address for those broken IR keytables and write a patch
for us fixing it.

Mauro
