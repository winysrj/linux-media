Hi, is there anyone that has started to work on Realtek RTD 1261
(http://rtd1261.wikidot.com/internals), 1283 etc type systems?

Here is the kernel of RTD 1283
http://gator884.hostgator.com/~xtreamer/Xtreamer_GPL/xtr_kernel.tar.bz2

I would like to know if what they gave is enough to use
encoder/decoder/osd capabilities. Or would this be the wrong mailing
list to ask, if so please direct me to where I should ask.

Thanks,
Theunis
