Ah indeed, I rather glossed through the callers and noticed that at least some
held locks long enough or were called with a lock held sufficient that I wasn't
sure it could be released.

Very nice!

My (somewhat minor) concern was that there would be confusion due to the
existence of the triumvirate of g_u_p()/g_u_p_unlocked()/g_u_p_locked(), however
the comments do a decent enough job of explaining the situation.

I meant only in the case where we'd remove get_user_pages() and instead be left
with get_user_pages_[un]locked() only, meaning we'd have to add some means of
retrieving vmas if locked was set NULL, of course in cases where locked is not
NULL it makes no sense to add it.

Yeah I think this is sane as it is actually, this patch set was a lot less
convincing of a cleanup than prior ones and overall it seems we are better off
with the existing API.

I wonder whether a better patch series to come out of this would be to find
cases where the lock could be dropped (i.e. the ones you mention above) and to
switch to using get_user_pages_[un]locked() where it makes sense to.

I am happy to look into these cases (though of course I must leave your
suggested patch here to you :)
