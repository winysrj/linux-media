Thanks Ohad, for the comments, We do have an internal TODO.
In terms of functionality we have stuff like TX RDS which already has
few CIDs in the extended controls.
extend V4L2 for complete-scan, add in stop search during hw_seek .. etc...
But I just wanted to ask whether this is good enough to be staged.
Because as we begin to implement and add in the items in TODO - the
patch set will keep continuing to grow.

So Hans, Mauro, What do you think ?
It would be real helpful - if this can be staged, it is becoming
difficult to maintain for us.

Thanks,
Pavan
