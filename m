That is not fully true yet either and Barry is correct for Frankfurt
Rhein/Main and others.

If you look at the patch Christoph has created now,

http://linuxtv.org/hg/dvb-apps/rev/98d3c06e5ef9

even Berlin has "Das Erste" and "RBB" on the same multiplex.

It seems we can say that there are separate muliplexes for
regional/third programs of other states/Bundeslaender, but the ARD "Das
Erste" multiplex often contains the "third program" of the
state/Bundesland where the transmitter is located.

I guess they else can't receive SWR anymore in that region.
