it wont work for any what I can tell.

We were forced into such an universal looking solution, but it was
broken only a short time later.

I for sure don't say that this time, late 2005, it was in anyway
perfect, too much random on module load orders and also duplicate
address stuff around meanwhile.

But, however, it seems to be blocked for a global attempt within the
current schemes too.

Cheers,
Hermann
