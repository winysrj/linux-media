I've posted in ubuntu forums
--->
http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?p=12115667#post12115667
and I've searched all over. It's odd there's just me with 
this problem.

That is why I am trying to actively seek help.
Until now I have only searched by 
myself.
I have tried several approaches but none has worked.

What seems surprising is that at the beginning (say the first half a minute)
the image and sound are fairly good. But as the time moves on (and the card 
heats up) image and sound get poorer.

I appreciate your gesture, Oliver.

Regards
