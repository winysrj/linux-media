Hi Laura,

Thank you for the patches.

That's where most of my concerns with ion are. I still strongly believe that 
the heap-based approach is inherently flawed, as it would need to be 
configured for each device according to product-specific use cases. That's not 
something that could be easily shipped with a generic distribution. We should 
replace that with a constraint-based system.
