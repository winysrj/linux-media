Well, the best would be to make alsa-driver backward compatible.
Basically we need to patch headers in alsa-kernel tree to be
binary-compatible with older versions, i.e. adjusting the fields
in struct snd_pcm or so, and supply the compatible function,
snd_card_new() in addition.

This could be done automatically in alsa-driver build process, but
I have little time to work on it...
