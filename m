Hi Mauro

Have you encountered a strange bug with Kaffeine with VLC backend.

Certain channels will not play correctly, the recordings will also not 
play in VLC.

However, they will play fine with xine player. Only some channels are 
affected of those provided by SKY such as 12207 V on Astra 28.2.

These channels will play fine with Kaffeine with xine backend they also 
play with VLC's dvb-s interface.

Any ideas what could be wrong with the TS format?

I am wondering if SKY are inserting something into the format.

Regards


Malcolm
