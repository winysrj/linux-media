I would like to confirm that it will work with MFC. Am I right that the
below will work? Did you take that into account?

So in MFC's case the V4L2_BUF_FLAG_LAST will be set on the one buffer after
the last one and the bytesused of that buffer would be set to 0. 

The problem of MFC is that it will signal that the last frame was decoded
after it was decoded. To particularize:
- a frame is decoded, an irq is sent by MFC - we have a new decoded picture
- next an irq is sent with an internal MFC flag that the buffer is empty
  (last picture was already decoded)
