Well, OMAP processors have experienced lock-ups due to multiple mappings of
memory, so the restriction in the architecture manual is for real.

But more the issue is that the behaviour you get from a region is _totally_
unpredictable (as the arch manual says).  With the VIPT caches, they can
be searched irrespective of whether the page tabkes indicate that it's
supposed to be cached or not - which means you can still hit cache lines
for an ioremap'd region.

And if you do, how do you know that the cached data is still valid - what
if it's some critical data that results in corruption - how do you know
whether that's happened or not?  It might not even cause a kernel
exception.

We have to adhere to the restrictions placed upon us by the architecture
at hand, and if that means device drivers break, so be it - at least we
get to know what needs to be fixed for these restrictions.
