Thanks for the response Mike!

You claim there is a Hauppauge HVR-1900... I am looking on the 
www.hauppauge.co.uk website and all I see is a 1400 which is SMC slot??

In fact just checked hauppauge.com and there seems to be a 1950 model! 
Perhaps it hasn't been released yet or maybe I haven't found it. Is it 
HD compatible like the HVR-900H model?
--This is not so important but a nicety none the less :-)

I will forward my previous post to you directly!

Regards,

Kaya
