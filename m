you should not be such rude.

You have never been in any hardware details on v4l and dvb.

After Gerd Knorr did quit, out of reasons, you noticed there is some
noise on v4l and dvb, but you never had to fix much on your own in the
last eight years.

Shouting around and blaming others always was enough ...

I agree, a rc-1 should be at least compile tested.

Any idea, why this goes away?

Cheers,
Hermann
