The function is called from alloc_contig_range() (see patch 05/12) which
makes sure that the PFN is valid.  Situation where there is not enough
space is caught earlier in alloc_contig_range().

alloc_contig_freed_pages() must be given a valid PFN range such that all
the pages in that range are free (as in are within the region tracked by
page allocator) and of MIGRATETYPE_ISOLATE so that page allocator won't
touch them.

That's why invalid PFN is a bug in the caller and not an exception that
has to be handled.

Also, the function is not called during boot time.  It is called while
system is already running.
