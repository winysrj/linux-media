Hi.  I've got a theoretical question I just wanted to
pass by you all.

Now, software capture cards collect raw information
from their video and audio composite jacks, right? 
Then the software processes these streams into a file.
 Would it be possible to connect component cables from
a high def. video source to the video and audio
composite plugs of the capture card, and have a
program process the three streams together as video
streams instead of video and audio streams, then save
the result in a file?  Audio can be captured
elsewhere, such as by an audio-in plug.

Or would the hardware on the capture card filter out
anything it would not perceive as audio?

I'm not taking into consideration processing power or
hard drive access bottlenecks, or other hardware
limitations beyond the capture card.

Thanks guys.
Sam.
