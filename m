We currently have more than 64 ioctl's. Adding a capability bit for each doesn't
seem the right thing to do. Ok, some could be grouped, but, even so, there are
drivers that implement the VIDIOC_G, but doesn't implement the corresponding VIDIO_S.
So, I think we don't have enough available bits for doing that.

Bogus in the sense that drivers don't follow them, as they're returning undocumented
values. Any application strictly following it will have troubles.

As I said, from userspace perspective, it is not consistent to assume that EINVAL means
not implemented. For sure at VIDIOC_S_foo, this is not consistent. Even on some GET types
of ioctl, like for example [1][2], there are other reasons for an EINVAL return.

[2] http://linuxtv.org/downloads/v4l-dvb-apis/vidioc-g-audio.html

The only way to make it consistent is to use different return codes for "invalid parameters" 
and for "unsupported ioctl".

The fix that it is needed is to provide a consistent way for an userspace application
to know for sure when an ioctl is not supported. It can be done on a simple way of
just returning a different error code for it, or with complex mechanisms like adding
a per-ioctl flag and some hint logics based on NOP.

The V4L2 is complex enough for us to add more complexity with hints and cap flags.
