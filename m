Not necessarily. The pipe is set to NULL if the count goes to zero.

This check should be dropped, it's ill-placed anyway: if streaming count is
zero the pipe is expected to be NULL anyway in which case you get a NULL
pointer exception (that you saw there). With the check removed, you should
get the warning instead.
