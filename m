Hi,
I finally received my LI-5M03 for the Beagleboard which includes mt9p031 sensor.

I know Guennadi has somewhere an outdated version of a driver for it.
I would like to help you out on updating the driver so that it can be
submitted to mainline.
Guennadi please, if you could point me out to that code I could start
the job myself.

Just one question: what GIT repository + branch should I choose to
work on, so that we can seamlessly integrate the changes later?

Thank you.
