Right this module gets built when CONFIG_MEDIA_SUPPORT is enabled
and stubs are in place when it is not enabled. The intent is for
this feature to be enabled by default when media support is enabled.
When a driver doesn't create the resource, it will simply not find it
and for drivers like snd-usb-audio that aren't tried to media support,
the stubs are in place and feature is essentially disabled.

I picked lib so this module can be included in non-media drivers
e.g: snd-usb-audio.

Does this help explain the design? I didn't want to introduce a new
config for this feature. If lib isn't right place, could you recommend
another one that makes this modules available to non-media drivers?
moving isn't a problem.
