Subject: [PATCH 0/6] get rid of on-stack dma buffers
Date: Mon, 21 Mar 2011 19:33:40 +0100

Hi all!

These patches get rid of on-stack dma buffers for some of the dvb-usb drivers. 
I do not own the hardware, so these are only compile tested. I would 
appreciate testing and review.
They were previously sent to the list, but some error on my side
prevented (some of?) them from beeing delivered to all parties (the lists).

These changes are motivated by 
https://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=15977 .

The patches which got tested already were submitted to Mauro (and
lkml/linux-media) yesterday seperately. Those fix this same issue for ec168,
ce6230, au6610 and lmedm04. 

A fix for vp702x has been submitted seperately for review on the list. I have
similiar fixes like the vp702x-fix for dib0700 (overlooked some on-stack
buffers in there in my original submission as well) and gp8psk, but I am
holding them back 'till I got time to recheck those and getting some feedback
on vp702x.

Please review and test.

Regards,
Flo
