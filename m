Hey,

I was wondering if this dish(1) would be working ok with a Hauppauge 
HVR-4000, I read about some users not being able to use the built-in 
Disecq switch, is that still true or can I safley invest in one?

The wiki doesn't say much about dishes an switches itzelf and as I 
understand this dish uses a disecg 1.0 switch.

Thanks in advance,

Jos Hoekstra
