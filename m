I've tried private browsing+flushing my cache+removing all cookies+starting the browser 'clean'.
I start by being 'not logged in'.
I open the devices-page, log in, click the icon to the right of the device, but still see the same page, as when you are not logged in.

Thanks for your guidance. Now I know what to do, when I'm allowed to do it. =)
