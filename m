dear all:
I saw there is a "Audio Devices Rev. 2.0 Spec and Adopters Agreement"
on the usb org.
But so far my device can bought are FS instead of HS.
Since I need HS audio device which list in "Audio Devices Rev. 2.0
Spec and Adopters Agreement" to verification the performance of my
host.
I try very hard to find some possible devices with linux support on the net.

per your experience, are below 2 meet "Audio Devices Rev. 2.0 Spec and
Adopters Agreement"?

WinTV-HVR-1950 high performance USB TV tuner
WinTV-HVR-950Q for laptop and notebooks

if they are not would you please tell me where and what device meet
the spec requirement and also supported by linux.
appreciate your help,
miloody
