That would be good.  Although I expect that the allocation would need
to be 100% rock-solid reliable, otherwise the end user has a
non-functioning device.  Could generic core VM provide the required level
of service?

Anyway, these patches are going to be hard to merge but not impossible.
Keep going.  Part of the problem is cultural, really: the consumers of
this interface are weird dinky little devices which the core MM guys
tend not to work with a lot, and it adds code which they wouldn't use.

I agree that having two "contiguous memory allocators" floating about
on the list is distressing.  Are we really all 100% diligently certain
that there is no commonality here with Zach's work?

I agree that Peter's above suggestion would be the best thing to do. 
Please let's take a look at that without getting into sunk cost
fallacies with existing code!

It would help (a lot) if we could get more attention and buyin and
fedback from the potential clients of this code.  rmk's feedback is
valuable.  Have we heard from the linux-media people?  What other
subsystems might use it?  ieee1394 perhaps?  Please help identify
specific subsystems and I can perhaps help to wake people up.

And I agree that this code (or one of its alternatives!) would benefit
from having a core MM person take a close interest.  Any volunteers?

Please cc me on future emails on this topic?
