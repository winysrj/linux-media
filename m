I'm not sold on this prefix, since wound-wait is just the
implementation detail of how it detects/handles deadlocks. For users a
really dumb strategy of just doing a mutex trylock and always
returning -EAGAIN if that fails (together with a msleep(rand) in the
slowpath) would have the same interface. Almost at least, we could
ditch the ticket - but the ticket is used as a virtual lock for the
lockdep annotation, so ditching it would also reduce lockdep
usefulness (due to all those trylocks). So in case we ever switch the
deadlock/backoff algo ww_ would be a bit misleading.

Otoh reservation_ is just what it's used for in graphics-land, so not
that much better. I don't really have a good idea for what this is
besides mutexes_with_magic_deadlock_detection_and_backoff. Which is a
bit long.
