This driver going to staging is not going to replace anything as such.

The reason to put the driver to staging is simply that it'd be part of the
kernel source so people can use it effortlessly, just as any other driver
that's in staging. If you compare this to them, I think you will find it for
this driver's favour. Reading the Barcelona mini-summit report, isn't the
only requirement for staging drivers that they compile? I think this driver
passes that requiremnt with flying colours.

The driver that's currently in drivers/media/platform/davinci is a) serves a
small subset of potential use cases and b) lacks most features the hardware
can offer. This new driver that's intended for staging, is more generic,
feature-rich and supports standard APIs such as V4L2 subdev and Media
controller which the old driver does not do at all.

The TODO file exists to document what needs to be done to this driver to get
it out of staging. After this is done, its APIs and functionality is similar
to that offered by the OMAP 3 ISP driver.

What's currently is in mainline more closely resembles what the OMAP 3 ISP
driver used to be in the end of 2008. The code quality is better and it
contains less hacks, but still that is the case. At the time me and Laurent
decided that we didn't want to push it to staging, but instead continue
developing it out-of-tree.

We know this is bad, and it's not going to stay. Improving the user space
API is mentioned in the TODO file. Also, much of this configuration is for
parts that weren't supported by the old driver to begin with.

If you're looking to see API compatibility between the two, you will not be
able to get it: the old driver simply implements a different profile (which
should be defined but that's a separate issue). This is a new driver and
deserves to be treated that way.

If someone depends on the old driver currently, we should keep that old
driver in the tree and eventually remove it once users have moved to use the
new one. That requires resolving the issues listed in the TODO file and
accepting the driver as part of the media tree.
