It depends. Imagine your frame grabber has built-in RAM buffer on board
just as the frame buffer RAM on graphics cards, defined in BAR. You can use
dma_declare_coherent_memory()/dma_release_declared_memory() in
your driver and then use dma_alloc_coherent()/dma_free_coherent()
to allocate dma buffers from it and falling back transparently to system RAM
when this local resource is exhausted.

Yes, just to preallocate not coherent, but rather contiguous memory for latter usage.
We use coherent memory because it turns out to be contiguous.

I do not know why dma_pool API doesn't work for frame grabber buffers.
May be they are too big ~400KB. I have tried dma_pool APIs without success 
some time ago, so I had to find some other way to solve my problem leading to 
the proposed dma_reserve_coherent_memory()/dma_free_reserved_memory().

Thanks.
