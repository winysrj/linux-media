Dear Antti, Mauro & others,

We don't want to flood the mailing lists with dirts.
It is regretful to send this kind of email, however
as we just received a "war declaration" from Tsukada Akihiro,
it is better to postpone delivering PT3 driver to the main kernel tree.

A series proof of facts follow.

Thanks again for your appreciation.
Bud @ AreMa Inc.
