Hi everybody!

I would like to ask for analog cable support in the HVR-950q driver
since there appears to be no plans for broadcasting OTA ATSC here in
Edmonton/Canada for a while and I already have an analog cable
subscription...

Are there any plans to include analog support, or if so, any rough idea
when this might be the case? I only have another 3 days to return the
USB Device and need to know whether there is any realistic chance it
will happen eventually.

Thanks for all your great work from a non-programmer linux tv newb!

Regards,
Goetz
