Will do.

Great :)

Good point.  I can add a quirk such that it only happens with the C920.

It's a bit of a strange behaviour.  I'd already tried littering the code
with (uncached) GET_CUR requests.  It seems that the value changes
sometime during the call to usb_set_interface in uvc_init_video. 
Strangely enough though calling uvc_ctrl_restore_values immediately
after uvc_init_video has no effect.  It must be put after the
usb_submit_urb loop to fix the problem.

Wireshark tells me that it is sending a control update event, but it
seems like uvcvideo ignores it.  I had to add the flag
UVC_CTRL_FLAG_AUTO_UPDATE to the uvc_control_info entry for "Exposure
(Auto)" for the new value to be properly reported to userspace.

Thanks
