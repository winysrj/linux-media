Andreas was excited by your imaginations and calculations, but not me.
Now you again manifested you are not treating me as partner for discussion.
Otherwise you should try to understand how-that-ugly-hack works.
But you surelly didn't try to do it at all.

How do you find those 45 ioctls for DVB-C tune? I still see only one ioctl
FE_SET_FRONTEND or v5+ variant FE_SET_PROPERTY.

Sorry, but, for example, szap tunes very close to local variant:

# time szap -c channels.conf -x Ocko
reading channels from file 'channels.conf'
zapping to 15 'ocko':
sat 0, frequency = 12168 MHz V, symbolrate 27500000, vpid = 0x00a0,
apid = 0x0050 sid = 0x1451
using '/dev/dvb/adapter0/frontend0' and '/dev/dvb/adapter0/demux0'
