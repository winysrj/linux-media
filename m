Yes, on newer standards. However, the API spec still mentions Viterbi as
one or the frontend possible status.

Anyway, I agree: it is better to use the generic term. However, as calling it
as pre-Viterbi BER is common, I opted to keep the Viterbi nomenclature in
parenthesis.

While here, I'll also fix the status documentation at the DVB API:

 <entry align="char">FE_HAS_VITERBI</entry>
-<entry align="char">The frontend FEC code is stable</entry>
+<entry align="char">The frontend FEC inner coding (Viterbi, LDPC or other inner code) is stable</entry>

Ok, I'll add both then. I have already coded the pre-BER code for mb86a20s.
I'll later code a post-BER logic there at the driver.

I think it is not incorrect to say bits count, but the better is to use
singular on all measures.

Ok, This is how those measures are now shown after the fixes:

DTV_STAT_PRE_BIT_ERROR_COUNT
============================

Measures the number of bit errors before the forward error correction (FEC) on the inner coding block (before Viterbi, LDPC or other inner code).

This measure is taken during the same interval as DTV_STAT_PRE_TOTAL_BIT_COUNT.

In order to get the BER (Bit Error Rate) measurement, it should be divided by DTV_STAT_PRE_TOTAL_BIT_COUNT.

This measurement is monotonically increased, as the frontend gets more bit count measurements. The frontend may reset it when a channel/transponder is tuned.

Possible scales for this metric are:

    FE_SCALE_NOT_AVAILABLE - it failed to measure it, or the measurement was not complete yet.
    FE_SCALE_COUNTER - Number of error bits counted before the inner coding.

DTV_STAT_PRE_TOTAL_BIT_COUNT
============================

Measures the amount of bits received before the inner code block, during the same period as DTV_STAT_PRE_BIT_ERROR_COUNT measurement was taken.

It should be noticed that this measurement can be smaller than the total amount of bits on the transport stream, as the frontend may need to manually restart the measurement, loosing some data between each measurement interval.

This measurement is monotonically increased, as the frontend gets more bit count measurements. The frontend may reset it when a channel/transponder is tuned.

Possible scales for this metric are:

    FE_SCALE_NOT_AVAILABLE - it failed to measure it, or the measurement was not complete yet.
    FE_SCALE_COUNTER - Number of bits counted while measuring DTV_STAT_PRE_BIT_ERROR_COUNT.

DTV_STAT_POST_BIT_ERROR_COUNT
=============================

Measures the number of bit errors after the forward error correction (FEC) done by inner code block (after Viterbi, LDPC or other inner code).

This measure is taken during the same interval as DTV_STAT_POST_TOTAL_BIT_COUNT.

In order to get the BER (Bit Error Rate) measurement, it should be divided by DTV_STAT_POST_TOTAL_BIT_COUNT.

This measurement is monotonically increased, as the frontend gets more bit count measurements. The frontend may reset it when a channel/transponder is tuned.

Possible scales for this metric are:

    FE_SCALE_NOT_AVAILABLE - it failed to measure it, or the measurement was not complete yet.
    FE_SCALE_COUNTER - Number of error bits counted after the inner coding.

DTV_STAT_POST_BIT_ERROR_COUNT
=============================

Measures the number of bit errors after the forward error correction (FEC) done by inner code block (after Viterbi, LDPC or other inner code).

This measure is taken during the same interval as DTV_STAT_POST_TOTAL_BIT_COUNT.

In order to get the BER (Bit Error Rate) measurement, it should be divided by DTV_STAT_POST_TOTAL_BIT_COUNT.

This measurement is monotonically increased, as the frontend gets more bit count measurements. The frontend may reset it when a channel/transponder is tuned.

Possible scales for this metric are:

    FE_SCALE_NOT_AVAILABLE - it failed to measure it, or the measurement was not complete yet.
    FE_SCALE_COUNTER - Number of error bits counted after the inner coding

IMO, it is better to be more technical, to avoid implementation mistakes.

Changed it to:

DTV_STAT_ERROR_BLOCK_COUNT
==========================

Measures the number of block errors after the outer forward error correction coding (after Reed-Solomon or other outer code).

This measurement is monotonically increased, as the frontend gets more bit count measurements. The frontend may reset it when a channel/transponder is tuned.

Possible scales for this metric are:

    FE_SCALE_NOT_AVAILABLE - it failed to measure it, or the measurement was not complete yet.
    FE_SCALE_COUNTER - Number of error blocks counted after the outer coding.

Yes, I know. My brain trapped me on that ;)

I think both terms are almost synonymous. Packet reminds more like an
IP-based variable-length sequence, where block sounds more like a 
fixed-length.

As those measures can be used either for UCB (blocks) or PER (packet),
both terms sound correct, IMHO.

I would keep block, as UCB is a more common measurement than PER.

Ok, thanks for your review!

I'll soon post patches 1 and 2 after those changes. The remaining 4 patches
don't likely need any change.
