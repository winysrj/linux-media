Hi, how are you? My name is J Eric Denials, External Financial Auditor at Lloyds Banking Group plc., London. It is a pleasure to contact you at this time through this medium. I have a cool and legitimate deal to do with you as you're a foreigner, it will be mutually beneficial to both. If youâ€™re interested, urgently, get back to me for more explanation about the deal.
Regards
Eric
