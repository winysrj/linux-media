I have had no responses to my request above for information about support 
for this DVB-T2 USB stick, posted a fortnight ago.  I know the developers 
are busy people but I really would appreciate some feedback here! I am 
very willing to help the developers with testing etc. or even try editing 
the driver code again myself but I really can't know where to start 
without knowing what the drivers are supposed to support/not support on 
this device.

CCing Antti Palosaari <crope@iki.fi>, who developed the driver for 
the MN88473 demodulator.

Many thanks
Tom Crane
