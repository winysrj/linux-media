Exactly.

I can reproduce it on my host *alone* as I said in the very first message - never
before I tried to run my Linux in a virtual machine. Please, just forget about
VirtualBox - it has nothing to do with this problem.

Yes, like I said earlier - only when I try to access its settings using Adobe Flash the
system crashes/freezes.

I don't think many people have the same webcam so it's going to be a problem. It
can be reproduced easily - just open Flash "Settings" in Google Chrome 22. The
crash will occur immediately.

The freeze happens on my *host* Linux PC. For an experiment I decided to
check if I could reproduce the freeze under a virtual machine - it turns out the
Linux kernel running under it also freezes.
