Ok, it seems I'm misunderstanding the meaning of color "gain" and
"balance"...

Anyway, I would say that it makes sense to have per color AND global
controls, so a V4L2_CID_GREEN_BALANCE would be missing.
Weather it makes sense to use them at the same time is a different question.

And why do you think the controls in question are gain controls instead
of balance controls ?
The Windows driver calls them balance controls, too (which could of
course also be a Windows driver or API issue...).

No, we shouldn't do that.
Reg 0xc6 (currently called "white balance temperature") definitely works
different compared to register 0x02.
Whatever it does exactly, it's not green gain or balance adjustment.
Will try to figure out next time.
The Windows driver doesn't use this register for an (user settable)
image control. It just sets its value to 55, which I fixed with one of
the patches from my previous patch series, so we have the correct
default value now.
0xc6 is also different from regs 0xc5 and 0xc7: settable values are
0-255 compared to 0-3.

So let's not touch 0xc6 / "white balance" until we know its real meaning
and just apply the first 2 patches.

Frank
