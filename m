I'm working on this on and off, whenever I find (or get allotted) time.
Mainly the media entity abstraction has to be reworked to only include
the IPU blocks that have actual direct hardware connections (CSI0/1,
VDIC, IC). And since the two IPUs share the same media device graph,
the media controller setup has to use the managed media controller API.

best regards
Philipp
