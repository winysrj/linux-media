A backport is possible, even though not trivial. Also, due to resources 
there is no guaranty of a new stable 1.2 release. For GStreamer 0.10, it 
is no longer maintained since 2 years already (mentioning since Laurent 
was using an old vendor specific version base on this). Though this 
situation isn't different from using a vendor specific kernel.

This seems an unlikely mix, as Gst 1.4 was released at around the same 
moment as libv4l2 1.2.
