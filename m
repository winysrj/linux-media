Is there someone willing to assist me in finding out why
my video configuration will not work?

I am using a Sony HDR-SR11 as a webcam.  Camorama does show
video.  Other video tools recognize it.  Skype does not
recognize it.

Yahoo messenger shows video once I changed the video preference
to Composite.

The driver I am using is stk1160 on Ubuntu 12.04

In WebRTC (https://appear.in),  stk1160 does show in the Firefox drop
down menu for
camera and microphone, but after I select it, it says it cannot
connect.

I'd appreciate a helping hand.  Just beware I know little to nothing
about how a web video is created and sent and what is needed to do
that.

Thanks and I appreciate your help.

Ray
