Subject: [PATCH RFC] media: rc: OF: Add Generic bindings for remote-control
Date: Fri, 27 Sep 2013 10:33:11 +0100
Message-Id: <1380274391-26577-1-git-send-email-srinivas.kandagatla@st.com>
Sender: linux-media-owner@vger.kernel.org
List-ID: <linux-media.vger.kernel.org>

From: Srinivas Kandagatla <srinivas.kandagatla@st.com>

This patch attempts to collate generic bindings which can be used by
the remote control hardwares. Currently the list is not long as there
are only 2 drivers which are device tree'd.

Mainly this patch tries to document few bindings used by ST IRB driver
which can be generic as well. This document also add fews common
bindings used by most of the drivers like, interrupts, regs, clocks and
pinctrls.

This document can also be holding place to describe generic bindings
used in remote controls devices.

Hi All, 
Following Stephen Warren's suggestions at https://lkml.org/lkml/2013/9/24/452
this patch is an attempt to document such generic bindings in a common
document.

This document currently collates all the generic bindings used with
remote-controls and act as holding place to describe generic bindings for
remote controls.

Comments?

Thanks,
srini

+Generic device tree bindings for remote control.
+
+properties:
+	- compatible: Can contain any remote control driver compatible string.
+	  example: "st-comms-irb, "gpio-ir-receiver".
+	- reg: Base physical address of the controller and length of memory
+	  mapped region.
+	- interrupts: Interrupt-specifier for the sole interrupt generated by
+	  the device. The interrupt specifier format depends on the
+	  interrupt controller parent. Iff the device supports interrupts.
+	- rx-mode: Can be "infrared" or "uhf". rx-mode should be present iff
+	  the rx pins are wired up.
+	- tx-mode: Can be "infrared" or "uhf". tx-mode should be present iff
+	  the tx pins are wired up.
+
+Optional properties:
+	- linux,rc-map-name: Linux specific remote control map name. Refer to
+	  include/media/rc-map.h for full list of maps.
+	- pinctrl-names, pinctrl-0: The pincontrol settings to configure muxing
+	  properly for the device pins.
+	- clocks : phandle with clock-specifier pair for the device specified
+	  in compatible.
+
+example:
+
+	rc: rc@fe518000 {
+		compatible	= "st,comms-irb";
+		reg		= <0xfe518000 0x234>;
+		interrupts	= <0 203 0>;
+		rx-mode		= "infrared";
+	};
