Subject: [PATCH] [media] ngene: Use newly created function

The function demod_attach_drxd was split into two by commit 36a495a3.
This resulted in a new function tuner_attach_dtt7520x that is not used.
We should register tuner_attach_dtt7520x as a callback in the ngene_info
struct in the same way as done with the other part of the split function.

Sparse warning:

drivers/media/pci/ngene/ngene-cards.c:333:12: warning:
        ‘tuner_attach_dtt7520x’ defined but not used [-Wunused-function]

This patch is a guess at what was intended. I'm not familiar with this code
and I don't have the hardware to test it.
