I don't know the regulator framework very well, but do you mean creating 
a new regulator which just controls a gpio? It would be preferrable that 
this wouldn't create a new driver nor add any board core.

No. The chip is always powered on the N900 but pulling down (or up, I 
don't remember) its reset pin puts the chip to reset and causes the 
current draw to reach almost zero. I think it's in the class of some or 
few tens of µA. Someone still might implement a board containing the 
adp1653 which would require enabling a regulator for it.
