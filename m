I'm trying to put together a driver for the AverMedia A188, which is currently unsupported. Manu Abraham is working on the SAA716x driver which it needs, but the frontends seem to be two LGDT3304's. 

My google-fu is failing me and I can't find any documentation on the chip. Support for the chip was committed last year, but I don't see any drivers actually using it.

Does anyone have any documentation for the chip, or even better, some examples of how to set it up for a driver. Also I don't know how to find their I2C addresses.

Thanks for any help in advance.
