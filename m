I'll try this patch and report back ,,

Will verify this if the page is found on the pcp list as well .

With this, when it failed the page_count()
returned a value of 2. I am not sure why, but I will try and see If I can
reproduce this.

I was going to suggest that, moving the check until after outer_start
is calculated
will definitely help IMO. I am sure I've seen a case where

  page_count(page) = page->private = 0 and PageBuddy(page) was false.

I will try and reproduce this as well.
