Hm, in digging through the udev tree, the only change I found was this
one:

commit 39177382a4f92a834b568d6ae5d750eb2a5a86f9

    udev: firmware - do not cancel requests in the initrd

         }
 

which went into udev release 187 which I think corresponds to the place
when people started having problems, right Mauro?

If so, Mauro, is the solution just putting the firmware into the initrd?
No wait, it looks like this change was trying to fix the problem where
firmware files were not in the initrd, so it would stick around for the
real root to show up so that they could be loaded.  So this looks like
it was fixing firmware loading problems for people?

Kay, am I just looking at the totally wrong place here, and this file in
udev didn't have anything to do with the breakage?

thanks,

greg k-h
