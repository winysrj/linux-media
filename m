You don't want to clear them via their uncached or WC mapping, but via
their cached mapping _before_ they get their alternative mapping, and
flush any cached out of that mapping - both L1 and L2 caches.

For lowmem pages, that's easy.  For highmem pages, they need to be
individually kmap'd to zero them etc.  (alloc_pages() warns on
GFP_HIGHMEM + GFP_ZERO from atomic contexts - and dma_alloc_coherent
must be callable from such contexts.)

That may be easier now that we don't have the explicit indicies for
kmap_atomics, but at that time it wasn't easily possible.

CMA's whole purpose for existing is to provide _dma-able_ contiguous
memory for things like cameras and such like found on crippled non-
scatter-gather hardware.  If that memory is not DMA-able what's the
point?
