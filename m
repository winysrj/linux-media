Is this strictly true if we are introducing a new 'enum v4l2_memory'
for dmabuf's?  Shouldn't that give us some flexibility, especially if
the v4l2 device is only the importer, not the allocator, of the
memory.

and a couple more notes:
1) for V4L2_MEMORY_DMABUF we don't want the importing v4l2 device to
create a userspace memory mapping
2) there is nothing stopping a dmabuf exporter from being more strict
about static allocation of buffers..  we just want the API to be
flexible enough so that exporting devices which are more dynamic can
continue to do so.

The exporter doesn't map.. it returns a scatterlist to the importer.
But the exporter does allocate and pin backing pages.  And it is
preferable if the exporter has the opportunity to wait until as much
is known about the various importing devices to know if it must
allocate contiguous pages, or pages in a certain range.

That said, on a platform where everything had iommu's or somehow
didn't have any particular memory requirements, or where the exporter
had the strictest requirements (or at least knew of the strictest
requirements), then the exporter is free to allocate/pin the backing
pages earlier, such as even before the buffer is exported.
