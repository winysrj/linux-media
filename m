So that's the same that I'm using.

And that works, I assume? Does the second choice in the newer Flash
version work maybe?

Ok, Same here.

Yes, we need to trace the call chain and see at which point the trouble
starts. What could help is tracing the google-chrome binary with strace
maybe. At least we would see the ioctl command sequence, if the log file
survives the crash.

As the usb list is still in Cc: - Artem's lcpci dump shows that his
machine features XHCI controllers. Can anyone think of a relation to
this problem?

And Artem, is there any way you boot your system on an older machine
that only has EHCI ports? Thinking about it, I wonder whether the freeze
in VBox and the crashes on native hardware have the same root cause. In
that case, would it be possible to share that VBox image?
