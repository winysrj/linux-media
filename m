The latter is not true, you can`t view/record DVB-S and DVB-T at once.
That would need a second saa7131 PCI bridge you don't have.

It is one tda8275a hybrid tuner, which in this case is only used for
radio and analog TV, a second tda8275a hybrid tuner, which is only used
for DVB-T on this card with tda10046 channel decoder and a single
tda826x tuner for DVB-S with tda10086 channel decoder and isl6421 ...

We need to go through the code in question, investigate Ubuntu
downports, reread datasheets as far as available (!) and my first guess
is your switch worked once with diseqc enabled on the tda10086, at least
for low. On high with permanent tone from the isl6121 also enabled, I
doubt it ever came through.

Hermann
