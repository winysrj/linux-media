OK, that sounds like a good way to solve this as well.
I'm very new to this subsystem, so I don't know what layer should
perform what function.

I think it's the out-of-tree saa716x_tbs_dvb driver:

[    7.670565] input: saa716x IR (TurboSight TBS 6281) as
/devices/pci0000:00/0000:00:1c.0/0000:02:00.0/rc/rc0/input6
[    7.671156] rc0: saa716x IR (TurboSight TBS 6281) as
/devices/pci0000:00/0000:00:1c.0/0000:02:00.0/rc/rc0

So I'll have to rework this patch to function at this lower level, and
try to upstream it to TBS. Thank you for your time!

I see what you mean, but I don't see how the proposed patch fails in
this sense. Or were you referring to the proposal of adding a timer at
the ir-nec-decoder level?
