There is: it violates both V4L2 API and I2C error fault code. -ENODEV should
only be used on device probing time, according with
Documentation/i2c/fault-codes [1]:
	ENODEV
		Returned by driver probe() methods. 

[1] V4L2 spec also allows using it at device removal (e. g. when the
USB device is physically disconnected).

According with I2C fault codes, the proper error for a timeout is ETIMEDOUT:

	ETIMEDOUT
		This is returned by drivers when an operation took too much
		time, and was aborted before it completed.

		SMBus adapters may return it when an operation took more
		time than allowed by the SMBus specification; for example,
		when a slave stretches clocks too far.  I2C has no such
		timeouts, but it's normal for I2C adapters to impose some
		arbitrary limits (much longer than SMBus!) too.

No, it depends if the code is called during probing time or not. Outside
device probing, an I2C driver should _never_ return ENODEV.

You can't affirm that the device isn't present.

Let remind a conversation we had with Devin at #v4l back on Seg 27 Mai 2013,
where he checked those error codes on his datasheets:

(16:23:05) mchehab: btw, talking about missing data, register 0x05 is also not documented, although it is one of the most used register
(16:24:11) frankschaefer: This is definitely no kernel bloating.
(16:24:29) devinheitmueller: 5[5] is busy and 5[4] is aborted. Last I checked the driver implemented them properly so I didn't see a need for anything additional.
(16:25:17) frankschaefer: "busy" and "aborted" what ?
(16:25:22) devinheitmueller: i2c.
(16:25:40) devinheitmueller: Oh wait, busy was only on em2874. But aborted was on both versions of the chip.

Again, according with Documentation/i2c/fault-codes, for an I2C
aborted I/O, the error code is ETIMEDOUT.

When originally written, the only case where -ENODEV was returned was 
during I2C device probing time (I2C reads or writes with size equal to 
zero).

Latter patches corrupted it, and added -ENODEV to be returned outsize
the probing time.

> Changing it based on such fragile theories is no good idea.

The API specs is not a fragile theory. Is a document to be followed,
to warrant compliance.
