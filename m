I rewrote the tda998x as a simple encoder+connector (i.e. not a
slave_encoder) with your component helper, and the code is much clearer
and simpler: the DRM driver has nothing to do except to know that the
tda998x is a component and to set the possible_crtcs.

AFAIK, only the tilcdc drm driver is using the tda998x as a
slave_encoder. It does a (encoder+connector) conversion to
(slave_encoder). Then, in your changes in the TDA998x, you do a
(slave_encoder) translation to (encoder+connector).
This seems rather complicated!

I think it would be easier to use your component helper and rewrite
(remove?) tilcdc_slave.c.

This function exists already in drivers/of/platform.c as
of_dev_node_match(). It just needs to be exported.
