Possibly. I'm certainly confused now. You brought up the component
helpers in drivers/base/component.c, so I thought working out
dependencies is part of the purpose of this binding. Everything I've
heard so far has given me the impression that the graph binding is tied
up with knowing when all of the devices exist.

How device drivers get connected together may not strictly be a property
of hardware, but it absolutely is informed by hardware topology.
