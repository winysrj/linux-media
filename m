Hello,

I need a replacement for an aging box that is using xawtv to display 
CCTV cameras (from a BT878 card) on a X windows display. Xawtv is 
capable of hardware overlay directly onto the X display with almost no 
CPU usage and pretty much real time, it has worked great for years.. but 
now the box needs modern hardware and software. I have attempted to 
compile xawtv using more modern versions of linux.. but I think xawtv is 
just too old to mess with at this point.. so the question is..

Anyone know of any other suitable software that will allow analog video 
overlay from BT878 chips?

(and hopefully this is the correct forum for this!)

Thank you

Regards,
-Moses
