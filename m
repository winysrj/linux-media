Subject: [PATCH RFC v2 0/4] media: davinci: vpif: capture/display support for async subdevice probing

This patch series adds support for vpif capture and display
driver to support asynchronously register subdevices.
The first two patches adds asynchronous probing for adv7343
and tvp514x respectively.

Need for this support:
Currently bridge device drivers register devices for all subdevices
synchronously, typically, during their probing. E.g. if an I2C CMOS sensor
is attached to a video bridge device, the bridge driver will create an I2C
device and wait for the respective I2C driver to probe. This makes linking
of devices straight forward, but this approach cannot be used with
intrinsically asynchronous and unordered device registration systems like
the Flattened Device Tree.

This series is dependent on following patches:
1: https://patchwork.kernel.org/patch/2437111/
2: https://patchwork.linuxtv.org/patch/18096/

Changes for v2:
1: added support v4l-async support for vpif display driver.
2: added asynchronous probing for adv7343.
