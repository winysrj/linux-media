Good to know. Yes, I was on vacation, just returning back and trying to get rid
of the immense amount of emails and spams from my inboxes...

To be clear, the dead line for the LPC conf is by July, 26, but we still have 
more time for the mini-conf tracks.

No, they won't conflict. My "proposal" is for leading the mini-conf panel, and not
for the presentation itself (it is not really a proposal - it is just the way it
is defined for the panel leads to register the panels).
