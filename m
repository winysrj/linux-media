Well, first up, of course the 'migration of backing storage' is an
orthogonal problem to what this patchset attempts to do - in this, I
am only try to make the relevant information available to the
exporter.

With that out of the way, some thoughts on what you mentioned:

So, IF the exporter needs to support migration of backing storage,
even when subsystem Y has mapped the buffer, the exporter knows this
(because of the map_dma_buf() dma_buf_op) - and the attach() also is
notified to / handled by the exporter. With this information, it could
either:
a) not let the subsystem Z attach (the 'simpler' approach), or
b) hold enough state-information about the Z's attach request
internally, then migrate the pages on the unmap_attachment() callback
from the subsystem Y?

(The exact details for this will need to be thought-of by exporters
actually trying to do migration of pages, or delayed allocation, or
such, though)

Thanks for pointing that out; I guess we'd have to disallow the
attachment which would make that happen. I can add this as another
check in calc_constraints().

Another thanks for making me rack my puny brain on these scenarios! :)
