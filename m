This isn't right.  There are USB host controllers that use PIO, not
DMA.  The HAS_DMA dependency should go with the controller driver, not 
the USB core.

On the other hand, the USB core does call various routines like 
dma_unmap_single.  It ought to be possible to compile these calls even 
when DMA isn't enabled.  That is, they should be defined as do-nothing 
stubs.

That seems reasonable.
