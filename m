Hi all

Now I have mt9t112 / ov772x soc-camera.
And it can change fps by register setting.
So, I would like to add such support to driver.

But I don't know how to order it from user program.
Can you please teach me about it ?

# in my easy search, using ioctrl with VIDIOC_S_PARM
# seems good, I'm not sure though

Best regards
