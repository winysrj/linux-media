I am skeptical about all this for a variety of reasons:

1) The data_offset field is well-defined in the spec. There really is no doubt
about the meaning of the field.

2) We really don't know who else might be using it, or which applications might
be using it (a lot of work was done in gstreamer recently, I wonder if data_offset
support was implemented there).

3) You offer no alternative to this feature. Basically this is my main objection.
It is not at all unusual to have headers in front of the frame data. We (Cisco)
use it in one of our product series for example. And I suspect it is something that
happens especially in systems with an FPGA that does custom processing, and those
systems are exactly the ones that are generally not upstreamed and so are not
visible to us.

IMHO the functionality it provides is very much relevant, and I would like to see
an alternative in place before it is repurposed.

But frankly, I really don't see why you would want to repurpose it. Adding a new
field (buf_offset) would do exactly what you want it to do without causing an ABI
change.

Should we ever implement a better alternative for data_offset, then that field can
be renamed to 'reserved2' or whatever at some point.

Frankly, I don't think data_offset is all that bad. What is missing is info about
the format (so add a 'data_format' field) and possible similar info about a footer
(footer_size, footer_format). Yes, the name could have been better (header_size),
but nobody is perfect...

Regards,
