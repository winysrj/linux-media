Since I brought up the architecture removal independently, I could
pick this up into a git tree that also has the removal of some of the
other architectures.

I see your tree is part of linux-next, so you could also just put it
in there and send a pull request at the merge window if you prefer.

The only real reason I see for a shared git tree would be to avoid
conflicts when we touch the same Kconfig files or #ifdefs in driver,
but Meta only appears in

config FRAME_POINTER
        bool "Compile the kernel with frame pointers"
        depends on DEBUG_KERNEL && \
                (CRIS || M68K || FRV || UML || \
                 SUPERH || BLACKFIN || MN10300 || METAG) || \
                ARCH_WANT_FRAME_POINTERS

and

include/trace/events/mmflags.h:#elif defined(CONFIG_PARISC) ||
defined(CONFIG_METAG) || defined(CONFIG_IA64)

so there is little risk.
