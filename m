Yep, could be, while I would write the core part to set the DMA_SLAVE
unconditionally anyways. If the API say it is dma_request_slavechan() it is
expected to get channel which is capable of DMA_SLAVE.

Let me think aloud here a bit...
1. To request slave channel which will return you the channel your device is
bind via DT/ACPI or the platform map table you propose later:

dma_request_chan(struct device *dev, const char *name);

2. To request a channel (any channel) matching with the capabilities the
driver needs, like memcpy, memset, etc:

#define dma_request_chan_by_mask(mask) __dma_request_chan_by_mask(&(mask))
__dma_request_chan_by_mask(const dma_cap_mask_t *mask);

I think the dma_request_chan() does not need mask to be passed, since via this
we request a specific channel which has been defined/set by DT/ACPI or the
lookup map. We could add a mask parameter which could be used to sanity check
the channel we got against the capabilities the driver needs from the channel.
We currently do this in the drivers where the author wanted to make sure that
the channel is capable of what it should be capable.

So two API to request channel:
struct dma_chan *dma_request_chan(struct device *dev, const char *name);
struct dma_chan *dma_request_chan_by_mask(const dma_cap_mask_t *mask);

Both will return with the valid channel pointer or in case of failure with
ERR_PTR().

We need to go through the code in regards to return codes also to have sane
mapping.

sa11x0-dma expects the fn_param as string :o

Basically we are deprecating the use of IORESOURCE_DMA?

For legacy the filter function is pretty much needed to handle the differences
between the platforms as not all of them does the filtering in a same way. So
the first type of map would be feasible IMHO.

This will get rid of the need for the fn and fn_param parameters when
requesting dma channel, but it will not get rid of the exported function from
the dma engine drivers since in arch code we need to have visibility to the
filter_fn.
