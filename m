I agree with Patrick. I suggest a daily automatic posting to linux-dvb 
and video4linux telling people that on February 1st these lists 
disappear and that they should use linux-media instead. Then they can 
be closed down at the end of the month. I definitely wouldn't wait any 
longer since it is rather messy right now. One month transition period 
seems reasonable to me.

Regards,
