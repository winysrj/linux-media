For QBUF the only difference is that we set flags for fences and pass
and receives in and out fences. For DQBUF the behavior is exactly the
same. What incompatibles or hacks do you see?

I had the expectation that the flags would be for userspace to learn
about any different behavior.

I'm pretty new to v4l2 so I don't know all use cases yet, but what I
thought was to just add extra flags to QBUF to mark when using fences
instead of having userspace  to setup completely new ioctls for fences.
The burden for userspace should be smaller with flags.

DRM plane is a different thing, its a representation of a region on the
screen and there is only one buffer for each DRM plane. 

One of the questions I raised was: how to match V4L2 per-plane fences to
DRM per-buffer fences?

Yes. It should do something similar behind the Framebuffer abstraction.

I believe we can just extend the per-plane parts of QBUF for their
fences. We could even use plane[0] for the per-buffer case.

Can you explain what you were thinking on the relation between fences
and reservation objects? Not sure I follow.
