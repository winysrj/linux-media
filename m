Well, then we'll break Ubuntu again as they recompiled their input-utils
package (without fixing the check). And the rest of distros do not seem
to be using that package...

I believe that -EINVAL thing only affects RC devices that Mauro switched
to the new rc-core; input core in itself should be ABI compatible. Thus
I'll leave the decision to him whether he wants to revert or fix
compatibility issue.

It might not have been the best idea to increment, however I maintain
that if there exists version is can be changed. Otherwise there is no
point in having version at all.

As I said, reverting the version bump will cause yet another wave of
breakages so I propose leaving version as is.

That has been done as well; we have 2 new ioctls and kept 2 old ioctls.
