This seems to be a boolean property, and I couldn't find any description
in the linked datasheet of the constraints under which the unit may be
put into sleep mode.

Why do we require this property in the dt? Can the driver not always put
a adv734x into sleep mode if it wants to, and then wake it up as
required?

This affects whether or not oversampling is possible. That sounds like
it should be a run-time configurable rather than a fixed property of the
device.

Why do we need this property at all? Might some DACs not be wired up to
anything?

Surely this could be configured at run-time as and when the user wants
to use the DACs.

Again, couldn't this be done at run-time?

Do we need to permanently disable/enable some DACs? If so, why?

I also note from the spec that the unit has two clocks, CLKIN_A and
CLKIN_B that aren't in the binding, but should be. Some regulators
too (VDD, PVDD, VAA, VDD_IO, VREF?).

Thanks,
Mark.
