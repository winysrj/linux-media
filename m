Subject: [Q]: any DVB-S2 card which is 45MS/s capable?

If someone has tested a DVB-S2 card at 45MS/s (I am interested in QPSK 
moslty) please speak out ;-).
I dont need CI, dual tuner can be a bonus but definitely not mandatory.
I already asked the question, so sorry to come back again with it, but I 
did not get a clear answer: the only thing I know is that STV0900 is 
able to do it, but I guess that the board itself must be well thought 
out to achieve these high rates?
TIA
Bye
Manu
