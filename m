The DMA API for coherent memory (dma_alloc_coherent) returns both an
DMA address and a kernel-space virtual address because it does both
allocation and mapping.

However, other DMA API (dma_map_*) returns only an DMA address because
it does only mapping.

I think that if we need new API for coherent memory, we could
unify it with the DMA API for coherent memory.

IMO, it's cleaner to having two separate APIs for allocation and
mapping (except for coherent memory). The drivers have been working
in that way.
