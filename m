This driver is currently missing an active maintainer, as it is for an old
hardware (AFAIK, omap is now at version 4, and this is for the first one),
but I'm c/c a few developers that might help to test and analyze it.

In any case, /me is assuming that your patch is right (as nobody complained),
and I'm applying it right now on my tree. This will hopefully allow some
people to test.

Cheers,
Mauro
