  Just for the records: I'm "in favor" of the merge, not against... Or 
have I missunderstood the post I replied to? Never mind. :)

  I'm a "user-only" of my PVR150/350 since about 2 years and I read 
these lists (ivtv-devel, ivtv-users, video4linux, and now linux-media) 
because I want to stay in touch with the really good work you developers 
are doing (also a "Thank you" from my wife, who loves our VDR). And I 
want to know when some of the issues I encounter are solved, so I can 
update my kernel. Sadly I haven't the time to invest my 
development-knowledge into linux-driver-development (my daily work is 
application-development, and yes, it's windows, shame on me ;-)).
  So, if the lists get merged or not, I still will be reading them. I 
just want to give a view from a passive reader. And from that point of 
view a merge would be fine...
  But I agree that the main developers should be the ones that have the 
final stay on this.

Lars.
