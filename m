Probably this is a good time for some inventory to be done.

 sure of the exact number of drivers. The jeilinj driver does not count 
here. It is a standard mass storage device as a still camera, and if it is 
going to be hooked up as a webcam then it has to have some buttons pushed 
just so, prior to hookup -- after which it comes up with a different USB 
Product number as a proprietary webcam device, supported by the jeilinj 
driver. Thus, this is not one of the droids we are looking for.

Specifically, the currently affected drivers are sq905, sq905c, mr97310a, 
and sn9c2028. 

Fuji Finepix seems to produce both still cameras (PTP protocol) and 
webcams. If there are currently any dual-mode cameras, it is not obvious. 
Perhaps any of these which can be dual mode are like the jeilinj cameras 
and come up under different Product numbers in the different modes, which 
is not a problem. 

There do seem to exist stv06xx dual-mode cameras:

stv0680/stv0680.c:      { "STM:USB Dual-mode camera",   0x0553, 0x0202, 1 
},

is found in camlibs/stv0680, for example, along with a whole bunch of 
other cameras with the same Vendor:Product number. It seems, too, that the 
same Vendor:Product number is listed in gspca/stv0680.c

So I guess we found another affected driver.


The intersection seems to be void between the lists of the spca50x cameras 
and webcams, though one can not be certain about the future. I do know of 
another dualmode camera, powered by the JL2005A chip. I wrote a kernel 
module for it some months ago. Said module has not been sent upward 
because of mysterious issues with one of the three cameras used for 
testing it.

We also find among the gspca driver files this

* GSPCA sub driver for W996[78]CF JPEG USB Dual Mode Camera Chip.
 *
 * Copyright (C) 2009 Hans de Goede <hdegoede@redhat.com>

but I am not sure about which cameras are using this.
