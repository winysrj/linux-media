Hi,

I have digged a little bit deeper in the code and hopefully found a more general solution 
by initializing the voltage in dvb_frontend.c in the function dvb_register_frontend.
This should be a more global approach which may also fix this type of problems
with other cards. I will test this patch the next days on a different system with a 
CineS2 V5.5 card.

Any opinions about this patch or is my first attempt with patching only the code
for the Tevii S480 a better solution?
