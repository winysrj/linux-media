Hello Honza,

I still support the inclusion of your virtual DVB device driver, once
the technical issues[1] are solved (design clean interface based on
DVBv5 etc.). Mauro promised to consider it for inclusion then[2]. A
quick view at your code indicates that this clean-up hasn't happened
yet, e.g. there are hacks to support DVB-S2 over DVBv3 which aren't
necessary anymore with v5.

Regarding the kernellabs.com people[3] lobbying against your
contribution: Don't give up! If all attempts of merging your work
through the media subsystem are failing, try convincing some major
distributions to include your work. This would make their arguments
meaningless. On the long run, good code is likely to win over politics.

Regards,
Andreas
