Well, I'm seeing those warnings on 2.6.37-rc1, after the patch that re-enable
the warnings. Just reverting the delay symbol direct dependency init changeset 
makes the warnings stop.

I didn't really try to run lots of tests to be sure that they actually break
anything, or if they are just unwanted warnings, but, in any case, we need a
fix before the end of .37 cycle.

A solution like what was done on i2c doesn't seem nice, as it will require lots
of artificial changes at kconfig stuff. Maybe it would be better to just add
some logic at Kconfig file to specify those kind of menus without producing
warnings, of course assuming that actually won't break symbols dependency solve.

Thanks,
Mauro
