Hi All

I saw this post and made some enquiries: 
http://www.spinics.net/lists/linux-media/msg23091.html
I have confirmation  that the card is no longer available and has been 
replaced with Dvico FusionHDTV DVB-T Dual Express2.
Has anyone previously heard of it / done any development on it or have 
any thoughts on how to get it working?

Regards
Drappa
