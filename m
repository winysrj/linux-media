I don't know what's wrong with your installation, but you may want to
try installing the mantis driver without completely replacing the
dvb-core.

FYI, the mantis driver will be included in the next Debian 2.6.32 based
kernel release thanks to the excellent Debian kernel team:
http://bugs.debian.org/57724 . I guess that means that it will be
available in Unbuntu soon as well.

Anyway, the patch from that bug report should easily apply to any 2.6.32
kernel without having to mess with the whole DVB system.
