This sounds like a case for implicit shared fences. ;-) Reading and scanning out would
only wait for the last 'exclusive' fence, not on each other.

But in drivers/drm I can encounter a similar issue, people expect to be able to
overwrite the contents of the currently displayed buffer, so I 'solved' it by not adding
a fence on the buffer, only by waiting for buffer idle before page flipping.
The rationale is that the buffer is pinned internally, and the backing storage cannot
go away until dma_buf_unmap_attachment is called. So when you render to the
current front buffer without queuing a page flip you get exactly what you expect. ;-)

Yeah, but the kernel space primitives would in both cases be the same, so drivers don't need to implement 2 separate fencing mechanisms for that. :-)
