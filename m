Hi Luca,

Removing the sn9c102 is on the way for a long time. I think we were just
waiting for a message from you!

Why is gspca in the kernel? Because of its design: all the system / v4l2
interface are in the main driver, while the subdrivers only deal with
the specific device exchanges. This simplifies development and
maintenance.

At the beginning, the gspca did not handle the sn9c102 webcams (but
some Sonix based webcams were already handled only by gspca). From time
to time, there were users saying that their webcams did not work
correctly with the sn9c102, and that they worked better with gspca. So,
we moved their IDs to gspca.

Now, the sonixjb and sonixj subdrivers handle many more sensors than
the sn9c102 with less problems. Indeed, there are still problems, but,
as I have only 3 webcams (none with Sonix chips), I must wait for user
reports and fix them.

As you have some Sonix based webcams, and as you had contact with the
manufacturers, you should easily find if there are wrong sequences in
the gspca subdrivers and/or what could be done for a better support.
This would help...

Regards.
