Hi,
I'm trying to find out if it's possible to use unicable with DVB-S/S2 
cards and how it's
supported in Linux DVB.

According to 
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_Cable_Distribution#Equipment it 
might only need software changes to
work. It seems to work with DiSEqC commands but I dont't know which 
version of DisEqC that's required.
It also seems like there are images for dreambox for unicable.

Does anyone know something about this?

Regards
Claes
