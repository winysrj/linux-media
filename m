Oh, yes. They are Proprietary devices. And that means what it says. :-)
And all different from each other, too.

I think everyone involved believes that it would solve the problem. 

The question has been all along whether or not there is any other way 
which would work. Also the question of what, exactly, "belongs" in the 
kernel and what does not. For, if something has been historically 
supported in userspace (stillcam support, in this case) and has worked 
well there, I would think it is kind of too bad to have to move said 
support into the kernel just because the same hardware requires kernel 
support for another functionality and the two sides clash. I mean, the 
kernel is already big enough, no? But the logic that Hans has set forth 
seems rather compelling.
