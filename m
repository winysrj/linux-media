Hi Mauro,

For those of us who are new to the project, how soon can we expect you
to create the remote for 3.3 (/staging_for_v3.3, I'm guessing the name
will be)?  A ballpark timeframe (rough guess, in other words) is fine
since a lot will depend on when the 3.2 kernel will be released, I'd guess.

Thanks, and have a great day:)
Patrick.
