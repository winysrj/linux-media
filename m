Ah, it's been a few months since I looked at that. I think some of the
things listed I had already identified as problems - checkpatch especially,
and the irq code probably needs a bit more auto-detection.
I'm not sure I've seen how the other issues manifest themselves so I
might need some explanation of that (off list if you prefer)

Is this the module parameter kludges or something else?

Hence my comment about finding a maintainer - I had assumed if the
immediate result didn't support your card you probably wouldn't be willing
to do that.

What I'm trying to do here is get *something* merged, and then once
that work is done any interested parties can add to it. Or at the very
least if some patches are left OOT the constant workload required to
keep that up to date should be reduced significantly because they'll be
far less to look after.

One of the problems though is choosing which fork to use. I *think* there
are 2 - the one you've got which is the original powARman branch and the
one I would be using is the CrazyCat / Luis /Â  TBS line. There are going 
to be
some differences but hopefully that's all frontend support based and one cut
down to a single frontend would end up a good base to add the rest back
in.

I'm looking at maybe finding time over christmas break.
