Ah, I see. Well, if none of the in-kernel drivers use it, we can
drop it.

Btw, as it seems that now only lirc_zilog uses the Linux kernel
API, we could just move it to staging, under drivers/staging/media/lirc/,
remove all EXPORT_SYMBOL_* from it, and add it to the lirc_zilog
Makefile.

That probably meets the goal of avoiding people to write new
drivers based on it. Any other out of tree driver that might
be still using it could do the same, while such driver is not
converted to rc-core.

If they don't cause regressions, better to apply then ;)
As we're early at -rc, merging it now is a good idea, as people
will have more time to review.
