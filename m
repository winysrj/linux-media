Yes.

Ok, my fault. I've forgot to mention that this patch was almost ready 
during Linaro meeting, but I didn't manage to post it that time. Of course 
it doesn't fulfill all the agreements from that discussion.

I was only unsure if we should care about the case where CMA is not enabled
for ARMv6+ or not. This patch was prepared in assumption that 
dma_alloc_coherent should work in both cases - with and without CMA.

Now I assume that for ARMv6+ the CMA should be enabled unconditionally.
