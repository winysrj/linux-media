The mmp ccic driver expects a platform_data structure that does not exist
in the mainline kernel and presumably was changed in a kernel fork, which
leads to build errors now:

media/platform/marvell-ccic/mmp-driver.c: In function 'mmpcam_calc_dphy':
media/platform/marvell-ccic/mmp-driver.c:252:15: error: 'struct mmp_camera_platform_data' has no member named 'dphy3_algo'
  switch (pdata->dphy3_algo) {
               ^
media/platform/marvell-ccic/mmp-driver.c:253:7: error: 'DPHY3_ALGO_PXA910' undeclared (first use in this function)
  case DPHY3_ALGO_PXA910:
       ^
media/platform/marvell-ccic/mmp-driver.c:253:7: note: each undeclared identifier is reported only once for each function it appears in
media/platform/marvell-ccic/mmp-driver.c:257:8: error: 'struct mmp_camera_platform_data' has no member named 'dphy'

This marks the driver as 'BROKEN' but keeps the code around.
Alternatively it could be removed entirely.

I've carried this workaround in a private git tree that has hundreds of
randconfig fixes, just started flushing out some of the patches again.
The configuration in which the driver gets selected is relatively rare,
and it is not enabled in any of the defconfigs obviously.

When I originally wrote the patch description, I must have missed the
fact that the driver was moved from a different directory and I only
saw that it was broken at the point when it showed up in
drivers/media/platform/marvell-ccic/.

Thanks

Done.
