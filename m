Hi Jon,

Thanks for digging into this. FWIW, here is my $0.02. I've been
working on restarting the devicetree specification, and after looking
at both reStructuredText and Asciidoc(tor) I thought I liked the
Asciidoc markup better, so chose that. I then proceeded to spend weeks
trying to get reasonable output from the toolchain. When I got fed up
and gave Sphinx a try, I was up and running with reasonable PDF and
HTML output in a day and a half.

Honestly, in the end I think we could make either tool do what is
needed of it. However, my impression after trying to do a document
that needs to have nice publishable output with both tools is that
Sphinx is easier to work with, simpler to extend, better supported. My
vote is firmly behind Sphinx/reStructuredText.
