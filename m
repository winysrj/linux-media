I'm setting up a new MythTV system with a DViCO FusionHDTV7 Dual
Express and I was able to figure out how to get the remote working
thanks to this wiki page (
http://linuxtv.org/wiki/index.php/Remote_controllers-V4L ).

I have found a few quotes by people who believe that only the remote
that came with the card will work, but I haven't found anything
definitive. So is it possible to use a different remote with the IR
Receiver on the card and LIRC?

Thanks,
Dave
