Speaking of which, mind if I kill sync_obj_arg? Only user is again vmwgfx and it always seems to pass the same
for flags, namely DRM_VMW_FENCE_FLAG_EXEC.

Yeah, that's why the ttm patch for ttm_bo_reserve_locked always calls dma_object_reserve with no_wait set to true. :)
It does its own EBUSY handling for the no_wait case, so there should be no functional changes.

I've been toying with the idea of always requiring a sequence number, I just didn't in the current patch yet
since it would mean converting every driver, so for a preliminary patch based on a unmerged api it was
not worth the time.

So if I understand it correctly it is the same as I'm doing in fences with dma_fence::enable_sw_signals?
Great, I don't need to add another op then. Although it looks like I should export a function to manually
enable it for those cases. :)

The documentation is still lacking, but they require the spinlocks to be taken by the caller,
else things explode. It's meant for updating fence and ending reservation atomically.
