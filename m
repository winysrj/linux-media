As it turns out, with some more testing on SMP systems, this whole patch
turned out to be incorrect.

We have been thinking about other approach and, if we were to use something
else then the first patch from CMAv17[1], the best thing we could came up
with was to unconditionally call drain_all_pages() at the beginning of
set_migratetype_isolate() before the call to spin_lock_irqsave().  It has
a possible race condition but a nightly stress test did have not shown any
problems.

Nonetheless, the cleanest, in my opinion, solution is to use the first patch
 from CMAv17 which can be found at [1].

So, to sum up: if you intend to test CMAv18, instead of applying this first
patch either use first patch from CMAv17[1] or put an unconditional call to
drain_all_pages() at the beginning of set_migrate_isolate() function.

Sorry for the troubles.
