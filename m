OK, so I couldn't help myself and I did this conversion. The code is here:

http://git.linuxtv.org/cgit.cgi/hverkuil/media_tree.git/log/?h=remcrop

And it introduces a new struct:

struct v4l2_subdev_pad_config {
        struct v4l2_mbus_framefmt try_fmt;
        struct v4l2_rect try_crop;
        struct v4l2_rect try_compose;
};

And subdev_fh now looks like this:

struct v4l2_subdev_fh {
        struct v4l2_fh vfh;
        struct v4l2_subdev_pad_config *pad;
};

But I realized that it could be simplified: right now we pass a pointer to
the pad config array to the pad ops and the v4l2_subdev_get_try_* functions
pick the right entry based on the pad index.

Wouldn't it be easier to pass the right pad config directly?

So instead of passing fh->pad in v4l2-subdev.c you pass e.g. 'fh->pad + sel->pad'.
That way the pad_config pointer points straight to the configuration of the
requested pad.

This also simplifies things in a bridge driver: it doesn't need to allocate
a pad config array, it only has to create pad config structs for those pads that
it actually uses.

And the v4l2_subdev_get_try_* functions can effectively be removed, since you
would just access cfg->try_fmt directly. I never liked those helper functions,
so I'm not sorry to see them go.

The only reason why this would fail is if drivers need to access the pad_config
of other pads than the one currently requested. I have not seen any code that
does that, though. And I don't think that is something we want anyway since
that would make things extremely complex.

Let me know what you think,

	Hans
