Hi all,

I have an HVR-1250 card working fine, but of course with the digital tuning 
only.  I was just wondering if there is any future worked planned for this 
chipset/card (Analog input, IR remote support)?  I've searched high and low 
for a datasheet for the chipset in order to try to finish up the driver, but 
I've been unsuccessful in finding anything.

Thanks!
