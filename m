Hi, I hope someone may be able to help me solve a problem or point me in 
the right direction.

I have been using a Leadtek Winfast DTV1800H card (ï»¿Xceive xc3028 tuner) 
for a while now without any issues (DTV & Radio have been working well), 
I recently decided to get another tuner card, Leadtek Winfast DTV2000DS 
(Tuner: NXP TDA18211, but detected as TDA18271 by V4L drivers, Chipset: 
AF9015 + AF9013 ) and had to compile and install the V4L drivers to get 
it working. Now DTV on both cards work well but there is a problem with 
the radio tuner on the 1800H card.

After installing the more recent V4L drivers the radio frequency is 
2.7MHz out, so if I want to listen to 104.9 I need to tune the radio to 
107.6. Now I could just change all my preset stations but I can not 
listen to my preferred stations as I need to set the frequency above 108MHz.

Andrew
