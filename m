Yeah, true. I forgot that, in the end of the day, we used a
different naming for SDR radio devnodes. I'll fix the comments.

Yes, I know.

Well, a DMABUF opaque handler like that actually refers to either a
buffer that is shared only between 2 devices or to a device-to-device
DMA transfer.

Such dataflow is different than the usual meaning of the video devnode,
where the devnode is used to do I/O transfers. So, it may actually 
be mapped as a different type of entity.

We'll need to discuss further when we start mapping this via MC.

I actually meant to say:

Almost entities do I/O and data streaming (exceptions are flash controller,
SEC and similar control subdevices). So, DATA_STREAMING, DATA_IO or IO
are a way too generic.

DMA is a little bit more restrictive than we wanted.

Actually, I originally named those as MEDIA_ENT_T_AV_BRIDGE, because
the hardware component that implements the device->CPU I/O is typically
a bridge. But then I went into the drivers, and I noticed that several
devices with just one bridge have several different entities for I/O.

So, I ran this script:
	$ git filter-branch -f --msg-filter 'cat && sed s,MEDIA_ENT_T_AV_BRIDGE,MEDIA_ENT_T_AV_DMA,g' origin/patchwork..
	$ git filter-branch -f --tree-filter 'for i in $(git grep -l MEDIA_ENT_T_AV_BRIDGE); do sed s,MEDIA_ENT_T_AV_BRIDGE,MEDIA_ENT_T_AV_DMA,g $i >a && mv a $i; done' origin/patchwork..

To replace the name everywere. Provided that we decide a better name,
this can be easily fixable by doing the above scripting.

Perhaps MEDIA_ENT_T_DEV_CPU_AV_IO would be a better name?

True, but how to distinguish such device from an ALSA DEV/CPU IO?

Answering myself, I see one alternative for that... we could use
MEDIA_ENT_T_DEV_CPU_IO for all device->CPU I/O devices, and use
properties to tell what APIs are valid on such entity. The bad thing
is that someone could add multiple "incompatible" APIs at the same
device (like ALSA, V4L and DVB - all on the dame sevnode).

I'm running out of ideas here ;)

In the lack of a better name, I would keep MEDIA_ENT_T_AV_DMA, as
it is the closest one to what's provided by such entities (or the
less wrong one).
