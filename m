What do you mean by "real network access"?  A virtual network connection
to the guest and host should be sufficient, right?

Not well-working ones, see the windows driver mailing list as well as
the libusb mailing list for problems that people are having due to there
not being any "official" Microsoft xhci drivers shipping yet.

Agreed.
