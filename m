It's not only NEC scancodes, the sw scancode filter is state that is 
changeable from user-space and which will require reader/writer 
synchronization during the RX path (which is the "hottest" path in 
rc-core). I've posted patches before which make the RX path lockless, 
this change makes complicates such changes.

Additionally, the provision of the sw fallback means that userspace has 
no idea if there is an actual hardware filter present or not, meaning 
that a userspace program that is aware of the scancode filter will 
always enable it.

So, I still think the SW part should be reverted, at least for now (i.e. 
the sysfs file should only be present if there is hardware support).
