I can't see how brx can be NULL. At the sequence of ifs:

	if (pipe->num_inputs > 2)
                brx = &vsp1->bru->entity;
        else if (pipe->brx && !drm_pipe->force_brx_release)
                brx = pipe->brx;
        else if (!vsp1->bru->entity.pipe)
                brx = &vsp1->bru->entity;
        else
                brx = &vsp1->brs->entity;


The usage of brx = &(something) will always return a non NULL
value[1]. The only clause where it doesn't use this pattern is:

	...
	if (pipe->brx && !drm_pipe->force_brx_release)
                brx = pipe->brx;
	...

This one explicitly checks if pipe->brx is NULL, so it will only
hit on a non-NULL value. If it doesn't hit, brx will be initialized
by a pointer too either bru or brs entity.

So, brx will always be non-NULL, even if pipe->brx is NULL.

[1] It might be doing a NULL deref - with seems to be your concern
    when you're talking about the case where vsp1->brs is NULL - but 
    that's not what Smatch is complaining here.

No, that's not Smatch assumption. If it where, it would print a different
kind of warning, at this statement:
	brx = &vsp1->brs->entity;

It only complains later at this line:

	format.pad = pipe->brx->source_pad;

because it thinks that pipe->brx can be NULL. This happens only if
pipe->brx is NULL and this if fails:

	/* Switch BRx if needed. */
        if (pipe->brx != brx) {

The brx dependency logic is complex, with, IMHO, tricks enough Smatch to
not be able of properly evaluate that the if will always be true if 
pipe->brx is NULL.
