Hi,

I bought some MSI DigiVox trio. I made a page for it on the wiki: 
http://linuxtv.org/wiki/index.php/MSI_DigiVox_Trio

So what I know is.. It shares several (if not all? maybe a clone?) 
components with the PCTV Quatrostick 520e. There was once some support 
(at least DVB-C) in em28xx-new.

Is there anything I can do now? I can't really code, but can copypast. I 
could probably make a machine with this stick plugged in available 
through SSH.

Any hope?

Best regards,

Pim
