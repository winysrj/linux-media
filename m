Yes, sorry - the whole series was supposed to be marked as RFC, but I didn't
think about it - and apparently only applied the tag to the cover letter.

Apologies for any confusion.

Does that mean you've done a cursory glance over the content ? :-)

In this instance, the port numbers need to revert back to a zero-base, but I
would appreciate an eye on how and where I've put the representation of the
physical hdmi/cvbs connectors. Having modified plenty of DT, but not actually
submitted much - I still feel 'new' at it - so I'm sure I may not have followed
the standards quite right yet.

The dts patches are based heavily on the previous posting by Niklas, but I have
extended to put the extra hdmi and cvbs links in.

Regards
