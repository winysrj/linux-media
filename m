why don't take gfp_t flags?

Something like dev_alloc_page is more appropriate name?

Or something similar to dmapool API (mm/dmapool.c) might work
better. The purpose of dmapool API is creating a pool for consistent
memory per device. It's similar to yours, creating a pool for
contiguous memory per device(s)?

I don't think that bootmem/memblock matters here since it's not the
API for drivers.

I'm not sure that's how a new feature is merged.
