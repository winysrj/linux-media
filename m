Since I'm the submaintainer these days for such patches I'm the one that
accepted them. Patches for 3.11 I keep here:

http://git.linuxtv.org/hverkuil/media_tree.git/shortlog/refs/heads/for-v3.11

I can't post a pull request for it yet since the 3.11 window isn't open yet,
but I'm collecting all patches there, otherwise things would just pile up.

Regards,
