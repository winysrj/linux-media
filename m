It can be easily increased for particular boards, there is no problem with this.

Your driver doesn't access video data inside kernel space, so this is also not an issue.

Then you MUST use cookie for it. vaddr method should return kernel virtual address 
to the buffer video data. Some parts of videobuf2 relies on this - it is used by file
io emulator (read(), write() calls) and mmap equivalent for non-mmu systems.

Manual casting in the driver is also a bad idea, that's why there are helper functions
defined for both dma_contig and dma_sg allocators: vb2_dma_contig_plane_dma_addr() and
vb2_dma_sg_plane_desc().
