I couldn't agree more with the last sentence in the above quote.  It's
ridiculous at best that after months now there is _still_ no proper
documentation, yet there was plenty of time when the task-at-hand was
making up s2api and pushing it into the kernel as fast as possible.
I'd love to hear a good reason why this documentation doesn't exist,
or why the people politely asking for help are being completely
ignored since the  "I've been busy" excuse is laughable.

Sorry, I've seen many people expressing frustration over this and many
other things from recent times.
