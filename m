As far as I can tell, these same security issues exist today.  I don't 
see them getting any worse than they are now.

No, not deadlocks.  Just -EBUSY errors.

That's true.  The program can't assume that a kernel driver was ever 
bound to the device; all it can assume is that _if_ a kernel driver was 
bound then it left the device in a sane state -- whatever "sane" might 
mean in this context.

I'm not against moving the whole thing into the kernel.  I'm just
pointing out that an easier-to-code-up solution will accomplish much
the same result.
