As you probably noticed, we had a tester in the RH bug report success
with the commit you included yesterday.

Do you think this is something worth including in the stable kernels
after it gets some further testing during the merge window?  Perhaps
not that specific commit as there seems to be some additional changes
needed for configurable paths, etc, but a backport of the fleshed out
changeset might be wanted.

We have a new enough udev in Fedora 17 to hit this issue with 3.5 and
3.6 when we rebase.  I'm sure other distributions will be in similar
circumstances soon if they aren't already.  Udev isn't going to be
fixed, so having something working in these cases would be great.
