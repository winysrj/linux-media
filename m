Hi Laurent
I have seen that a long time ago you had done some prototyping work for exposing framebuffer devices as media entities:
http://www.spinics.net/lists/linux-fbdev/msg04408.html

What did happen to this prototyping ?
Seems it has never been merged, so could you please explain why ?

We have some similar needs, so I'd like to understand the right way to go

Thanks in advance

Regards
Sebastien
