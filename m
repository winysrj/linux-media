I'm living in The Netherlands and am looking for a DVB-C USB device 
that's available, supported and (preferably) affordable. Devices that 
are available and affordable would appear to be the Delock DVB-C USB 
stick (which I can't find a whole lot about) and the MSI DigiVox mini Trio.

According to a message on the mailinglist from 2010 by Matthias Larisch:

"I recently bought a DigiVox Trio by MSI. This card contains the
following chips:

nxp tda18271hdc2 (tuner)
micronas drx 3926ka3 (demodulator, 3in1)
em2884
atmlh946 64c (eeprom)
micronas avf 4910ba1

so it is comparable to the Terratec Cinergy HTC USB XS HD and the
TerraTec H5."

Back in 2010 it didn't work, but I've noticed the EM2884 and Micronas 
DRX 3926K (maybe not the same?) and TDA18271HDC2 do work in the PCTV
QuatroStick nano. (http://linuxtv.org/wiki/index.php/DVB-C_USB_Devices) 
So perhaps the MSI could also work?

Or maybe someone has suggestions for a suitable device. Most of the 
devices on the wiki page are sadly either unavailable or very expensive.

Best regards,

Pim
