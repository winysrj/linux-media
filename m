Sounds like we don't have a clear direction on open/close or capture
start/stop. What I am hearing is open/close isn't acceptable for
media maintainers and capture trigger start/stop isn't acceptable
to sound maintainers. :) Fork in the road, which way do we go?

Implementation wise, supporting capture trigger start/stop approach
will be harder to maintain in longterm. It adds more variables to
the mix. Applications open sounds device from the main thread and
then create a new thread to handle streams. I can see that based
on the token hold requests that come in. So the token hold logic
will have to take that into account, leading into potential
unbalanced lock/unlock scenarios. It is not impossible to solve,
that's what I did in this patch series, but it does get complex.

What I am looking for is some consensus on let's go with an approach
and try. Doesn't matter which way we go, and how much testing I do,
I am bound to miss something and this work needs to soak for a bit in
the media experimental branch.
