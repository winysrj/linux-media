Let's refer to this as 'stateful' decoders and 'stateless' decoders. This
is the preferred terminology (and much more descriptive than 'Stream' vs
'Frame'). It's also not really a new API, although it does rely on the
Request API.

That's indeed typically signaled through the pixelformat.

As long as the V4L2 driver underpins the various solutions I am happy :-)

I do think that having a libv4l plugin will be useful since it will make
it easy for applications that support the stateful decoder to use the
same code for a stateless decoder by seamlessly using the plugin.

This does not prevent other approaches at the same time, of course.
