Hi guys,

Unfortunately, there were a crash at the server that I use for my inboxes. Due
to that, I lost several non-proccessed pull requests and e-mail patches that
should be committed into v4l-dvb tree and forward to kernel.

While I still hope that people will recover the lost e-mails, it would be safer
if those of you that forwarded me a patch, to re-send they to my inbox.

I kindly ask you to send those requests to me, c/c the lists, with the magic
tags at the subject:
[PATCH (resend)] - for patches that you're re-sending to me
[PULL (resend)] - for hg pull requests that you're re-sending



Cheers,
Mauro
