Sorry, I'm not sure I understand what exactly you're proposing. Please, 
just look at my last reply, in which I explain, why I don't think this is 
a good way to fix things. You don't need to support various formats 
natively on CSI / IPU to be able to just pass data 1-to-1. If that is your 
only purpose, please, test it that way, and if it is broken, please, fix 
it. This would be good even if you actually want to support formats 
natively eventually, because that would also fix other formats with 
similar sample-per-pixel values. When this is fixed, if you want to 
actually support formats natively to perform some hardware-assisted format 
conversions, that also can be done, but then, please, explain this clearly 
in your patch (series).

Thanks
Guennadi
