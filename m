Works for me.

I'm not sure if it works, as the table parser doesn't call that code.
Ok, some library client could use it, but I don't think that this is
actually being used on tvdaemon.

The big problem with the service list descriptor is that there's a
field commented on its structure. Once we decide to implement it,
we'll need to uncomment such field or to replace it with something
else. At the moment we do that, we'll be breaking ABI compatibility.

I would actually prefer if we could get rid of those two broken
descriptors on some release, and to re-add them only when they're
actually working.

That depends on the usecase. For applications like dvbv5 tools,
that only use the library to scan channels and tune, there's no need.

However, if the application wants to do something more fancy, like
parsing the program guide, it will need to look inside the EIT
descriptors, where the program guide is stored.

There's also a feature that Andr√© is working to add to tvdaemon and to
the libdvbv5 library. He can comment a little more about his needs.

As far of what I understood, he wants to use the library to produce
a MPEG-TS, probably to generate what is called MPEG remux.

MPEG remux means to be able to create a new MPEG-TS with a subset of 
the elementary streams that are found on the original stream. In other
words, imagine a stream with 6 independent channels multiplexed inside a 
single MPEG-TS (this is common on DVB-C). A remuxed MPEG could contain
just one of those channels.

In order to be able to create a MPEG-TS, the application need to
be able to handle all tables/descriptors required to produce it.

Mauro
