Yes, this driver supports all the functionalities which are supported
by radio-wl1273.c [But our driver is on UART while wl1273 is based on
i2c..]

NOTE: V4L2 FM driver depend upon an underlying TI_ST driver which is
the core transport driver [based on UART, it is a ldisc driver]

Updates to TI-ST driver happen on linux-next tree on kernel.org and
are planned to be released in 2.6.39.

Since your tree
@[http://git.linuxtv.org/media_tree.git?a=shortlog;h=refs/heads/staging/for_v2.6.39]

lags behind the linux-next tree, the recent updates to TI-ST driver
are missing on your tree.

Unfortunately these would cause a build failure for the V4L2 driver,
since the APIs have changed on the TI-ST driver.


So, I will provide you one patch to make the present driver to work
with latest ST driver once your tree moves to 2.6.38-rc6+ kernel.
