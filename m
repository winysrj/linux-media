The media controller is an API used (among other things) to set the links. You 
still need to call it from userspace. That won't happen magically. The 
userspace component that sets up the links and configures the formats, be it a 
GStreamer element, a libv4l plugin, or something else, can as well setup the 
standard on the TVP5146 subdev.

At then end of the OMAP3 ISP pipeline video data has long lost its analog 
roots. I don't think standards make sense there.
