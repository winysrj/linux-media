If this is the case, then it ought not to be terribly difficult to write a 
basic driver. If you wanted still camera support, with which I have a bit 
more experience than with streaming support, I would say it would take me 
about a week or so. The real obstacle is proprietary data compression 
which is usually totally undocumented, as others have already said.

Of course, I said above "basic" driver. That does not include things like 
color balance, contrast, or brightness controls. Such would probably take 
a little bit longer.
