Within themselves - for example a regulator consumer asks for a given
supply on the device in terms of the supply names the device has.

Ah, that sounds like the API is missing a component to link things
together.  But I could be wrong.  What I would expect to see is that the
consumer says "I want the PHY called X" and the PHY driver says "I
provide this set of PHYs" with a layer in between that plugs those
together.  This would normally involve talking about the parent device
rather than the PHY itself.

I think you're not really talking about the lookup API at all here but
rather about one way in which the matching code can be written.  What
everything *really* wants to do is work in terms of resources namespaced
within struct devices since every bit of hardware in the system should
have one of those it can use and if you have a struct device you can do
useful things like call dev_printk() and find the device tree data to do
device tree based lookups.

Unfortunately for a number of buses even when statically registering the
struct device doesn't get allocated until the device is probed so what
everyone fell back on doing was using dev_name() in cases where the
struct device wasn't there yet, or just always using it for consistency
since for most of the affected buses dev_name() is fixed for human
interface reasons.  I think this is the issue you're concerned about
here since if the dev_name() is dynamically allocated this breaks down.
This only affects board files, DT and ACPI can both use their own data
structures to do the mapping.

I had thought you were talking about picking the names that the
consumers use (which isn't actually that big a deal, it's just a bit
annoying for the clock API).

No, in practice passing around the pointer gets tricky if you're using
something other than board files (or even are doing any kind of dynamic
stuff with board files) since the two devices need to find each other
and if you're using platform data then the code doing the matching has
to know about the platform data for every device it might need to match
which is just miserable.

Something would need to do something like allocate the PHY objects and
then arrange for them to be passed to both provider and consumer devices
prior to those being registered, knowing where to place the pointers in
the platform data for each device.  This is straightforward with board
files but not otherwise, people have tried this before.

I think the underlying issue here is that we don't have a good enough
general way for board files (or other C code but mostly them) to talk
about devices prior to their being registered - rather than have the
pointer you're talking about be the PHY object itself have the pointer
be something which allows us to match the struct device when it's
created.  This should be transparent to drivers and would be usable by
all the existing APIs.
