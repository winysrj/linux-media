Hi list,

as a follow-up to 
http://www.spinics.net/lists/linux-media/msg30930.html: I have the "Odys 
Easy TV Model X820001" 
(http://www.dooyoo.co.uk/tv-cards/odys-easy-tv-dvbt-usb-box/) which also 
is a dib3000mb device but it isn't mentioned yet in the list at 
http://www.linuxtv.org/wiki/index.php/DVB-T_USB_Devices/Full.

I recently updated from Debian Lenny (where the box worked flawlessly) 
to Squeeze and now I don't get any station tuned.

Is there any fix in sight?

Thanks and regards,
Patrick
