hi list,

i just bought the above mentioned DVBT-Stick after my terratec prodigy died 
(from overheating i guess).
I remembered sth. about digivox being supported, but i found only drivers for 
the "Digivox Mini II 3.0" which don't seem to recognize that stick at all.

Anyone got that card working? If it is just the usb-id which is missing, 
how /where would i add that to the source?

greetings,
strowi
