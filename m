I lost part of the thread, but a quick search via the Internet showed that you're using
the input tools to work with a Remote Controller, right? Are you using a vanilla
kernel, or are you using the media_build backports? There are some distros that are
using those backports also like Fedora 14.

In the latter case, I found the reason why the backports were not working and I fixed
it a couple days ago:
	http://git.linuxtv.org/media_build.git?a=commit;h=b83dc3e49d90527d8e1016d09e06f4842a6a847a

The issue is simple, and it is related on how the input.c used to handle EVIOSGKEYCODE.
Basically, before allowing you to change a key, it used to call EVIOCGKEYCODE to check
it that key exists. However, when you're creating a new association, the key didn't
exist, and, to be strict with input rules, EVIOCGKEYCODE should return -EINVAL.
To circumvent that behaviour, old versions were returning 0, and associating unmapped
scancodes to KEY_RESERVED. We used this workaround for a few kernel versions, while
we were discussing the improvements so support larger scancodes.

Yet, on all vanilla kernels, changing the keycode association works fine.

However, the backport patch at media_build were not taking this workaround into account,
and were just returning -EINVAL. So, the backported media drivers stopped allowing
some keytable changes. The patch above fixes it.

Cheers,
Mauro
