I'm still in process of applying the pending patches. Due to patchwork.kernel.org
troubles (including the loss of about 270 patches from its SQL database only 
recovered yesterday[1]), I have a long backlog. So, I'm gradually applying the remaing
stuff. It will take some time though, and it will depend on patchwork mood, but I intend
to spend some time during this weekend to minimize the backlog.


Cheers,
Mauro

[1] The recover lost the email's body/SOB, so I've wrote a script to use my email
queue to get the data, using patchwork just to mark what patches were already
processed. This increses the time I have to spend on each patch, as I need to run
a script to match the patchwork patch with the patch ID inside my email queue.
