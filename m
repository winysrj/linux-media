Hi Hans,

The JPEG compression quality of the sn9c20x is 95%. That's why the
frames are so big. Then, if the quality is not settable, I wonder why
to use the JPEG format.

BTW, I wonder also about the SN9C20X_I420: this format asks for a
buffer greater than the native image. So, as these webcams are USB 2.0,
shouldn't it be simpler to have only Bayer in the driver?
