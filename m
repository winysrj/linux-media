That's my problem, the DVB audio/video API is deprecated, apparently
there is no other new API available which provides the same functionality.
At least for me it is not obvious, how that should work.

OK, that confirms my opinion. There is no common implementation
in DRM for video decoders.
As application developer I want to see a uniform new API, as it is
really painful
to support different APIs for the same functionality in different hardware.
Will video decoding be handled by DRM or V4L2 in the future?

Agreed. But you brought up the topic of FF hardware, that would need
to "touch a lot inside the DVB API", which IMHO need not necessarily
be the case.

I also agree with that. But it looks for me, as the same problem
is getting worse. We still have, and apparently even get more
overlapping new APIs. This is not something an application developer
wants to see.

Yes, it is clear, what is possible with the different APIs.
But sometimes I only  get the wrong API implementation,
see below.

"Zero-copy" (on the CPU) does not mean no overhead. If I have to save
and reread the scaled image, additional bus traffic is generated which
leads to unnecessary power consumption and slows down other bus
transfers. If the scaled image is directly handed over to the HDMI output,
this can be avoided.

Yes, OK, also for video input we need several APIs, not only MC.

Really? Why it is called media, if it does not handle at least
video and audio?
As application developer I would wish to have an API, which
is able to handle audio and video together, e.g. for HDMI
output.

Who should write that? I think it's a question for you as media maintainer.

I would like to understand:
How is that, what DVB audio/video/osd provide (for "old hardware"),
supposed to work with modern APIs on modern hardware?

My use case (as with the "old" S2-6400 card [1]) is HDMI output of
frame-synchronous audio and video (DVB transport stream) plus overlay
graphics, preferably with independent scaling for video and overlay.
Video and audio format changes must be handled frame-by-frame on
the fly, as DVB broadcasters sometimes like to switch formats for
advertising and then back for the movie.

I want that to work on modern FF hardware: e.g. imx
(imx6q), sunxi (e.g. Allwinner H5), meson (meson-gxbb S905), rockchip,...
The multimedia-API (or combination of APIs) should hide the hardware
differences from the userspace application (this is the purpose of kernel
APIs), especially I should not be forced to use different APIs for similar
hardware, as , e.g., usually DRM does the scaling, sometimes I have
to use a media mem2mem scaler, because it is implemented that way
(e.g. for imx6q) and not in DRM, what would be the preferred variant
for my use case. Similar for video decoders: DRM/V4L2.

>From all the different drivers for the mentioned SoCs for me it is not
obvious, what the global strategy in linux/linux-media is to support my
use case (hardware of the mentioned SoCs supports all that).
Which API (-combination) is designated to support this case on
all available modern hardware? Which API I should select in my
userspace application, in which direction should I (and hopefully
others) try to improve the existing (multi-)media kernel drivers in
linux, to get closer to common support for that classic multimedia
use case?

Some explanation or documentation for this would really be appreciated.

Soeren
