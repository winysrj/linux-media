AFAIK, only saa7134 have a good suspend/resume code [1]. You may be watching TV,
do a suspend and waking the hardware again, and you'll keep seeing the same
channel (I tested it some time ago, when the proper suspend code were added,
on analog mode, with alsa enabled). Other drivers can suspend/resume, but
they won't properly restore the video registers, so, you'll see artifacts when
it returns.

So, yes, you're right: before any suspend/resume code on those drivers, we
first need to add some code to properly handle kernel threads and work queues
during suspend, and to restore all the registers to a sane state at resume,
before implementing IR wakeup on them.

In the case of mceusb, as there is already an userspace code for it on lirc,
it would probably not be that hard to make this feature to work with ir-core.

[1] Yet, none of the in-hardware decoders allow resume, AFAIK. With a software
decoder, the IR IRQ might be used to wake, but this means that everything,
even a glitch, would wake the hardware, so this won't work neither.
