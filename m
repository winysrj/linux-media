Fine with me. Clemens, any opinion on that ?

Should this be clarified by using V4L2_SUBDEV instead then ? What about ALSA 
entities, should they use MEDIA_ENTITY_TYPE_ALSA_* ?

My understanding is that EXT_BROADCAST really represents the TV tuners, ..., 
not the connector they connect to. Some (all ?) of them are definitely V4L2 
subdevs.
