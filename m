Please reply to this poll if you haven't done so yet. I only count clear 
yes/no answers, so if you replied earlier to this in order to discuss a 
point then I haven't counted that.

Currently it's 16 yes and 2 no votes, but I'd really like to see some more 
input. I want to post the final results on Sunday.

Regards,

	Hans
