Hi. I would be happy to hear if anyone has tried both the NOVA-TD and the
NOVA-T. The NOVA-T has always worked perfectly here but I would like to know
if the -TD will do the job of two NOVA-T's. And there also seems to be a new
version out with two small antenna connectors instead of the previous
configuration. Anyone tried it? Does it come with an antenna adaptor cable?

Thankful for any info.
