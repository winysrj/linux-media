Dearest ,

I am constrained to contact you because of the maltreatment which I am 
receiving from my step mother. She planned to take away all my late 
father's treasury and properties from me since the  unexpected death of 
my beloved Father ,my mother died 10years ago and I was left alone with 
my step mother to take care of me. Meanwhile I wanted to travel to 
Europe, but she hide  away my  international passport and other 
valuable documents.  Luckily she did not discover where I kept my 
father's File which contained very important documents . Now I am 
presently staying in the Refugee Mission Camp in Burkina Faso. I am 
seeking for long term relationship and investment assistance. My father 
of blessed memory deposited the sum of US$ 27.5 Million in one bank 
here in Burkina Faso with my name as the next of kin. I had contacted 
the Bank to clear the deposit but the Branch Manager told me that being 
a refugee, my status according to the local law does not authorize me 
to carry out the operation ,However, he advised me to provide a trustee 
who will stand on my behalf. I had wanted to inform my stepmother about 
this deposit but I am afraid that she will not offer me anything after 
the release of the money ,I will give you details in my next mail after 
receiving your acceptance mail to help me.

Best Regards
Miss. Maria Warlord I. Coulibaly
