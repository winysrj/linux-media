For the media drivers, we've already fixed it, at the V4L side:
-EINVAL doesn't mean that an ioctl is not supported anymore.
I think that such fix went into Kernel 3.1.

There are still two different behaviors there:
	at the V4L API: the return code is -ENOTTY;
	at the DVB API: the return code is currrently -EOPNOTSUPP.

Yeah, I know that DVB is returning the wrong code. Fixing it is on
my todo list, although with low priority, as the behavior inside the
DVB part is consistent.

On both DVB and V4L, -EINVAL now means only invalid parameters.
