Hi,

I have a display of 720P and a 8MP camera.

Do i need to capture 8MP image or an image 720P from the camera as the
i need to display it on the LCD.

Where does the scaling take place? Should i scale the image down
before i display or should i capture a smaller resolution image from
the
camera to be able to display on the LCD.

thanks for your help.

Thanks,
ryan
