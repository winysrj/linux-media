It depends on what your needs are and whether you already own the
device.  If you own an older version of the board already, it may or
may not work depending on which board you ended up with (if you send
the USB ID, I can tell you the status in terms of support).  If you
haven't bought it yet, then the currently shipping version of this
product is not supported (I'm actively working on the support).  Also,
even once I have added the support, it will only be for the digital
part of the card, with no plans at this time to do the analog support.

Cheers,

Devin
