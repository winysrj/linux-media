Thanks. Now I found why I was failing earlier - it was due to USB2.0 
ExpressCard adapter I was using... :-( After I plugged it to Linux 
laptop native ExpressCard slot it attachs demod. Tuning is still always 
failing with filter timeouts. I even opened my box, there is DiBcom 
7700C1-ACXXa-G and Microtune MT2266F. I will hack that more later.

regards
Antti
