I have 3 patches pending which aren't in your list. I can see them in
patchwork:

http://patchwork.kernel.org/patch/79755/
http://patchwork.kernel.org/patch/79754/
http://patchwork.kernel.org/patch/77349/

The former two are in "Accepted" state, and actually I received an
e-mail telling me they had been accepted, however I can't see them in
the hg repository. So where are they?

The latter is in "Not Applicable" state, and I have no idea what it
means. The patch is really simple and I see no formatting issue. Should
I just resend it?

Thanks,
