Subject: [RFCv2 0/8] [media] si4713 DT binding

Hi,

This is the RFCv2 patchset adding DT support to the si4713
radio transmitter i2c driver. The changes can be summarized
as follows:

 * Move regulator information back into the driver. The
   regulators needed are documented in the chip and have
   nothing to do with boarddata. Instead devm_regulator_get_optional
   is used and errors are handled quite loosely now. Maybe the USB
   driver should provide dummy regulators.
 * GPIO handling is updated to gpiod consumer interface, resulting
   in a driver cleanup and easy DT handling
 * The driver is updated to use managed resources wherever possible

So much about the nice stuff. But there is also

 * Instantiation of the platform device from the i2c (sub-)device. Since DT
   is not supposed to contain linuxisms the device is a simple i2c node
   resulting in the i2c probe function being called. Thus registering the main
   v4l device must happen from there.

Tested:
 * Compilation on torvalds/linux.git:master (based on 52d589a)
 * Booting in DT mode
 * Some simply driver queries using v4l2-ctl

Not tested:
 * The USB driver, since I do not own the USB dongle
 * The legacy platform code (only DT boot has been tested).
   (The legacy platform code is supposed to removed in the near future anyways)

Changes since RFCv1 (requested by Hans Verkuil):
 - splitted the patchset into more patches
 - replaced dev_info with dev_dbg for missing regulators
 - check for ENOSYS value from devm_gpiod_get (disabled GPIOLIB)
