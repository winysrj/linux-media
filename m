Yes, my proposal is that.

mm/memory_hotplug.c::offline_pages() does

	1. disallow new allocation of memory in [start_pfn...end_pfn)
	2. move all LRU pages to other regions than [start_pfn...end_pfn)
	3. finally, mark all pages as PG_reserved (see __offline_isolated_pages())

What's required for cma will be
	a. remove _section_ limitation, which is done as BUG_ON().
	b. replace 'step 3' with cma code.

Maybe you can do similar just using compaction logic. The biggest difference will
be 'step 1'.

Hmm, ok, use-case dependent and it's a job of a driver.
