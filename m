Hello,

I have a pcHDTV 3000 card [0], on a 3.10-rc6 kernel. Every so often,
it stops working [1]. When I try to reload cx88_dvb, module loads, but
init errors out because some sysfs file is already there [2]. Removing
more of the video-related modules doesn't seem to help (at least not
once this happens). Any ideas? It seems like this has been asked
before [3] but no response. The files it fails to re-create are:

[334698.061395] sysfs: cannot create duplicate filename
'/devices/pci0000:00/0000:00:1e.0/0000:09:00.2/dvb/dvb0.frontend0'
[334698.062420] sysfs: cannot create duplicate filename
'/devices/pci0000:00/0000:00:1e.0/0000:09:00.2/dvb/dvb0.demux0'
[334698.062881] sysfs: cannot create duplicate filename
'/devices/pci0000:00/0000:00:1e.0/0000:09:00.2/dvb/dvb0.dvr0'

And the other warnings are just fallout from that. After removing all
of the video-related modules, that dvb directory is still there:

# ls /sys/devices/pci0000:00/0000:00:1e.0/0000:09:00.2/dvb
dvb0.demux0  dvb0.dvr0  dvb0.frontend0
# ls -l /sys/devices/pci0000:00/0000:00:1e.0/0000:09:00.2/dvb/dvb0.demux0
total 0
-r--r--r-- 1 root root 4096 Jun 30 23:03 dev
lrwxrwxrwx 1 root root    0 Jun 30 23:03 device -> ../../../0000:09:00.2
drwxr-xr-x 2 root root    0 Jun 27 01:43 power
lrwxrwxrwx 1 root root    0 Jun 27 01:43 subsystem ->
../../../../../../class/dvb
-rw-r--r-- 1 root root 4096 Jun 26 21:43 uevent

Note that subsystem there is a broken link, /sys/class/dvb no longer
exists since I've unloaded those modules.

Let me know if there's anything I should try. I'm pretty sure I can
reproduce this at will (just reloading the cx88_dvb module should do
it, even if the card isn't wedged) but I haven't tried it.

Thanks,
