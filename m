Yes, it came 3 days before your own message: 
http://marc.info/?l=linux-video&m=123419514523631&w=2

Previous to that, Robert had expressed interest, as read here:
http://marc.info/?l=linux-video&m=122459807631633&w=2  . But if you
continue reading through the first thread, you will see that he has
evidently pursued a different route.

So, it would rather appear that unless someone is quietly (i.e. hasn't
announced and/or prefers not to announce) working on analog support for
the au0828 IC, I wouldn't count on anything forthcoming.   Being that
case, I would encourage anyone who is really interested in such support
to consider leading the pursuit to that end.
