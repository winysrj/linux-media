Thank you for organizing this. I'll be in Düsseldorf the whole week for ELCE 
and LPC, and I will need to attend the IOMMU microconference at LPC on Friday 
the 17th in the afternoon. Apart from that I'm interested and happy to 
participate in the media mini-summit.

Regarding topics, I'm thinking about runtime reconfiguration of pipelines, but 
it's a bit early to tell. I have customer demand for that, but no exact 
schedule yet, so it might be too early.
