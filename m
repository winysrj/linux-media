Hi! I learned that you can help with the driver for AverTV Studio 509 UA.
>From what I know about him: TV part works with the option card = 102
(AverTV Studio 507) tuner = 38 (PHILIPS_FM1216ME_MK3) but FM radio is
made on tea5764hn and these options will not work (the driver has been
written belavenuto@gmail.com).
