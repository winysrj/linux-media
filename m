Hello Thomas,

the assumption is good then.

Latest revisions of the Lifeview cards do switch to radio mode with
gpio21 high and let it low for TV. (it was the other way round
previously)

I was just wondering, if it might have radio support at all, since
gpio21 is not set in the m$ gpio mask and you say it does not come with
radio software.

The gpio18 and 16 can trigger IRQs and are usually in use on such
remotes for the button up/down signal and related IRQ sampling.

All saa7133/35/31e with tda8275ac and radio IF support use a special
7.5MHz ceramic filter, usually a huge well visible part in blue or
orange color, but on latest designs they are hard to identify, since
they might appear as SMD discrets now too.

The switch to this filter is often related to a an antenna connector RF
input switch triggered by the same gpio, but not necessarily. All sort
of combinations do exist.

Anyway, we demodulate the radio IF from such tuners on the
saa7133/35/31e on the saa chip and do also the stereo separation and
detection there. Hartmut added the needed code in saa7134-tvaudio and it
is valid for all tuner=54.

To achieve that, you need to use amux = TV for radio and likely also
some gpio is involved for the RF routing.

Cheers,
Hermann
