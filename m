I have taken the liberty to put you on Cc: for the i.MX drm series that
I'd like to use these helpers in. The patch in question is
"[RFC PATCH v3 3/9] staging: imx-drm-core: Use OF graph to find
components and connections between encoder and crtcs"
(http://www.spinics.net/lists/arm-kernel/msg308542.html).
It currently uses local copies (s/of_graph/imx_drm_of/) of the
get_next_endpoint, get_remote_port, and get_remote_port_parent
functions to obtain all necessary components for the componentized
imx-drm device, and to map the connections between crtcs (display
interface ports) and encoders.

regards
Philipp
