I bought a KAIOMY ISDB-T Hybrid USB Dongle Receiver to use with my
Dell Inspiron 15 Laptop under Ubuntu 11.04 Linux. But I connect it in
the USB port and it doesn't recognises it. The kernel version I am
using is the 2.6.38-8-generic. I opened the menuconfig of the kernel
and I could saw that all modules in the especific section "Device
Drivers --> Multimedia support --> DVB/ATSC Adapters" are all set to
<M>. I was thinking that the driver v2l already was buit in this
modules. But when I connected the device in the USB port I got the
following autputs to the lsusb and dmesg commands in the console:

I guess that the device pointed is Device 014, Prolink Microsystems Corp.

Here the output of the last lines of "dmesg":

I am not an expert in linux but I can't see anything that could
indicate that it recognised it in dmesg. I would like if you may help
me in order I could use this device in Linux (in windows 7 it is
working properly...).
I would like you send me the routine that I must to follow (step by
step, please because I am not an expert as I already said).
Hopping you help me I would like to tanks in advantage.

Sincerely

Antonio Carlos Ribeiro Nogueira
