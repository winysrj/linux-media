And thinking about the initial 0x0 width/height for the output queue:

that too is an exception, although less of a problem than the EACCES behavior.

It should be fine for an application to set width/height to 0 when calling
S_FMT for the output queue of the decoder, but I would also prefer that it is
just replaced by the driver with some default resolution. It really doesn't
matter in practice, since you will wait for the SOURCE_CHANGE event regardless.

Only then do you start to configure the CAPTURE queue.

Using 0x0 and EACCES looks good on paper, but in the code it is a hassle and
I'm not convinced there is any benefit.

I like generic APIs and no where else do we ever return a 0 value for width
or height, except in this corner case. It's just awkward.
