ivtvfb is stealing the decoders' OSD for use as a framebuffer.
The decoder video output memory doesn't overlap the decoder OSD memory,
but there is a functional overlap.  ivtv driver video output device
nodes can manipulate the OSD that ivtvfb is stealing.

It would be a dumb thing for the user to want to use ivtvfb, and to also
manipulate the OSD via the video output device nodes at the same time,
for anything other than setting up the TV video standard.  However the
current ivtv driver code doesn't prevent the OSD from being manipulated
by the video output device nodes when ivtvfb is in use.
