If you get a highmem page, because the cache is VIPT, that page might 
still be cached even if it wasn't mapped.  With a VIVT cache we must 
flush the cache whenever a highmem page is unmapped.  There is no such 
restriction with VIPT i.e. ARMv6 and above.  Therefore to make sure the 
highmem page you get doesn't have cache lines associated to it, you must 
first map it cacheable, then perform cache invalidation on it, and 
eventually remap it as non-cacheable.  This is necessary because there 
is no way to perform cache maintenance on L1 cache using physical 
addresses unfortunately.  See commit 7e5a69e83b for an example of what 
this entails (fortunately commit 3e4d3af501 made things much easier and 
therefore commit 39af22a79 greatly simplified things).
