Hey,

Thanks for reviewing.

It's been hard since I haven't seen anything similar in the kernel, I originally went with tickets
since that's what ttm originally called it, and tried to kill as many references as I could
when I noticed ticket mutexes already being taken.

I'll fix up the ticket_mutex -> reservation_mutex, and mutex_reserve_* -> reserve_mutex_*

 I didn't intend for drivers to use the new calls directly, but rather through a wrapper,
for example by ttm_eu_reserve_buffers in drivers/gpu/drm/ttm/ttm_execbuf_util.c

I didn't study cs, but judging from your phrasing I guess you mean you want me to call it transaction_mutexes instead?

My head too, evil priority stuff!

Hacky but pragmatical workaround for now: use a real mutex around all the reserve_mutex_lock* calls instead of a virtual lock.
It can be unlocked as soon as all locks have been taken, before any actual work is done.

It only slightly kills the point of having a reservation in the first place, but at least it won't break completely -rt completely for now.
