Hi,

im trying to get a Hauppauge HVR-4400 working on a Debian squeeze. It seems to 
be unsopported yet. Is there any driver which i don't know about?

If not i would really like to help getting it supported (information, 
testing,...)

Some information i get from the card:

Hauppauge HVR-4400 ( should be some kind of 4000 but with a pci-express 
interface )

The driver trying to access the card is cx23885 and it does not know the card 
and therefore falls back to generic.

If i force the driver to use the card HVR-1800 i get the following kernel log:
( Maybe this info is not reliable?! )
