I was wondering in general if “!PageBuddy(page) && !page_count(page)” means
page is on PCP.  From what I've seen in page_isolate.c it seems to be the case.

If I'm not mistaken, page_count() != 0 means the page is allocated.  I can see
the following scenarios which can lead to page being allocated in when
test_pages_isolated() is called:

1. The page failed to migrate.  In this case however, the code would abort earlier.

2. The page was migrated but then allocated.  This is not possible since
    migrated pages are freed which puts the page on MIGRATE_ISOLATE freelist which
    guarantees that the page will not be migrated.

3. The page was removed from PCP list but with migratetype == MIGRATE_CMA.  This
    is something the first patch in the series as well as the commit I've mentioned tries
    to address so hopefully it won't be an issue any more.

4. The page was allocated from PCP list.  This may happen because draining of PCP
    list happens after IRQs are enabled in set_migratetype_isolate().  I don't have
    a solution for that just yet.  One is to alter update_pcp_isolate_block() to
    remove page from the PCP list.  I haven't looked at specifics of how to implement
    this just yet.

Yep, I've pushed new content to my branch (git://github.com/mina86/linux-2.6.git cma)
and will try to get Marek to test it some time soon (I'm currently swamped with
non-Linux related work myself).
