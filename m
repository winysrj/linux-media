Hmm... I found it easy to do it ;)

The fact that, currently, on all devices, The first bus has the eeprom[1]
and that all other devices are on the secondary bus makes easy to properly
implementing it with just a few changes. Ok, if/when we start to see
devices mixed, we'll need to add a more complex logic, but for now,
it can be simply done, and em28xx i2c scan can check both buses, with
may help future development.

I'll post some patches tomorrow after testing.

[1] That could be a hardware requirement, as it makes easier for the
device to seek for eeprom data.

Mauro
