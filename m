Hi,

This series add V4L2_FIELD_ALTERNATE support to the rcar-vin driver and 
changes the field mode reported by adv7180 from V4L2_FIELD_INTERLACED to 
V4L2_FIELD_ALTERNATE.

The change field mode reported by adv7180 was first done by Steve 
Longerbeam (https://lkml.org/lkml/2016/7/23/107), I have keept and 
reworked Steves patch to report V4L2_FIELD_ALTERNATE instead of 
V4L2_FIELD_SEQ_{TB,BT}, after discussions on #v4l this seems more
correct.

The rcar-vin changes contains some bug fixes needed to enable 
V4L2_FIELD_ALTERNATE.

All work is based on top of media-next and is tested on Koelsch.

This series touch two drivers which is not a good thing. But I could not 
figure out a good way to post them separately since if the adv7180 parts 
where too be merged before the rcar-vin changes the driver would stop to 
work on the Koelsch. If some one wants this series split in two let me 
know.

Niklas SÃ¶derlund (5):
  media: rcar-vin: allow field to be changed
  media: rcar-vin: fix bug in scaling
  media: rcar-vin: fix height for TOP and BOTTOM fields
  media: rcar-vin: add support for V4L2_FIELD_ALTERNATE
  media: adv7180: fill in mbus format in set_fmt

Steve Longerbeam (1):
  media: adv7180: fix field type
