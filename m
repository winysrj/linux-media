Hi Guennadi,
Thanks for your review time.
I only tried to get the driver really working, not only looking good ;).

Hmm, let me think about it.

I was sure the "ready" pointer was essential for both paths. However, things 
tend to change as more and more optimizations / cleanups are applied, so I 
have to verify it again.

You are right. My approach was probably more adequate at development time, 
when I was trying to aviod error-prone code duplication. As soon as both 
paths get stable, they can be split for better readability. I'll take care of 
this.

OK.

OK.
Since I always tend to optimise out redundant includes of header files that 
are otherwise included indirectly, please verify if there are more of them 
that you would prefere included explicitly.

OK.
My intention was to get it indented, and now I see it works like this even if 
not enclosed with if-endif.
Will drop the if-endif if the compile time SG option survives.

OK.
My only reason for defines here was thees numbers being used more than once.

Exactly. Both dma-contig and dma-sg paths relay on this hardware feature, 
making use of this "ready" pointing to a not yet active but already 
dma-preprogrammed videobuf.

The reason is my bad experience with my hardware audio interface. For my 
rationale regarding OMAP McBSP register caching, please look at this commit:
http://git.kernel.org/?p=linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux-2.6.git;a=commitdiff;h=96fbd74551e9cae8fd5e9cb62a0a19336a3064fa
or the foregoing discussions (links both to my initial and final submitions):
http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.linux.alsa.devel/65675
http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.linux.ports.arm.omap/29708

However, I haven't noticed any similiar flaws in camera interface yet, so if 
you think that caching would not be helpful in any possible future (context 
save/restore) enhancements here, then I can drop it.

I read the CTRLCLOCK from the hardware in omap1_cam_add_device() for one 
reason: the cache is (can be) not initialized (written with the register 
copy) yet, and there are reserved bits that I'm trying to keep untouched.

The read from the hardware in omap1_cam_remove_device() is not intentional and 
should be replaced with cache read if we don't drop register caching.

Other than that, reads from cache are used throughout other functions, I 
believe.

> Don't you have to update the cache on a direct read?

If I do it unconditionally, I'd loose the read error prevention function of 
register caching idea.

OK, I'll review and rearrange all similiar constructs.

Right. What you think is better, drop it, or replace with BUG_ON(mode & 
RAZ_FIFO)?

I've introduced this way of videobuf handling after learning, form the 
Documentation/video4linux/videobuf, what the first step of filling a buffer 
should be:

"- Obtain the next available buffer and make sure that somebody is actually
   waiting for it."

Since I had no idea how I could implement it, I decided to do it a bit 
differently: start filling a buffer unconditionally, then drop its contents 
if not awaited by any user when done.

OK, I'll correct it.

Self comment: this construct occured to not satisfy "checkpatch --strict". I'm 
going to correct all similiar cases.

If you think I don't have to follow the above mentioned requirement for not 
servicing a buffer unless someone is waiting for it, then yes, I'll drop 
these overcomplicated bits. Please confirm.

In short: in case of any error, I assume not being able to ensure that next 
frame still starts at next videobuf start, that's why I restart capture.

start_capture() doesn't actually start anything, only initializes it. After 
FIFO reset, the hardware stays idle until first frame start (as indicated by 
both VSYNC and HSYNC active), then starts filling its FIFO on LCLK edges 
selected with POLCLK and requesting DMA automatically every THRESHOLD_LEVEL 
words.

No.
This interrupt occures on every frame end. By this moment, DMA, that is set up 
to restart automatically on every DMA block end, should already be waiting 
for first data to put into the first sgbuf area of the next sglist, pointed 
out by the DMA working registers, and the second sgbuf from this list should 
already be entered by the dma_isr() into the DMA programming registers, ready 
for DMA auto restart on current sgbuf (DMA block) end.

I'm not absolutely sure, but I think I had already tried without it and it 
looked like FIFO didn't work. Will recheck.

I'm not sure if I understand what you mean. Should I drop these assignments? 
Or correct them? If yes, how they should be calculated?

In Documentation/video4linux/soc-camera.txt, you say:
"The core updates these fields upon successful completion of a .s_fmt() call, 
but if these fields change elsewhere, e.g., during .s_crop() processing, the 
host driver is responsible for updating them."

I thought this is the case we're dealing with here.

With my, maybe weird, try_fmt() implementation, I think I can be sure here 
that the geometry is not DMA aligned, unless a user can request a different 
geometry than she obtained from try_fmt(), that I assumed should not happen.

Maybe the above is not clear enough: ret == 1 means that what we got from the 
sensor is already aligned. If not, we keep processing.

Not being able to negotiate a DMA aligned geometry with the sensor - would it 
be weird enough?

The sensor kept previously returend (not aligned) values (stored in mf), not 
those DMA aligned (stored under pix).

Let me explain how it is all supposed to work:

try_fmt():
1. DMA align a user requested frame geometry.
2. Let the sensor adjust it to its capabilities.
3. If the sensor didn't change the (DMA aligned) geometry, we are done.
4. Otherwise, DMA align it again.
5. If no DMA alignment was necessary on the sensor proposed geometry, we are 
   done as well.
6. Otherwise, check if we still get the same (not aligned) geometry from the 
   sensor if now asking for its DMA alignment result.
7. If the now returned sensor geometry is different from what we got before, 
   we can either restart from 3 (how many iterations?) or fail, I believe.
8. Otherwise, we can accept the sensor geometry that is not DMA aligned, but 
   should return the DMA aligned one, not the sensor provided. We believe to 
   crop the sensor geometry to DMA aligned one during S_FMT.

set_fmt():
1. Since we always return DMA aligned geometry from try_fmt(), expecting it 
   being accepted by a user, we start from checking if what user have 
   requested now is DMA aligned or not.
2. If not DMA aligned, we fail.
   Should we be more polite and try to do our best to accept a geometry that 
   differs from what our try_fmt() could ever return?
3. If DMA aligned, then OK, let the sensor adjust it to its capabilities.
4. If the sensor didn't change the (DMA aligned) geometry, we are done.
5. Otherwise, we assume the sensor returned geometry is not DMA aligned (if it 
   were, we would accept it during try_fmt() before), so it has to be cropped.
   Should we rather retry with S_FMT instead of cropping?
6. If crop gives the geometry requested, we are done.
7. Otherwise, we fail.
   Should we be more cooperative here and accept any valid (ie. DMA aligned) 
   crop result?
