Great, good to know that I'm not the only one that noticed this behavior.

I second you on that, we need someone who knows the ISP better than we
do. I have to fix this anyway, so it is better if I can do it the
right way and the code gos upstream, so we don't have to internally
maintain a separate patch-set and forward port for each kernel release
we do.
