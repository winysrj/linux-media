Hi Mauro

There go the 3 fixes, that popped up (at least in my INBOX;-)) last 
weekend. Unfortunately they'll break your renaming work, not sure if you 
manage to get git to automatically merge the stuff. In fact, I so far 
haven't been able to do anything like "git log" across those directory 
structure revamping patches, which makes work a bit more difficult, but 
well... As for stable - Frank has marked his patch for stable, so, maybe 
it's important for him:-) In any case, the bug, that that patch fixes 
isn't a regression, it has been in the driver since the first version of 
that code. The other two patches aren't too critical either, so, use your 
judgement, I guess.

The following changes since commit 56d27adcb536b7430d5f8a6240df8ad261eb00bd:

  Merge git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/cmetcalf/linux-tile (2012-09-24 16:17:17 -0700)
