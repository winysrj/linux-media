Subject: [PATCH] dma-buf: Expose buffer size to userspace
Date: Mon,  5 Aug 2013 16:22:00 +1000
Message-Id: <1375683720-4748-1-git-send-email-christopher.halse.rogers@canonical.com>
Sender: linux-media-owner@vger.kernel.org
List-ID: <linux-media.vger.kernel.org>

Each dma-buf has an associated size and it's reasonable for userspace
to want to know what it is.

Since userspace already has an fd, expose the size using the
size = lseek(fd, SEEK_END, 0); lseek(fd, SEEK_CUR, 0);
idiom.

I've run into a point in the radeon DRM userspace where I need the
size of a dma-buf. I could add a radeon-specific mechanism to get that,
but this seems like something that would be more generally useful.

I'm not entirely sure about supporting both SEEK_END and SEEK_CUR; this
is somewhat of an abuse of lseek, as seeking obviously doesn't make sense.
It's the obivous idiom for getting the size of what's on the other end of a
file descriptor, though.

I didn't notice anywhere to document this; Documentation/dma-buf-api didn't
seem like the right place. Is there somewhere I've overlooked?
