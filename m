Hi Antonio,

Yes, V4L2_CID_EXPOSURE_AUTO is of class V4L2_CTRL_CLASS_CAMERA, and, as
the associated menu shows, it is not suitable for webcams.

In the webcam world, the autoexposure is often the same as the
autogain: in the knee algorithm
(http://81.209.78.62:8080/docs/LowLightOptimization.html - also look at
gspca/sonixb.c), both exposure and gain are concerned. The cases where
a user wants only autoexposure (fixed gain) or autogain (fixed
exposure) are rare. If you want people to be able to do that, you
should add a new webcam control, V4L2_CID_AUTOEXPOSURE, and also add it
to each driver which implements the knee algorithm, and handle the three
cases, autogain only, autoexposure only and knee.

Then, looking about your implementation of vidioc_s_ext_ctrls, I found
it was a bit simple: setting many controls is atomic, i.e., if any
error occurs at some point, the previous controls should be reset to
their original values. Same about vidioc_g_ext_ctrls: the mutex must be
taken only once for the values do not change. You also do not check if
the controls are in a same control class. Anyway, are these ioctl's
needed?

Regards.
