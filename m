I couldn't reproduce what I was seeing when I did patch v2 series
work. What I noticed was that I was seeing a few too many green screens
and I had to re-tune xawtv when the timeout code is in place. My
thinking was that this timeout handling could be introducing blank
green frames when there is no need. However, I can't reproduce the
problem on 3.19-rc4 base which is what I am using to test the changes
to the patch series. Hence, I am not positive if the timeout code
indeed was doing anything bad.

I am seeing tvtime hangs without the timeout. I am fine with this
patch not going. It does make the code cleaner and also reduces
buffer handling during streaming. However, there is a clear regression
to tvtime.

thanks,
