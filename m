Sorry, maybe I phrased my request as a solution which is not what I
intended. I was unaware of your agreements with NXP. I see you added how
much money has been donated to your post. That's more than enough of a
status indicator for me.

Possibly could you roughly estimate how much more work is required and
present it in the same manner?

I want to you know that I do support this project and have just contributed
- both as a thank you for your prior work and willingness to help the
community in addition to the HVR-2250 support.

Thanks,
Andrew
