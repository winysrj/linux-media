Thanks for the clarifications !

Having a "Port <id>" will be great indeed, no need to specify HDMI since
only HDMI connectors will get a CEC notifier anyway.

The issue is that port_name() returns a character, which is lame.
Would it be acceptable to introduce a :

const char *port_identifier(struct drm_i915_private *dev_priv,
			    enum port port)
{
	char *id = devm_kzalloc(dev_priv->drm->dev, 16, GFP_KERNEL);

	if (id)
		return NULL;

	snprintf("Port %c", port_name(port));

	return id;
}

and use the result of this for the cec_notifier connector name ?
