A SOB by a non-author implies that the patch got reviewed, as otherwise
such patch won't be merged, as it doesn't make sense to forward a patch
that are known to be broken.

That documentation is for submitting patches. It doesn't describe
the process used by the drivers and subsystems maintainers.

>From time to time, people discuss about the usefulness of those
non-SOB tags, but the general consensus seems that a patch should
have just one tag from the same person.

The last one was during the last KS. See what's there at the end of
this article:
	http://lwn.net/Articles/608968/

	"The session ended with Linus jumping in and saying that,
	 in the end, the Reviewed-by, Acked-by, and Cc tags all mean
	 the same thing: the person named in the tag will be copied
	 on the report if the patch turns out to be buggy. Some
	 developers use one tag, while others use a different one,
	 but there is no real difference between them.
	 The session closed with some general disagreement over the
	 meanings of the different tags â€” and no new ideas on how
	 to get more review of kernel code."

Mauro
