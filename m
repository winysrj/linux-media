Hi everyone.
     I am trying to get beetel (Indian OEM) FUN USB tv tuner card to work
on Ubuntu 10.04. The vendor is not listed on the supported hardware
wikipage.

     I suspect the card might be supported in another avatar. lsusb from:
Vendor/Product ID is 1f71:3306. Does this ring a bell?

     If not, I would like to work towards supporting it. Can someone point
me in that direction? Just started to compile the kernel to enable the V4L
modules....

Cheers,
Sriram
