Dear One in the Lord,
Life itself is a misery and nobody can tell what can be of it. Those that
can tell what can be of it are those who cannot tell us because they are far
from us (dead). If you will want to hear my story. I am the above named
person but now undergoing medical treatment for cancer now. I am married to
Dr.Ebole who worked with South Africa embassy in Malaysia for nine years
before he died in the year 2002. Well, I will only try to let you Know who
Dr.Ebole is by stating his philosophy of life. "Life is worth living only
if lived to the service of mankind" and "You make a living by what you earn,
 I have entrusted all our inheritance in your name so that you can help in
carrying our dreams.
