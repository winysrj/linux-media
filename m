So I have change the device driver to set in this register the physical address of the other endpoint (get_resource start called to other endpoint, and it is the same address which I could see in lspci -vvvv -s bus-address of the switch port, memories behind bridge), so now the endpoint has to start send writes TLP with the other endpoint address in the TLP header.

Hmm, well if I understand you correctly it sounds like, in theory, it
should work. But there could be any number of reasons why it does not.
You may need to get a hold of a PCIe analyzer to figure out what's
actually going on.
