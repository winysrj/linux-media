I agree for the case you are describing here. From what I understood
from Rob was that he is looking at something more like:

Fig 3
CPU--L1cache--L2cache--Memory--IOMMU---<iobus>--device

where the IOMMU controls one or more contexts per device, and is
shared across GPU and non-GPU devices. Here, we need to use the
dmap-mapping interface to set up the IO page table for any device
that is unable to address all of system RAM, and we can use it
for purposes like isolation of the devices. There are also cases
where using the IOMMU is not optional.

So unlike the scenario you describe, the driver cannot at the
same time control the cache (using the dma-mapping API) and
the I/O page tables (using the iommu API or some internal
functions).
