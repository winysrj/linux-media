For dma_map_single(dev, addr, size, dir), basically:

	for (a = addr; a < addr + size; a += PAGE_SIZE)
		BUG_ON(!virt_addr_valid(a));

For dma_map_page(dev, page, offset, size, dir), 'page' must be something
obtained from one of the page-based kernel allocators (so either refering
to a page in the *existing* lowmem or highmem memory) _and_ you must not
use offset/size to then point at something outside that.

So, if you take something out of the kernel's knowledge of what is memory,
you can't then use the DMA API with it.
