Here comes another one, integrated Chicony webcam 04f2:b39f, its
autosuspend makes `poweroff` performs rebooting at the laptop I'm
working on. I tried USB_QUIRK_RESET_RESUME, not helping.

The quirks list will go longer and longer absolutely, do uvcvideo wanna
maintain that? And why only uvcvideo do this in kernel space which
against general USB module?

I still suggest we disable it by default, people can enable it in udev
just like almost all distroes do for udisks. Please consider about it.
