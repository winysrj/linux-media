Subject: Video4Linux2 developer needed for H.264/MPEG-4 capture cards
From: Curtis Hall <chall@corp.bluecherry.net>

We are actively seeking a developer for our line of H.264 / MPEG-4
capture cards.  The driver is mostly mature, but several tweaks and
enhancements are still needed, along with continued support to our
customers.  This position would work closely with our team of
developers working on our Linux surveillance application.

You *must* have previous experience with MPEG-4 / H.264 video formats.
 Previous gstreamer experience would be useful.

Information about the card and features of the driver can be found here:

https://github.com/bluecherrydvr/solo6x10

Technically we do not have a requirement on *where* you live, as this
position is a telecommuting position.  We would however like for your
to be available during the times that our US developers are working.

Being that Video4Linux developers are pretty unique, I figured I would
post on this forum first, before we started targeting various job
boards.

We have positions for part and full-time, so please send inquires to
jobs@bluecherrydvr.com

Thanks!
