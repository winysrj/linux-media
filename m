Could you please try the enclosed patch? It should fix the issue.
I should probably rename T_ANALOG_TV to just T_TV, but I'll do it on
a next patch if this one works ok, as we don't want to send a renaming
patch to -stable.

[media] Fix Digital TV breakage with mt20xx tuner

The mt20xx tuner passes V4L2_TUNER_DIGITAL_TV to tuner core. However, the
check_mode code now doesn't handle it well. Change the logic there to
avoid the breakage, and fix a test for analog-only at g_tuner.
