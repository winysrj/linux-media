hi,

i've puschased a new DVB-T adapter made by lifeview:

it's called flytv express m5 mst t2a2

http://www.lifeview.com.tw/html/products/external_tv/flytv_express_m5_mst_t=
2a2.htm

it has a saa7162 pci-express bridge, here it's described:

  http://www.linuxtv.org/v4lwiki/index.php/Saa7162_devices

my card, an external ExpressCard is missing, maybe i'll fill the wiki with a
description.

anyway i see that linux support of this multimedia chip has been surfacing =
in
May 2007:

  http://www.linuxtv.org/pipermail/linux-dvb/2007-May/017856.html

but then it was never heard again..

is there something i can do to test the "GPL-like" driver released by =F9ph=
ilips
or some real datasheet about this chip.

on nexperia/nxp site this product has been discontinued! so not so hot, it
seems..

http://www.nxp.com/#/pip/pip=3D[pip=3DSAA7162E_SDS_2]|pp=3D[t=3Dpip,i=3DSAA=
7162E_SDS_2]

BTW that card doesn't go at all with the latest manufacturer driver on wind=
ows
Vista (the other OS on this new laptop..) so it's very difficult to make re=
verse
engineering at all..

bye

andrea venturi
