What do you mean by "locally"?

The problem with the api was that the phy core wanted a id and a name to
create a phy, and then later other code was doing a "lookup" based on
the name and id (mushed together), because it "knew" that this device
was the one it wanted.

Just like the clock api, which, for multiple devices, has proven to
cause problems.  I don't want to see us accept an api that we know has
issues in it now, I'd rather us fix it up properly.

Subsystems should be able to create ids how ever they want to, and not
rely on the code calling them to specify the names of the devices that
way, otherwise the api is just too fragile.

I think, that if you create a device, then just carry around the pointer
to that device (in this case a phy) and pass it to whatever other code
needs it.  No need to do lookups on "known names" or anything else, just
normal pointers, with no problems for multiple devices, busses, or
naming issues.

I agree, so just pass around the pointer to the phy and all is good.  No
need to worry about DT or ACPI or anything else.

The clock api is having problems with multiple "names" due to dynamic
devices from what I was told.  I want to prevent the PHY interface from
having that same issue.
