Hi Tomoya,

This is a pretty big patch and it will take some time to review properly.
However, I can give some high-level comments already based on an initial
scan of the code.

1) New drivers that use controls (G/S_CTRL et al) must use the new control
framework. See Documentation/video4linux/v4l2-controls.txt. We are slowly
converting existing drivers to this framework, and I don't want to add to that
workload :-)

2) The sensor drivers should be named 'ov7620', 'ncm13j', etc. and be
independent of (and not refer to) the IOH driver. After all, these sensor
drivers can be used in other devices as well.

3) ioh_video_in.c is definitely too large with 4704 lines. I would strongly
suggest splitting it in multiple files.

4) There are a bunch of IOH_VIDEO_ private ioctls. I haven't had time to analyse
them, but it would help a lot if you could write some sort of overview of what
they do and why you need them. I suspect that some can be replaced by private
controls, some might already be available in V4L2 and some might need extensions
to V4L2 (I hope not, though).

5) The OH_VIDEO_IN_DMA_CONTIG define makes a mess of the code. Why do you need it?
I have never seen a driver that can support either DMA_CONTIG or VMALLOC and I would
like to know some background information here. BTW, 2.6.39 merges the new videobuf2
framework (the successor to videobuf), which I would recommend that you use. It is
much easier to work with and understand than videobuf.

Regards,

	Hans
