Hi all,

I have a driver for a USB video camera that I'd like to see added to
the mainline kernel, mainly so I don't have to fix breakage due to
constant changes in the kernel :-).

The code is GPL and is available here:

    http://stage.bcode.com/erikd/ovcamchip

and the history of this code is here:

    http://stage.bcode.com/erikd/ovcamchip/README

My problem is that I am way too busy to sheperd this into the kernel
myself. If someone is willing to work on getting this in, I can send
them a camera to keep. If getting paid is more likely to help someone
focus on the task then that is also a possibility.

Any takers? Please email me privately.

Cheers,
Erik
