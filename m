Only a pure brainless idiot who understands less than nothing can rant
crap like this.....

Typical Pitton, typical no-brain quality....

Completely irrelevant, stupid moron!

Don't owe no Pinnacle any longer for years now.

I personally took part in flexcop development as well-informed people
know.
That's a good driver now, and Patrick is someone you can really work
with, not unproblematic, but OK so far.
He's no Abraham, and he's no Pitton....


There's one thing I would really like to know:
Is there one example where your personal dumb rant was really helpful?

As the alevt example showed you're even too dumb to test a simple
application.
Where is your quality, where is your positive usable substance please?

I do not see any. I never saw any. Whenever I read your postings I am
very close to vomit because of the enormous amount of emptyness and
thickness speaking between the lines.
So why don't you simply fuck off, consume your alcohol / drugs elsewhere
and stay away from here? No one needs you, no one will be missing you
stinking brainless moron.

Dumb rant, pure no-brained dumbness and hostility - that's everything
connected with the name "Hermann Pitton".
Even ordinary trolls are more agreeable than you will ever be....
