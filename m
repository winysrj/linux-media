There are a number of auctions on EBay atm for a

USB Digital DVB-S Satellite TV Tuner Box PVR DVR

The picture is fairly nondescript; being the original black box!  They
come with remotes and drivers for Windows (2000/XP) and are all located
in China.

Does anyone have any experience of using these with Linux?  Without
model nos or chipsets it's difficult to look anything up in the Wiki.  I
run a Mythbuntu system and it would be nice to access Freesat,
especially since it appears you don't need any specific-to-Freesat box
nonsense.

Thanks for your help,

Rob Clive
