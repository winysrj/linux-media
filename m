Yes, agreed. My idea with exposing vram sections using numa nodes wasn't
to reuse all the existing allocation policies directly, those won't work.
So at boot-up your default numa policy would exclude any vram nodes.

But I think (as an -mm layman) that numa gives us a lot of the tools and
policy interface that we need to implement what we want for gpus.

Wrt isolation: There's a sliding scale of what different users expect,
from full auto everything, including migrating pages around if needed to
full isolation all seems to be on the table. As long as we keep vram nodes
out of any default allocation numasets, full isolation should be possible.
