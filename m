Can we say that if width != 0 and height != 0 then the user knows the
real coded resolution? And vise versa if width/height are both zero the
driver should parse the stream metadata?

Also what about fmt.pix_mp.plane_fmt.sizeimage, as per spec (S_FMT) this
field should be filled with correct image size? If the coded
width/height is zero sizeimage will be unknown. I think we have two
options, the user fill sizeimage with bigger enough size or the driver
has to have some default size.

maybe an example of such coded formats will be good to have.
