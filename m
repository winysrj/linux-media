Hi Antti, if you want access to the test environment just give me an
email, it is interesting because currently the Afatech AF9013 DVB-T is
in that weird lock down mode I talked you about! It would be very nice
if you can detect if it is a software or hardware issue, because the
devices doesn't tune anymore but seems to respond to other stuff.

Best regards,
