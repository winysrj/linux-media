To my knowledge nobody is working on it.  In general the Mac products
tend to be much more expensive than their Windows equivalents, and
thus very few developers own units to test/debug with.

For example, I added support for one of the original EyeTV products
which I added the driver support for, but it was a fluke that it fell
in my lap.  I wouldn't have gone out and spent $129.00 to buy one just
to add Linux support for it.
