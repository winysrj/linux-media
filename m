Actually, it's working fine on both 50Hz and 60Hz standards. I tested
PAL-Nc using my modifications, and I had an small error in the
hweight_long usage. My bad!

So... now I think it's working properly, for 50Hz the requested FPS matches
the actual FPS, and for 60Hz there's a slight difference:

* 24 FPS gives 23.50 FPS
* 22 FPS gives 21.66 FPS
* 20 FPS gives 20 FPS
* 10 FPS gives 10 FPS
* 6 FPS give 5 FPS
* 2 FPS gives 1.66 FPS

Output FPS values are those measured by qv4l2.
