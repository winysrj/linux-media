Yes, but this makes things worse: it will allow compiling drivers that Kernel
will never use, as they won't work without an I2C adapter, and the I2C adapter
is not compiled.

Worse than that: if you go into all V4L bridge drivers, that implements the I2C
adapters and disable them, the I2C ancillary adapters will still be compiled
(as they won't return to 'n'), but they will never ever be used...

So, no, this is not a solution.

What we need is to prompt the menu only if the user wants to do some manual configuration.
Otherwise, just use the selects done by the drivers that implement the I2C bus adapters,
and have some code to use those selected I2C devices.

Cheers,
Mauro.
