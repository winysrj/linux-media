Mauro,

This patch moves the sta2x11_vip driver to the staging directory. In my opinion
this driver is not ready for prime-time.

As I mentioned a week ago, I never saw this driver when it was posted as that
was during a period were I was unavoidably absent from the list. The problem
with this driver is that it doesn't use any of the new frameworks (the control
framework and videobuf2 in particular), and this should be corrected first.

In addition it has a clear V4L2 API violation in that only one filehandle at
a time can open the video node. Developers really *must* run v4l2-compliance
before posting a new driver! Almost all of this would be caught by that tool
(except for using videobuf instead of vb2). Personally I think showing the
output of v4l2-compliance should be a requirement for getting a driver merged
under drivers/media/video.

I didn't get any reply from Federico when I posted my concerns last week, so
that makes me unhappy as well.

I hope the author will fix these issues, but in the meantime this will move
it to staging waiting for further developments.

Regards,

	Hans
