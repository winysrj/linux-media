E.g. you send the decode commands in decode order to the UVD block and if you have overlay active one of the frames are going to be the first to display and then you want to wait for it on the display side.

nouveau has sort of a scheduler in hardware. It can yield when waiting on a semaphore. And each process gets their own context and the timeslices can be adjusted. ;-) But I don't mind changing this patch when an actual user pops up. Nouveau can do a  wait for (*sema & mask) != 0 only on nvc0 and newer, where mask can be chosen. But it can do == somevalue and >= somevalue on older relevant optimus hardware, so if we know that it was zero before and we know the sign of the new value that could work too.

Adding ops and a separate mask later on when users pop up is fine with me, the original design here was chosen so I could map the intel status page read-only into the process specific nvidia vm.
