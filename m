Antonio,

the report for tda10046 firmware loading is missing. Was that OK?

LR301 is a LifeView design. It is very common to see multiple other
subvendors for their cards, but they keep the original subdevice ID.
In this case 0x0301. The subvendor 0x4e42 is usually Typhoon/Anubis and
they are distributing clones of almost all LifeView cards.

Gpio init is the same like on the other known LR301 cards and eeprom
differs only for a few bytes, but not for tuner type, tuner and demod
address.

Since this design with a saa7134 chip and tda8274 DVB-T only tuner is very old,
I don't expect an additional Low Noise Amplifier on it.

We can't detect such LNAs and on newer cards they can cause problems, if
not configured correctly and might cause "scan" to fail.

If you mean above other card types did previously work for your card,
use them and report.

Sorry, I don't have better ideas for your card so far.

Cheers,
Hermann
