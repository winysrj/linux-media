Hi,

This series adds Gen3 VIN support to rcar-vin driver for Renesas r8a7795,
r8a7796 and r8a77970. It is based on the media-tree and depends on some 
of Fabrizio Castro patches as they touches the order of the compatible 
strings in the documentation to reduce merge conflicts. The dependencies 
are:

[PATCH v2 1/4] dt-bindings: media: rcar_vin: Reverse SoC part number list
[PATCH v2 2/4] dt-bindings: media: rcar_vin: add device tree support for r8a774[35]

The driver is tested on Renesas H3 (r8a7795, ES2.0),
M3-W (r8a7796) together with the rcar-csi2 driver (posted separately and
not yet upstream) and the Salvator-X onboard ADV7482. It is also tested 
on the V3M (r8a77970) on the Eagle board together with its expansion 
board with a ADV7482.

It is possible to capture both CVBS and HDMI video streams,
v4l2-compliance passes with no errors and media-ctl can be used to
change the routing and formats for the different entities in the media
graph.

Gen2 compatibility is verified on Koelsch and no problems where found,
video can be captured just like before and v4l2-compliance passes
without errors or warnings just like before this series.

I have started on a very basic test suite for the VIN driver at:

  https://git.ragnatech.se/vin-tests

And as before the state of the driver and information about how to test
it can be found on the elinux wiki:

  http://elinux.org/R-Car/Tests:rcar-vin

* Changes since v7
- Dropped '[PATCH v7 02/25] rcar-vin: register the video device at probe time'
- Add patch which renames four badly name functions. Some of the 
  renaming was in v7 part of the dropped patch 02/25. Make it a own 
  patch and rename all badly named functions in one patch.
- Add patch to replace part of the functionality of the dropped patch v7 
  02/25. The new patch keeps the subdevice (un)registration calls in the 
  async callbacks bind() and unbind() but moves the direct subdevice 
  initialization which only is used on Gen2 from the Gen2 and Gen3 
  shared rvin_v4l2_register().
- Add patch to enable Renesas V3M (r8a77970)
- Patch 'rcar-vin: parse Gen3 OF and setup media graph' have had code 
  additions since v7 since it now registers the video devices in the 
  async complete() callback instead of at probe time as an effect of 
  dropping v7 02/25.
  - The complete() callback now register all video devices.
  - The unbind() callback now unregister all video devices.
  - A new member '*notifier' is added to struct rvin_group which keeps 
    track of which rcar-vin instance have registered its notifier on the 
    groups behalf.
  For the reason above all Reviewed-by tags have been dropped for this 
  patch.
- Replaced all kernel messages which used of_node_full_name() as now 
  only returns the basename and not till full path, thanks Geert.

    printk("%s", of_node_full_name(ep)); -> printk("%pOF", ep);

- Added Reviewed-by tags from Hans, big thanks!

* Changes since v6
- Rebase ontop of latest media-tree which brings in the use of the
  fwnode async helpers for Gen2.
- Updated DT binding documentation, thanks Laurent for very helpful
  input!
- Removed help text which where copied in from v4l2_ctrl_handler_init()
  documentation when moving that code block, this was a residue from the
  soc_camera conversion and should have been removed at that time.
- Removed bad check of tvnorms which disables IOCTLs if it's not set,
  this was a residue from soc_camera conversion and have use in the
  current driver.
- Moved all subdevice initialization from complete to bound handler
  while improving the unbind handler. With this move all operations of
  the ctrl_handler from the subdevice is handled in either bound or
  unbind removing races pointed out by Laurent.
- Renamed rvin_v4l2_probe() -> rvin_v4l2_register() and
  rvin_v4l2_remove() -> rvin_v4l2_unregister().
- Fold rvin_mbus_supported() into its only caller.
- Sort compatible string entries in ascending order.
- Improved documentation for struct rvin_group_chsel.
- Clarify comment in rvin_group_csi_pad_to_chan().
- Make use of of_device_get_match_data() as suggested by Geert.
- Fixed spelling mistakes.
- Added review tags from Hans.

* Changes since v5
- Extract and make use of common format checking for both Gen2 and Gen3.
- Assign pad at declaration time in rvin_get_sd_format()
- Always call pm_runtime_{get_sync,put}() and v4l2_pipeline_pm_use()
  when opening/closing a video device, remove the check of
  v4l2_fh_is_singular_file().
- Make rvin_set_chsel() return void instead of int since it always
  return 0.
- Simplify the VIN group allocator functions.
- Make the group notifier callbacks and setup more robust.
- Moved the video device registration back to probe time.
- Add H3 ES2.0 support.
- Fix handling of single field formats (top, bottom, alternate) as this
  was obviously wrong before but hidden by the Gen2 scaler support.
- Added review tags from Kieran.

* Changes since v4 (Not posted to ML)
- Updated to the new fwnode functions.
- Moved the registration of the video devices to the async notification
  callback.

* Changes since v3
- Only add neighboring subdevices to the async notifier. Instead of
  parsing the whole OF graph depend on incremental async subnotifier to
  discover the whole pipeline. This is needed to support arbitrarily
  long graphs and support the new ADV7482 prototype driver which Kieran
  is working on.
- Fix warning from lockdep, reported by Kieran.
- Fix commit messages from feedback from Sergei, thanks.
- Fix chip info an OF device ids sorting order, thanks Geert.
- Use subdev->of_node instead of subdev->dev->of_node, thanks Kieran.

* Changes since v2
- Do not try to control the subdevices in the media graph from the rcar-vin
  driver. Have user-space configure to format in the pipeline instead.
- Add link validation before starting the stream.
- Rework on how the subdevices are and the video node behave by defining
  specific V4L2 operations for the MC mode of operation, this simplified
  the driver quit a bit, thanks Laurent!
- Add a new 'renesas,id' DT property which is needed to to be able to
  keep the VIN to CSI-2 routing table inside the driver. Previously this
  information was taken from the CSI-2 DT node which is obviously the
  wrong way to do things. Thanks Laurent for pointing this out.
- Fixed a memory leek in the group allocator function.
- Return -EMLINK instead of -EBUSY if a MC link is not possible given
  the current routing setup.
- Add comments to clarify that the 4 channels from the CSI-2 node is not
  directly related to CSI-2 virtual channels, the CSI-2 node can output
  any VC on any of its output channels.

* Changes since v1
- Remove unneeded casts as pointed out by Geert.
- Fix spelling and DT documentation as pointed out by Geert and Sergei,
  thanks!
- Refresh patch 2/32 with an updated version, thanks Sakari for pointing
  this out.
- Add Sakaris Ack to patch 1/32.
- Rebase on top of v4.9-rc1 instead of v4.9-rc3 to ease integration
  testing together with renesas-drivers tree.
