Agreed, exactly that couple weeks requirement seemed a bit long to me.

I believe what you're describing is true for most subsystems.  At
linux-media the process looks roughly that you prepare a patch and post
it to the mailing list for review.  Regular developers review it, you
address the comments and submit again.  Repeat these steps until
everyone's happy.  Then, when the patch looks like it is ready for
merging it is preferred to send the maintainer a pull request.
Now there can be a delay of up to couple weeks.  Afterwards the patch
in most cases gets merged, with a few possible change requests. However
it may happen the maintainer has different views on what's has been
agreed before and you start everything again.

With a few sub-maintainers recently appointed hopefully there can be
seen some improvement.

Yeah, it's not unusual to work with specific -rc tree with multiple
subsystem -next branches on top of it.

It's just those cases where you're told to get feature A in the kernel
release X and it is already late in the development cycle... But it
might just be a matter of planning the work adequately with proper
understanding of the whole process.
