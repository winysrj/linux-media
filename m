Funky timing of those mails :D.

I saw only after sending my mail that Steve was talking about analog and
that this is indeed different. Dual analog tuner support should be
possible right? Maybe with some other analog usb chipsets? I don't know
what the usb blocksize is or if they are isochronous transfers or bulk
or control.

I assume the video must be uncompressed transferred over usb because the
decoding chip is on the usb device is not capable of doing compression
encoding after the analog video decoding? Are there usb devices that do
such tricks?

Best regards,

Jelle
