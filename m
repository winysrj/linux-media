Geez, you're right.  Not sure what was going on in my head when I did this.  Thanks for catching it.

The intention is to do some ratio math without floating point instructions, which resulted in some algebraic twiddling (which is why that math looks so weird).  I think what's there is okay.  If there's any rounding at all (and there shouldn't be any rounding, if "standard" image dimensions are called for), then there's going to be some aspect ratio weirdness no matter which way you round that division.
