It all boils down to making sure that you don't free the memory which is 
used as target of DMA transfer.

This is very likely to hit you when DMA memory region is on stack, but 
blindly just converting this to kmalloc()/kfree() isn't any better if you 
don't make sure that all the DMA transfers have been finished and device 
will not be making any more to that particular memory region.
