Does anybody here understand how  tuner hardware work?
>From my understanding tuner sends output voltage( 13V/18V) to LNB( in satellite dish) and 
from LNB  input voltage is coming to tuner chip then to demodulator chip and to data bus and 
those data goes to CPU of the satellite receiver.
I have one tuner module that has signal ( measured by oscilloscope) on data bus but sattelite 
receiver shows no picture, so the data on data bus is probbaly decoded in a wrong way.
So, can anyone suggest a way what procedure to use to find out which part( electronic chip) 
is faulty?
Thanks for feedback
