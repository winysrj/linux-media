Hi Andy and Jean-Francois,

>From my perspective, the advantage of using the standard macros for
errors are:

1) Consistency. Except for patches 06 and 14, the other patches were
acked by the maintainers or by me, for the drivers that I maintain
or whose maintainer didn't nack. Also, the same sort of macros are
being used on other places at the Kernel;

2) One of the proposed themes for discussion at the KS/2011 is how to
improve the error reporting. While printk works, there are better
ways of doing it than just printing the error at the console. I'm
working on something like that with regards to hardware errors,
reported via MCE and EDAC subsystems. The idea there is to convert
the printk reports into structured trace events, making easier for
userspace to deal with the errors.

Making all places to use the same macros for it using a similar format
seems to be the first step for replacing the current way for a better
one.

Regards,
Mauro
