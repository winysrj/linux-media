There's no approval process. Just submit the "subscribe linux-media" message to
the mailman email interface. It will send you a reply to confirm your email
address. After your reply-back, you'll be subscribed.

> 2. I agree with another poster: I only care about broadcast and cable video, both analog and digital.  I eventually hope to help get my "AnyTV AUTV002 USB ATSC/QAM Tuner Stick" supported by V4L, and then use it in a MythTV system.  I'd prefer a list that focuses on such devices and systems, if possible.  Which seems to match the mission of linux-dvb!

linux-dvb were used for DVB only. No analog tuner, Composite or S-video entries
were meant to be discussed there. Another ML were used for those discussions.
So, on the case of your device, before linux-media, people needed to do
cross-posting.

However, on several cases, only one of the lists were used by the thread
authors. So, if you were interested on such boards, you would need to subscribe
both lists, otherwise, you would loose some discussions that could be
interesting for you.

Cheers,
Mauro
