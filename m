Do you have any other non-uvc device to test?

This ioctl returns -ENOTTY already with other media drivers on v3.7.

This change is new, and, AFAIKT, only UVC returns -ENOENT on 3.8-rc1.

This is likely the source of the troubles.

Yeah, it started an endless loop here, likely because kde4 seems to be
expecting either 0 or -EINVAL error code for VIDIOC_QUERYCTRL.

It should be noticed that there are other valid error codes here. For
example, if this ioctl is not implemented, -ENOTTY may also be returned.
Fortunately, almost all drivers do implement this ioctl.

The expected return error codes for this ioctl are described at:
	http://linuxtv.org/downloads/v4l-dvb-apis/vidioc-queryctrl.html

In practice, except for the uvc driver, the current return codes are
EINVAL/EACCES/ENOTTY.

Rafael made a patch fixing it, and Linus should be applying it.
