Some are 64B (a batch of eight 8B descriptors).  Some are 16B.

These Myricom devices are very non-standard in my opinion, at least in
the Ethernet world.  Few, if any, other devices depend so much on WC
like these do.  I think almost all devices now have rings in host
memory.  The NIC pulls them via DMA.  No need for WC, and no need to
special case registers...

For this particular Myricom device, performance penalty stems from the
use of slow path in the firmware.  They are not about how effectively
we use PCI Express or latency or bandwidth.  Small MWr packets end up
casuing slow path processing via the firmware in this device.

There are HPC low latency NICs that use WC for different reasons.  To
reduce latency as much as possible, some of these copy small packets
to the NIC memory via PIO (BAR0, and so on), instead of DMA.  They
want WC mapping to minimize PCI Express packets/transactions.

I do not know about video adapters and their use for WC.

Right.  The device polls the last word to start sending, DMA, etc.

Hopefully, the above text answers some of your questions.
