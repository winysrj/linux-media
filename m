I've already said it before: We won't be implementing an API for a device just 
for "consistency" without any real reason.

MC doesn't work for audio yet, as snd-usb-audio doesn't use it. So, it will fail
for a large amount of devices whose audio is implemented using standard USB
Audio Class. Adding MC support for it doesn't sound trivial, and won't offer
any gain over the sysfs equivalent.

Even For SoC, such info would probably be useful. As I said before, with the
current way, I can't see how a generic MC aware application would do the right
thing for the devices that currently implement the MC api, simply because
there's no way for an application to know what pipelines need to be configured, as
no entity at the MC (or elsewhere on some userspace library) describes what
pipelines are meant to be used by the common usecase.

> It would be trivial to add precisely this type of information, though.

Yes, adding a new field to indicate what type of V4L devnode is there won't 
be hard, but it would be better to replace the "MEDIA_ENT_T_DEVNODE_V4L" by
something that actually describes the device type. The same kind of logic
might also applies also to other device types. For example, ALSA means a
playback, a capture or a mixer device? Or does it mean the complete audio
hardware? (probably not, as it would hide alsa internal pipelines).

"grabber" is for sure another type.

The thing with the device type at the name is that S_INPUT may actually change the
type of device.

Btw, a proper implementation for the MC API for a device that has audio/video muxes 
internally would require to map the internal pipelines via MC. So, it is something
that just adding a V4L core "glue" won't work. So, even a "simple" device like em28xx
or bttv would require lots of changes internally, as those things are currently not
implemented fully as sub-devices. It will also create a conflict at userspace, as 
the same pipeline could be changed via two different API's. As I said before, too
much changes for no benefit.

It is not one device node per hardware unit. Sysfs is needed to match snd-usb-audio
with the corresponding video device.

Implementing MC to cover the non-SoC cases may work after lots of efforts. It is like
implementing a nuclear bomb to kill a bug. It will work, but a bug spray insecticide
will produce the same effect with a very small cost to implement.
