In France, the DVB-T channels are currently moving (because the analog 
TV is being removed at the same time)
The frequencies are modified region by region, with a calendar that 
started in late 2009, and will end on november 29th 2011 (see 
http://www.tousaunumerique.fr/ou-et-quand/ )

All the new channels are listed here : 
http://www.tousaunumerique.fr/professionnels/en-savoir-plus/documentation/categorie-doc/plans-de-frequences/ 
. The PDF files also lists channels that are planned to be used in the 
future (but are unused at the moment)

Is there already a plan to update the scan files to reflect these changes?
