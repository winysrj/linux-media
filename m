I'm not sure about "nobody", but even though it might not be my favorite 
option I'd be OK with that.

With backlinks in DT we can assume that, if a node is the target of a link, it 
will be compatible with the of-graph bindings, and thus parse the node to 
locate other ports and other links. This allows parsing the full graph without 
help of individual drivers.

Without backlinks in DT we need to parse the full DT to reconstruct backlinks 
in the kernel. One possible issue with that is that we can't know whether a 
node implements the of-graph bindings. We can use the heuristic you've 
described above, but I wonder if it could lead to problems. Grant pointed out 
that the compatibility string defines what binding a node uses, and that we 
can't thus look for properties randomly. I don't think there's a risk to 
interpret an unrelated node as part of a graph though.

I would also not mandate a specific direction at the of-graph level and leave 
it to subsystems (or possibly drivers) to specify the direction.
