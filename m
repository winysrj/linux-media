If camera streams compressed video the patch doesn't affect it. It
affects only uncompressed streams.

If we get EOF bit in a packet of its own with no data we take second
check under 'if (buf->state == UVC_BUF_STATE_READY)' that was before my
patch. In this case if all data were received buffer is processed
normally, but if some data is missing buffer is marked erroneous.

No, because there was no check for that in case then new frame is
detected by FID toggling, it was there only for the case then new frame
is detected by EOF bit.

No, I'm concerning about uncompressed frames only.
