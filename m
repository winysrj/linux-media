This is true, and I don't mean to offend anyone's sensibilities about
it.  Likewise, I did state that it remains a very useful resource.

However, I haven't seen a word of boo from Gunther in probably two years
time.  Secondly, some of those users that I had, in the past, requested
that they submit material to the bttv-gallery have later written/replied
to me that their submissions went unanswered/unacknowledged.  Thirdly,
despite Gunther's distinguished history and involvement, it is likely
unclear to an unassuming end user that there is anything other then a
passing relation between the project and the "bttv-gallery".
