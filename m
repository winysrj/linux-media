I don't think there's a really good solution to the problem in upstream.

For what it's worth, the USERPTR buffers are allocated non-coherent, and the
cache is flushed when that's needed.

I have a patchset that makes it driver-selectable whether to request
coherent or non-coherent memory. I haven't had time to work on that for a
while, unfortunately, that work stalled in fixing a few drivers that access
the buffers using the CPU as well when they really should not do that.

I sent the set here under the subject "[RFC RESEND 00/11] vb2: Handle user
cache hints, allow drivers to choose cache coherency" last September.

If you don't need to access the buffers using the CPU, you could avoid
flushing the cache as well, but it requires patches from that set as well.
