Arnd,

Ill look at converting the ep93xx pwm driver to the PWM subsystem. The only issue is
the current driver exposes a sysfs interface that I think is not available in that subsystem.

The ep93xx pwm driver does not need to use platform_driver_probe(). It can be changed
to use module_platform_driver() by just moving the .probe to the platform_driver. This
driver was added before module_platform_driver() was available and I used the
platform_driver_probe() thinking it would save a couple lines of code.

I'll change this in a bit. Right now I'm trying to work out why kernel 3.8 is not booting
on the ep93xx. I had 3.6.6 on my development board and 3.7 works fine but 3.8 hangs
without uncompressing the kernel.

Regards,
Hartley
