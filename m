OK, that's what I thought.  I just wanted to ensure that busy CX23418
chips are not going to delay the processing of other work-events in the
rest the system down.

Right.  As a CX23418 is expected to do more streaming by the host, the
mailbox mutex contention goes up and the latency of the CX23418
responding to mailbox commands also goes up so there is more wait()ing.

Correct, CPU is not the concern here.

Thanks.  I'll do a proper inspection of the patch tonight.  It looked OK
on cursory review.
