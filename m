I saw that few times too, but it does not cause any other harm than 
error printing. It went away when canceled that delayed gate closing 
timer during demod sleep. But that was device which doesn't have slave 
demod at all, so it does not apply to your case as integrated demod 
sleep is not called at all. I think some callback which does opposite 
than "enable_slave_ts()" is needed. Like "disable_slave_ts()" which 
kills that timer before demod is powered off.
