isolate_freepages_block operates on a range of pages that happens to be
hard-coded to be a pageblock because that was the requirements. It calculates
end_pfn and it is possible to make that a function parameter.

Ok, I jumped the gun here. release_freepages() may not be a perfect fit.
release_freepages() is also used when finishing compaction where as it
is a real free function that is required here.

Ok, I'm still not fully convinced but I confess I'm not thinking about this
particular function too deeply because I am expecting the problem would
go away if compaction and CMA shared common code for freeing contiguous
regions via page migration.

I'm referring to just this chunk.

split_free_page takes a page, checks the watermarks and performs similar
operations to prep_new_page(). There should be no need to introduce a
new similar function. split_free_page() does affect hte pageblock
migratetype and that is undesirable but that part could be taken out and
moved to compaction.c if necessary.

On the watermarks thing, CMA does not pay much attention to them. I have
a strong feeling that it is easy to deadlock a system by using CMA while
under memory pressure. Compaction had the same problem early in its
development FWIW. This is partially why I'd prefer to see CMA and
compaction sharing as much code as possible because compaction gets
continual testing.
