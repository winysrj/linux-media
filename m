Half a day should be more than enough to start with. The topic is quite 
complex, and we'll need to sleep over it, several times. A full day would just 
result in brain overheat. I was thinking more in the line of starting our 
thought process, so maybe twice an hour or two hours would be good. That would 
allow us to attend the ELCE talks as well :-) (there's definitely a couple of 
them that I would like to listen to).
