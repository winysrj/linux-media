I think the clock & voltage regulator framework changes in omap3beagle.c 
would require reverting for earlier versions? Are there any other things 
I should watch out for?

Thanks. The nice thing about the GIMP import tool is interactiveness, 
which is good when (I suspect) I don't know the proper image dimensions.

I think you missed my ingenious sensor crop. ;) The sensor should be 
capable of scaling to 800x600 if it crops to (96,72)/2400x1800 first 
(this just requires 3x binning). I tried this on 3.2.24 and it worked.

But why does those cropping differences (between 3.2.24 and 3.10) happen 
at all? I run the same live code on 3.2.24 and 3.10, with the same 
sensor and output resolution. I think I got the same `media-ctl -p` 
output after running `live` on both kernels but will check this tomorrow.

If these internal cropping rectangles on 3.10 were wrong it would 
probably explain the "bad synchronization" problem.
