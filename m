Hey, thanks to all who have contributed to the KWorld-120 v4l driver! 
If it wasn't obvious, I've been enjoying the sound and video from my v4l 
driven KWorld-120 for months now.

So, are these IR remote control patches in Staging (the v4l somewhat 
stable pre-release version).  I've pulled and compiled from that repo 
before - no problem if that's where the new IR code is.

...thanks
