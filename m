I have nothing to say directly about those patches - they looked good at 
the quick check. But I wonder if you have any idea if it is possible to 
use some existing Kernel GPIO functionality in order to provide standard 
interface (interface like I2C). I did some work last summer in order to 
use GPIOLIB and it is used between em28xx-dvb and cxd2820r for LNA 
control. Anyhow, I was a little bit disappointed as GPIOLIB is disabled 
by default and due to that there is macros to disable LNA when GPIOLIB 
is not compiled.
I noticed recently there is some ongoing development for Kernel GPIO. I 
haven't looked yet if it makes use of GPIO interface more common...
