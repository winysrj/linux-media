Actually, would it be possible to do the patches the other way around?

V4L2 api already knows about flash, torch and indicators. Provide
glue, so that V4L2 torch automatically appears as two leds in the led
subystem? (white and red in my case?)

[Well, I kind of like the LED class API more, but it appears both you
and me really have two LEDs in one package, and V4L2 already knows
about that so it is better match....?]
