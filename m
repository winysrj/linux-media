I think atomic_read()s are cheap, at least on intel as IIRC they don't 
require bus locking,
still I think we should keep it within CONFIG_PROVE_LOCKING

which btw reminds me there's an optimization that can be done in that 
one should really only
call atomic_cmpxchg() if a preceding atomic_read() hints that it will 
succeed.

Now, does this mean TTM can keep the atomic reserve <-> lru list removal?

Thanks,
Thomas
