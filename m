Hi,

I got some questions to fence_excl and fence_shared. At the above
code, if bo->fence_excl is not NULL then it puts bo->fence_excl and
sets a new fence to it. This seems like that someone that committed a
new fence, wants to access the given dmabuf exclusively even if
someone is accessing the given dmabuf.

On the other hand, in case of fence_shared, someone wants to access
that dmabuf non-exclusively. So this case seems like that the given
dmabuf could be accessed by two more devices. So I guess that the
fence_excl could be used for write access(may need buffer sync like
blocking) and read access for the fence_shared(may not need buffer
sync). I'm not sure that I understand these two things correctly so
could you please give me more comments for them?

Thanks,
Inki Dae
