Additional to that we need allot of special handling in case of a hardware lockup here, which isn't done if you abuse the fence interface like this.

Please don't modify the fence interface at all and instead use the wait functions already exposed by radeon_fence.c. If you need some kind of signaling mechanism then wait inside a workqueue instead.
> The fence takes up the role of a single shot workqueue here. Manually resetting the counter and calling wake_up_all would end up waking all active fences, there's no special handling needed inside radeon for this.

Yeah that's actually the point here, you NEED to activate ALL fences, 
otherwise the fence handling inside the driver won't work.

Which is perfectly fine. What actually is the use case of not stalling a 
process who wants to wait for something?

No thanks, we even abandoned that concept internal in the driver. Please 
use the blocking wait functions instead.
