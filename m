Good to hear that the support on the backend is much better than on the 
early years of DVB+Linux.
Anyway as a customer I can't recommended products of a manufacturer if 
the customer "support" complete ignores any questions, and I don't asked 
something about linux.
But of course I am currently unable to appoint any company with good 
customer support, so maybe it doesn't make sense to use such a criteria 
if you want to buy something...
