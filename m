Actually this contiguous memory allocator is a better replacement for
alloc_pages() which is used by dma_alloc_coherent(). It is a generic
framework that is not tied only to ARM architecture.

This is an arm specific problem, also related to dma_alloc_coherent()
allocator. To be 100% conformant with ARM specification we would
probably need to unmap all pages used by the dma_coherent allocator
from the LOW MEM area. This is doable, but completely not related
to the CMA and this patch series.
