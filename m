Ok, that explains it.

I still don't agree here.
AFAICS an I2C timeout can only happen if clock stretching is used.
But we also get this when a slave device isn't present or doesn't
answer, which means it doesn't ACK the data.
So ETIMEDOUT is wrong.
Yes, 0x10 _could_ be a more general error. In that case EIO would be the
better choice.
But that's pure speculation as long as we don't have the datasheets.

After reading the i2c fault codes descriptions again, I would agree to
change it from ENODEV to ENXIO.
ENXIO seems to be the intended error code for NACK errors and it's a bit
more unspecific than ENODEV.

Would that be acceptable for you ?

For those I would return just EIO.
I thought we agree here ?

Yes, that's ok

I'm not sure what you mean with "generic", but yeah, that's ok, too.

Can give me a pointer to this post ?
