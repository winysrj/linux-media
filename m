 I have this hardware and willing to try and test and report back, but
I'm not a kernel programmer ... More an intergrator ... Have two
options, either I could arrange a purchase of a unit for yourself,
then you could test too, or I could test what ever you could debug, I
see that you have many v4l devices already ... Would that be of any
good?

Thanks
