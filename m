So I'm back to the Hauppauge ImpactVCB-e 01385.

Apparently it's fully supported by the current Linux kernel:

Model                 Standard Interface     Supported     Comments
ImpactVCB-e     Video PCIe                 âœ” Yes                 No 
tuners, only video-in. S-Video Capture works with kernel 3.5.0 (Ubuntu 
12.10).

So is this a typo or have I just encountered an install problem?

Would the daily build resolve this?  I haven't installed it on this test 
system, but I'm never clear when I should install it or whether I should 
just download a single driver from somewhere.
