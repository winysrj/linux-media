Keep in mind there are still discrete GPUs :), where scanning out from
anything but VRAM may not be feasible, and direct CPU access to
(especially reads from) VRAM tends to be very slow.

However, for fbcon that can be addressed in each driver (as is done e.g.
in nouveau), and has nothing to do with any userspace interface.
