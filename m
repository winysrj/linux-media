I have conflicting opinions myself weather we should use gpiolib or not.

I don't mind with the fact that GPIOLIB is disabled by default. If all
media drivers start depending on it, distros will enable it to keep
media support on it.

I never took the time to take a look on what methods gpiolib provides.
Maybe it will bring some benefits. I dunno.

Just looking at the existing drivers (almost all has some sort of GPIO
config), GPIO is just a single register bitmask read/write. Most drivers
need already bitmask read/write operations. So, in principle, I can't
foresee any code simplification by using a library.

Also, from a very pragmatic view, changing (almost) all existing drivers
to use gpiolib is a big effort.

However, for that to happen, one question should be answered: what
benefits would be obtained by using gpiolib?

Mauro
