Hi All,

The email is mainly in the interests of avoiding wasting time.

I'm currently updating the driver I posted alongside
Guennadi's soc-camera changes with the intention to also
merge features from the 3 drivers that are out there.

Unsurprisingly they all have different feature sets at the
moment and ideally we want to support everything the individual
drivers do.

Is anyone else doing or aiming to do the same?

Thanks,

---
