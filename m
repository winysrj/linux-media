They can be i2c, spi or any other device types as well.

By using a PHY lookup as Stephen and I suggested in our previous replies. 
Without any extra data in platform data. (I have even posted a code 
example.)

This is incorrect, sorry. First of all it's a layering violation - you 
export random driver-specific symbols from one driver to another. Then 
imagine 4 SoCs - A, B, C, D. There are two PHY types PHY1 and PHY2 and 
there are two types of consumer drivers (e.g. USB host controllers). Now 
consider following mapping:

SoC	PHY	consumer
A	PHY1	HOST1
B	PHY1	HOST2
C	PHY2	HOST1
D	PHY2	HOST2

So we have to be able to use any of the PHYs with any of the host drivers. 
This means you would have to export symbol with the same name from both 
PHY drivers, which obviously would not work in this case, because having 
both drivers enabled (in a multiplatform aware configuration) would lead 
to linking conflict.

Best regards,
Tomasz
