Finally got some time to play with my 1250, dug out its rx cable, turns out to
be the same one I special-ordered to work on the 1150 Devin sent me. Oops.
Anyway. First impressions, not so good. Got a panic on boot, somewhere in
cx23885_video_irq, iirc, when booting with enable_885_ir=1 set. However, dmesg
was somewhere in the middle of cx18 init of the HVR-1600 in the box. Dunno if
there's any way that's actually directly related, but I yanked the 1600. After
doing that, the box managed to boot fine, but then while testing w/ir-keytable
and an RC-6 remote, I got what I think was the same panic -- definitely the
cx23885_video_irq bit in the trace, something about sleeping while atomic, IP
at mwait_idle. (On the plus side, IR did seem to be working before that).

Note also that this is a 2.6.32-based kernel with a 2.6.38-era backport of the
driver code, because that's what was on this box. Was about to put it back into
"production" use, but hey, its summer, there's nothing really for it to record
for another few months, so I'll keep it out and throw it into another box with
a newer kernel and serial console, etc., so I can further debug...
