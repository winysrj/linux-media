Can you please elaborate on why do you need this? Are you trying to
squeeze KASAN into some embedded device?
Noinlines sprayed over the codebase are hard to maintain, and certain
compiler changes may cause bloated stack frames in other places.
Maybe it should be enough to just increase the stack frame limit in
KASAN builds, as Dmitry suggested previously?
