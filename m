Personally, I'd say the (incredibly minuscule) runtime cost is worth the
cost of making folks' eyes bleed when they see those macros.  I think
there are some nicer ways to do it.

Is there a reason you can't logically do?

	page = pfn_to_page(pfn);
	for (;;) {
		if (pfn_to_section_nr(pfn) == pfn_to_section_nr(pfn+1))
			page++;
		else
			page = pfn_to_page(pfn+1);
	}

pfn_to_section_nr() is a register shift.  Our smallest section size on
x86 is 128MB and on ppc64 16MB.  So, at *WORST* (64k pages on ppc64),
you're doing pfn_to_page() one of every 256 loops.

My suggestion would be put put a macro up in the sparsemem headers that
does something like:

#ifdef VMEMMAP
#define zone_pfn_same_memmap(pfn1, pfn2) (1)
#elif SPARSEMEM_OTHER
static inline int zone_pfn_same_memmap(unsigned long pfn1, unsigned long pfn2)
{
	return (pfn_to_section_nr(pfn1) == pfn_to_section_nr(pfn2));
}
#else
#define zone_pfn_same_memmap(pfn1, pfn2) (1)
#endif

The zone_ bit is necessary in the naming because DISCONTIGMEM's pfns are
at least contiguous within a zone.  Only the non-VMEMMAP sparsemem case
isn't.

Other folks would probably have a use for something like that.  Although
most of the previous users have gotten to this point, given up, and just
done pfn_to_page() on each loop. :)

For the love of Pete, please make those in to functions if you're going
to keep them.  They're really unreadable like that.

You might also want to look at mm/internal.h's mem_map_offset() and
mem_map_next().  They're not _quite_ what you need, but they're close.
