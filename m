Guys, NO!

The proper check is actually to remove all of that silly VERSION testing
from the userspace binary.  And then have it try EVIOCGKEYCODE_V2 first.
If EVIOCGKEYCODE_V2 fails (-ENOTTY, -EINVAL, or -ENOSYS), then
have it fall back to trying to use EVIOCGKEYCODE.

Of course this does assume that the new EVIOCGKEYCODE_V2 interface uses
correct ioctl return values..

Cheers
