Greetings ...

 I have one of the following device called "EasyCAP USB 2.0 Video
Adapter with Audio", some details could be found at
http://www.alibaba.com/product-gs/213186597/EasyCAP_USB_2_0_Video_Adapter.html

 I'm seeing many of these device in the local shops of late and was
hoping we could put some effort in and get it supported.

 Went through some of the wiki docs and they seem way too much work to
get done, for what this device is worth, so, instead of play broken
v4l2 [ phone ;-) ] with this device, I would be willing to purchase
one of these and get it sent to a developer.  I believe with the
device in hand, a developer could test and write code quicker than I
could do the needed dumps ...

 Now, if a developer of note could stand up and put some time down, I
will following up with supplying the device ...

Thanks
Mailed
LeeT

P.S. Many thanks to all the hard working guys getting this stuff all together!!
