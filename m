Hi, does the license apply specifically to the kernellabs.com firmware file,
or the header files released by Xceive (xc4000_firmwares.h, xc4000_scodes.h) ?
In the latter case, it should cover my firmware file
(dvb-fe-xc4000-1.4.fw) as well,
because it is generated from the same headers. Also, it is no longer generated
from the Leadtek Windows drivers (like it was in the past before I had access to
the Xceive header files), so it should in theory only be licensed by
Xceive, rather
than Leadtek.

>From a quick look at the contents of dvb-fe-xc4000-1.4.1.fw (the kernellabs.com
file), it appears to be missing all the firmware data related to
analog TV and radio
standards, and all scodes are (incorrectly) a copy of the one needed for
int_freq = 5400. Therefore, it only works with the demodulator used on the PCTV
340e, which is using that frequency, but not with the Leadtek cards
with zl10153,
since those require 4560 instead. It also seems to be missing some standard and
firmware type flags. I am not sure if those are responsible for the
I2C errors, or
simply the lack of the analog firmwares. Perhaps the latter if the errors do not
occur with the (currently DVB-only) PCTV 340e.

The get_frequency() change is not an issue, the kernellabs.com firmware that is
now the default and part of the kernel packages does not include data that is
required for the Leadtek cards to work.

Although I did not test it, the firmware should work with the PCTV 340e as
well. It definitely does with the Leadtek devices in DVB-T mode, and on the
PCTV 340e the only difference is the IF (5400 vs. 4560).
