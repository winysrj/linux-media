Ok, thanks. I think it would be good to post these for reference
in v3, with a clear indication that they are not being submitted
for discussion/inclusion yet.

Ok, that's what I thought.

I wasn't even thinking of user mappings, as I replied to Daniel, I
think they are easy to solve (maybe not efficiently though)

It would be nice if user space had no way to block out kernel drivers,
otherwise we have to be very careful to ensure that each map() operation
can be interrupted by a signal as the last resort to avoid deadlocks.
