Yes, that would be the Intelsat 903 we talked about. Btw, you sure it's
QPSK? If so, it's not S2, but S. :) Never mind that anyway, dear, our
discussion wasn't about existence or non-existence of high rate 8PSK
signals. In the beginning of the thread we established that there are
places on Earth with these signals (your bird seems the only one, but
there may be more!). The question was their relevance for typical US /
EU citizens *now*. There's no doubt in my mind that higher rates will
become used eventually, perhaps sooner that we think even if it may seem
unlikely - a year, two? Even during this "short time", I'll be using
standard HW which has been good enough for everybody for years and when
the time comes, there will be new HW to choose from - perhaps even
better than TT-1600. :) This is my point, the rest are just reactions to
Manu.


Btw, *Manu*, I just read your on-line resume. You're in Bangalore,
right? Funny thing, I'm in India too - for half a year already, but I'll
be leaving soon. It's business crap as usual, but India for the first
time. I kinda like it here. Destinations without proper engineers call
upon us, the European *Jedi* of the HA/HP computing, to build & install
IBM supercomputers for them and design new infrastructures. :o) If you
want to come and smash my face with a hammer, feel free to visit me in
Koregaon Park. :o)
