No. 
The _graph_build_one is used to link the subdevs found in the device 
tree. _build_video is used to link the closest subdev to video node.
Video node is created in the driver, so the method to get it's pad is
diffrent to the subdevs.

Do you mean the subdevs create pad link in the notifier registered by
themself ?
If so, _graph_build_one is needless. But how to make sure the pipeline
has linked correctly when operateing the pipeline. 
I will lookt at this in more detail.
