Hi Rob,

Any thoughts on my analysis? Do you think that LED function naming
standardization would really make sense having the abundance
of LED functions categories present in the mainline dts files?

The list of standard LED function names would have to be
continuously extended as people would be adding new boards.
Limiting users to only existing set of LED functions wouldn't
be practical IMHO.

I'd propose only to modify 'label' property description in LED common
bindings, so that it would explicitly state that it should contain only
"colour:functon" segments. It would be driver's responsibility to add
"devicename:" prefix to the label and use the whole string for a LED
class device name. Some drivers do that already. All DT bindings, dts
files and LED class drivers that don't adhere to this rule would have
to be updated accordingly.

Regarding colour - the "devicename:colour:function" LED device naming
convention defined in Documentation/leds/leds-class.txt is around for
a long time. Since LED colour can vary from board two board and is
independent of a driver, we have to have a means for defining it in
DT. Would you see providing separate 'colour' DT property as a solution?

Best regards,
Jacek Anaszewski
