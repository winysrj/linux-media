Yes, seems to happen to others too (as elicited by Hartmut, as an
example:  http://marc.info/?l=linux-dvb&m=122522508125601&w=2).

I'm not sure why Red Hat hosts the V4L list (my guess is because its
Alan Cox's baby, and Alan, who does pop up from time to time, works for
RH).  In any regard, unfortunately I don't think there are any current
administrators/moderators per se, and suspect that the list is running
solely on autopilot.

Hopefully in the future we can get a better situation sorted out, as it
certainly is, as you say, suboptimal.
