Yes, it's not really for general use.  Comment may indeed be useful here.

I'm not sure what you are asking.

The function requires the range to be marked as MIGRATE_ISOLATE and all
pages being free, so nothing can be allocated there while the function
is running.

If you are asking about CMA in general, the range that CMA uses is marked
as MIGRATE_CMA (a new migrate type) which means that only MIGRATE_MOVABLE
pages can be allocated there.  This means, that in theory, if there is
enough memory the pages can always be moved out of the region.  At leasts
that's my understanding of the type.  If this is correct, the allocation
should always succeed provided enough memory for the pages within the
region to be moved to is available.

As of practice, I have run some simple test to see if the code works and
they succeeded.  Also, Marek has run some test with actual hardware and
those worked well as well (but I'll let Marek talk about any details).
