The same combination of devices (Mantis, STB0899, STB6100) is used in
various cards, and at my side they still have tuning issues.

A few weeks ago, Austrian TV started to feed their transponder theirself
instead by Astra, and from that moment on it was impossible to tune to
that transponder. After some days they switched off spectral inversion,
and the cards were now able to tune again.

Furthermore, tuning is unstable here when signal quality is not optimal
leading to driver lock-ups. After a reload, tuning is again possible.

Beside some hard reboots caused by the xineliboutput/vdpau frontend,
this is the one remaining major problem at my setup.
