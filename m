Duh. Of course I see the problem. I've seen the problem ever since I started
working on V4L back in 2004.

Of course, since vfs_ioctl does the same thing this is clearly isn't some
isolated V4L thing. Pot. Kettle.

I call it consistently wrong :-)

Listen, this error code is wrong. But it unfortunately has been documented
like that for years. It's part of the V4L userspace API. I have no clue who
may rely on this. I have no clue what might break if we change it. And the
only way to know that is by actually releasing a kernel with that change.

It was my understanding that we shouldn't break the userspace API. This breaks
the userspace API. If everyone else says it's fine to break the userspace API
this time, then who am I to object?
