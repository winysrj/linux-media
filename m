Hi Németh,

IMO, the check should, instead, use a max hard limit for the array size.
There's no sense on allowing very large arrays there.

I think that this patch become obsoleted by this one, already merged:


commit 6c06108be53ca5e94d8b0e93883d534dd9079646

    [media] V4L/DVB: v4l2-ioctl: integer overflow in video_usercopy()
    
    If ctrls->count is too high the multiplication could overflow and
    array_size would be lower than expected.  Mauro and Hans Verkuil
    suggested that we cap it at 1024.  That comes from the maximum
    number of controls with lots of room for expantion.
