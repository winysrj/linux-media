As long as copyright notices are retained (and that also includes a
MODULE_AUTHOR: Ezequiel, if you removed that than you should put it
back and add a second MODULE_AUTHOR with your name), then you are free
to do so if the code is licensed under a GPL.

It's legal for the GPL license since that gives explicit permission.

Wrong. As long as the original code is distributed as GPL you can
certainly take it, fix it and ask for it to be merged.

This happens all the time if the original author has left the scene, or has
no time or interest to follow-up on his patches.

In this particular case I've asked Ezequiel to put back the functionality
that he removed, since I thought that was a reasonable compromise (i.e.
you're both unhappy, so that's only half the misery for each :-) ).

For future reference: if someone posts code to a kernel mailinglist and does
not fix any comments made on the code in, let's say, 1-2 months, then
someone else might just step in. Once posted you lose control over your
code (they are kernel drivers, so always GPL). Normally nobody wants to
take over the code unless no visible progress is made for a few months.

Anyway, what's done is done.
