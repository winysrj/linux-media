Sounds really good, but it might be really hard to implemnt, at least for
CMA, because it needs to tweak parameters of memory management internal 
structures very early, when buddy allocator has not been activated yet.

I'm not sure we can solve all such issues in the first version. Maybe we should
first have each of the above fully working in mainline separately and then
start the integration works.
