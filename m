Let's be realistic: if an application doesn't test for error codes,
then that's the problem of the application. Also, EBUSY will only be
returned if someone else is holding the tuner in a different mode.
And that didn't work anyway (and probably in worse ways too if the
driver would forcefully change the tuner mode).

So I really don't see a problem with this.

Absolutely not an option for v4l2. You should always be able to open
a v4l2 device, regardless of the tuner mode or any other mode.

The only exception is a radio tuner device: that should take the tuner
on open. I think this is a very unfortunate design and I wish that that
could be dropped.

One thing that we haven't looked at at all is what should be done if
the current input is not a tuner but a composite or S-Video input.

It is likely (I would have to test this to be sure) that you can capture
from a DVB tuner and at the same time from an S-Video input without any
problems. By taking the tuner token unconditionally this would become
impossible. But doing this right will require more work.

BTW, what happens if the analog video part of a hybrid board doesn't have
a tuner but only S-Video/Composite inputs? I think I've seen such boards
actually. I would have to dig through my collection though.

Nack from me. Taking a tuner token should only happen when the device
actually needs the tuner. For DVB that's easy, since whenever you open
the frontend you *know* you want the tuner.

But that's much more difficult for V4L2 since there are so many combinations,
including many that don't need a tuner at all such as HDMI, Composite etc.

S_PRIORITY has nothing to do with tuner ownership. If there is a real need
to release the token at another time than on close (and I don't see
such a need), then make a new ioctl. Let's not overload S_PRIO with an
unrelated action.

Good examples are cx23885 (already vb2) and cx88 (the vb2 patches have
been posted, but not yet merged). It shouldn't be too hard to find
hardware based on those chipsets.

As mentioned, Nack for the simpler approach from me. That's simply
too simple :-)

Note: I'm travelling and attending a conference, so my availability for
the rest of the week will probably be limited.
