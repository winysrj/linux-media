Because c37db91f were a first attempt. I was expecting that it would be enough,
but, after some discussions at the ML, it seemed to be better to use a different
approach. As you probably noticed, the locking schema at bttv driver were very
complex, and it were likely to ask for problems. The new schema is simpler. The
principle is to serialize the access to the hardware or to the hardware-mirrored
data. It does that by serializing the access to all file operations for a given
bttv device.

While this is a little overkill (as there are a very few set of operations that
won't require locking, like retrieving some static read-only data), there's no
performance impact at the critical path, as such ioctl's typically happen only
during hardware discovery phase at the userspace apps.

I'll intend to add it today for -next, and send upstream by Sunday, hopefully
in time for .37.

Yes, sure. Thanks for the patch.
