Hello list,

Could anyone point me to some good starting points for getting V4L2 running
with eclipse and QT4? I'm trying to get some video processing running on a
video stream from a tv tuner card. The card works with e.g. xawtv, but now I
want to get started with a simple grab the video and put it on the screen
type of app in c++.
Does anyone have some sample code lying around that I could get started
with? Or maybe a good online tutorial?
I've been searching a lot but can't seem to find the right entry for getting
started with this.

Cheers!
Tom
