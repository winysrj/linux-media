I have a saa7146 card but I'm not sure the maker 

02:0c.0 Multimedia controller: Philips Semiconductors SAA7146 (rev 01)
        Subsystem: Device 434a:4343
        Flags: bus master, medium devsel, latency 32, IRQ 11
        Memory at ff7ffc00 (32-bit, non-prefetchable) [size=512]

02:0d.0 Multimedia controller: Philips Semiconductors SAA7146 (rev 01)
        Subsystem: Device 434a:4343
        Flags: bus master, medium devsel, latency 32, IRQ 11
        Memory at ff7ff800 (32-bit, non-prefetchable) [size=512]

the card isn't working and nothing is showing up as /dev/video

It looks like dmesg mentions something about a video capture card but
I'm not sure what to make of it ...
[  448.141499] Linux video capture interface: v2.0

What driver do I need to install to get this to work?  Do you have
another recomendation for a card that "just works". I need it to have
vga.
