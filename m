I agree. What I do on those cases is to have a simple platform_device
for the core IP driver and use platform_device_id tables to do runtime
checks of the small differences. If one platform X doesn't use a
platform_bus, it uses e.g. PCI, then you make a PCI "bridge" which
allocates a platform_device with the correct name and adds that to the
driver model.

See [1] (for the core driver) and [2] (for a PCI bridge driver) for an
example of what I'm talking about.

do they share any address space ? If they do, then you'd need something
to synchronize, right ? If they don't, then you just add two separate
devices, they don't have to be MFD.

I don't think so. That's not really an MFD device is it ? It's just two
different IPs instantianted on the same ASIC/FPGA, right ? Unless they
share the register space, IMHO, there's no need to make them MFD.
