Your best bet would be the 1600.   The 2200 has been on hold for way too
long.    I was going to get a 2200, and opted for the 1800.   The 1800 has
very poor analog support, and I ended up going to the 1600, and they are
working on it right now and support is getting pretty good on it.

Hi Steven,<br>
<br>
We (a friend and i) need to replace a PVR-500, and these are apparently<br>
no longer on the market. Replacement seems to be the HVR-2200. Some<br>
months ago you stated some progress.<br>
<br>
Is this progress yet at the point that analogue testers are usefull for<br>
you? For us the HVR-2200 would be used in analogue mode only, as on<br>
cable we do not have FTA digital signals.<br>
<br>
<br>
Cheers,<br>
