Well, if the driver does not return the resolution it is actually
capturing in, then that indeed is a driver bug.  That's a different
issue though than what your patch proposed.

You should make the TRY_FMT call specifying an invalid resolution and
see if it returns the real resolution the device will capture at.  If
it doesn't, then fix *that* bug.

The application needs to know the capturing resolution, so it's
possible that it does properly handle the driver passing back the real
resolution and the driver is at fault, in which case no change is
needed to the app at all.
