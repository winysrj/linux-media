Hi all,

We're organizing this year's media summit to happen together with the
Embedded Linux Conference - Europe, on Thursday, October 25 2018:

	https://events.linuxfoundation.org/events/elc-openiot-europe-2018/

Media Summit is the premier forum to discuss the Linux multimedia
development for cameras, audio and video streaming devices,
analog/digital TV support, remote controller and HDMI Consumer
Electronics Control (CEC) at the Linux Kernel and its related 
userspace APIs.

The ones interested on participating on it should be registered
at ELC or OSS Europe, and indicate the participation at the media
summit via Linux Foundation's register site:

	https://events.linuxfoundation.org/events/elc-openiot-europe-2018/register/

We're also asking for the themes to be discussed there. Please
send your proposals to the linux-media@vger.kernel.org mailing
list. In order to make easier for us to track, please add a
[RFP] at the beginning of the email's subject.

Hoping to see you there,

Regards,
Mauro
