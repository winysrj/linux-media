Btw, a bad side effect of using the negative sign is that enabling debug will
present those messages, showing negative number of units and time to the poor user:

[42889.320163] ir_rc5_decode: RC5(x) decode started at state 1 (-1 units, -816us)
[42889.320166] ir_rc6_decode: RC6 decode started at state 0 (-2 units, -816us)
[42889.320169] ir_rc6_decode: RC6 decode failed at state 0 (-2 units, -816us)

It seems we need a debug macro also.
