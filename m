They're nevertheless interesting, since I'm in a similar position: my 
vdr machine is using (almost flawlessly) a Skystar 2 (though I don't 
believe in this new fangled disecq thing and I use an old fashioned 
actuator to move my dish) and it's running a 2.6.17 kernel.
I'll probably have to update one day (especially if I want to keep up 
with the "latest and greatest" vdr), but I'm not really in a hurry, even 
less so seeing your problems.

Bye
