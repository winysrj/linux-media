Juhana,

I do not believe there is any shortage of people willing to suggest
features for the various applications.  We *do* however need people
who can actually implement those features.  Demanding that certain
things that you think are important "should be solved immediately" is
probably not the best way to get open source developers to help you
out.

Regarding the DVB subtitle support, I believe Kaffeine supports them.

Devin
