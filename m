Interesting, so you burst write multi-word descriptor writes using
write-combining here for the Ethernet device.

How big are the descriptors?

Interesting, thanks, yeah using this as a work around to the problem sounds
plausible however it still would require likely making just as many changes to
the ivtv and ipath driver as to just do a proper split. I do wonder however if
this sort of work around can be generalized somehow though so that others could
use, if this sort of thing is going to become prevalent. If so then this would
serve two purposes: work around for the corner cases of MTRR use on Linux and
also these sorts of device constraints.

In order to determine if this is likely to be generally useful could you elaborate
a bit more about the detals of the performance issues of not bursting writes
for the descriptor on this device.

Even if that is done a conversion over to this work around seems it may require
device specific nitpicks. For instance I note in myri10ge_submit_req() for
small writes you just do a reverse write and do the first set last, then
finally the last 32 bits are rewritten, I guess to trigger something?

I think it should but the more interesting question would be exactly
*why* it was needed for this device, who determined that, and why?
