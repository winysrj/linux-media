Hi Barry, thanks for taking the time to reply (my previous more 
informative post was ignored).

This is the Terrestrial transmission standard being rolled out across 
the UK, I live in one of the first areas to be upgraded to the new 
standard. Since the change, my DVB-T PCI card will no longer tune 
(despite the signal level being indicated as OK in Kaffeine). I have 
confirmed the card does work correctly under Windows XP with the 
original card software, so it does not appear to be a hardware issue. I 
have tried numerous apps and various kernels, all without success. Any 
guidance as to what to try next, be it how to gather info for a bug 
report, or even a solution :), would be greatly appreciated.
