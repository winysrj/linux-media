Well, probably it is related to the audio output and not audio
capture (or the application you're looking into is an hybrid one).

That's simple: it should stop streaming, as part of the hardware can
be powered off. It can only return opening the device after DVB
releases.

Ok. After that, we can proceed with the token patch v3, or to see if
it is possible to use the media controller here, as Sakari suggested.
