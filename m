Hi Philipp,

2a38014: 010D07DF 00040596

        SA  EA         SB  EB  SB  EB
D07DF: 001 101 (0000) 011 111 011 111 (field 0)
40596: 000 100 (0000) 010 110 010 110 (field 1)

The codes apparently are 1=EAV (0=SAV), field#, 1=blanking.
Now BT.656 doesn't say a word about top and bottom fields. There are
just fields 1 and 2. So yes, the CCIR_CODE* registers currently seem to
swap the fields. It also depends on the ADV7180 sending correct codes
based on the even/odd analog fields. Interesting.

Exactly.
Especially if the complete frame is then passed straight to the display,
with the user treating it as progressive (which it isn't anymore).

Well, the entire frame would shift up a line, the bottom "field" would
become top and vice versa. This would effectively make BT->TB and TB->BT.

Yes.

Exactly.
