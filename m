I understand you are saying that teletext is not encrypted on satelite 
broadcasting aimed for the Netherlands.
P. van Gaans understood from my problems that I must be living in the 
Netherlands. As teletext on Digitenne is encrypted contrary to what is 
normally done.
So you are talking about DVB-S (Canal digital) while I'm talking about DVB-T 
(Digitenne).
