Subject: [PATCH v2 0/9] phy: Add configuration interface for MIPI D-PHY devices
Date: Tue,  6 Nov 2018 15:54:12 +0100

Hi,

Here is a set of patches to allow the phy framework consumers to test and
apply runtime configurations.

This is needed to support more phy classes that require tuning based on
parameters depending on the current use case of the device, in addition to
the power state management already provided by the current functions.

A first test bed for that API are the MIPI D-PHY devices. There's a number
of solutions that have been used so far to support these phy, most of the
time being an ad-hoc driver in the consumer.

That approach has a big shortcoming though, which is that this is quite
difficult to deal with consumers integrated with multiple variants of phy,
of multiple consumers integrated with the same phy.

The latter case can be found in the Cadence DSI bridge, and the CSI
transceiver and receivers. All of them are integrated with the same phy, or
can be integrated with different phy, depending on the implementation.

I've looked at all the MIPI DSI drivers I could find, and gathered all the
parameters I could find. The interface should be complete, and most of the
drivers can be converted in the future. The current set converts two of
them: the above mentionned Cadence DSI driver so that the v4l2 drivers can
use them, and the Allwinner MIPI-DSI driver.

Let me know what you think,
Maxime

Changes from v1:
  - Rebased on top of 4.20-rc1
  - Removed the bus mode and timings parameters from the MIPI D-PHY
    parameters, since that shouldn't have any impact on the PHY itself.
  - Reworked the Cadence DSI and D-PHY drivers to take this into account.
  - Remove the mode parameter from phy_configure
  - Added phy_configure and phy_validate stubs
  - Return -EOPNOTSUPP in phy_configure and phy_validate when the operation
    is not implemented
