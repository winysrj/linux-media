> You will notice that the kernel I have used is 3.7.4. I hope that's a suitable kernel for your tests. I've moved away from the 3.8 development kernel onto one that's stable and on which Martin has identified a solution. I see Greg KH released 3.7.5 yesterday and it includes a pciehp change. I'll upgrade to that, run the tests again and report back.

Hi Chris,
   pci_slot driver is not necessary, I think empty directory under /sys/bus/pci_express/devices is the main problem,
Because no pcie port devices found in the system, so pciehp driver can not bind any devices when loading it.
Then no slot will created under /sys/bus/pci/devices/slots.
