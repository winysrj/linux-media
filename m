I've found this as the most relevant reference:

================================================================================
The ADV7481 HDMI capable receiver supports a maximum pixel clock frequency of
162 MHz, allowing HDTV formats up to 1080p, and display resolutions up to UXGA
(1600 Ã— 1200 at 60 Hz). The device integrates a consumer electronics control
(CEC) controller that supports the capability discovery and control (CDC)
feature. The HDMI input port has dedicated 5 V detect and Hot PlugTM assert pins.
================================================================================

So that certainly looks like 162 MHz is the correct value.

>> Besides, you need a bit of margin since detected pixelclock rates can be a bit off.

Does that mean you would you recommend adding 0.5 MHz to the 162 MHz in a
similar way as the minimum, or keep at 162 MHz ?

(I'm assuming stay at 162 MHz, as the 7604 is set at 225MHz)
