Hi,
I'm looking for a new DVB-S2 card for my linux server and I wonder if
anyone have tried the TeVii S470 in linux with DVB-S and S2 and whats
the status of it. Is it stable and good support, no problems like the 
TT3200 (A problem with locking high symbol rate channels (DVB-S2 30000
3/4 transponders) .
I need to tune channels with a high symbolrate at 30000.
It does not say much in linuxtv-wiki but the manufacturer has s2api
driver at there homepage.

How is it compared to Hauppauge HVR-4000, Nova HD S2 or the TT S2 1600?

Thankful for all help.

Best regards
Claes
