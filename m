I am certain it is the configuration of the second frontend that ripples
through Afatech devices.

I have only got a single AF9015 device so can't test the dual
configuration.

Does the same problems exist when running the second frontend solo or

With the IT1937(aka AF9035) the second frontend appeared not to work at
all in Windows in dual mode.
