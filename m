David,

It really doesn't say anything about the credibility of the
developers, other than that perhaps they are already severely
overloaded and don't have the cycles to create a setup such as the one
you are proposing.

This is unlikely to happen not because it's not technically possible,
but because the developers have other stuff that is more important to
be working on.

Devin
