Hello,

I'm sorry for the delay. Just got back from my holidays and getting thought
the mails.

Right, otherwise it wouldn't really make much sense. Note that our proposal

I understand that this requires a lot of work, but I still think this might
be possible to get it working with some additional constraints.

I understand that modifying L1 page tables is definitely not a proper way of
handling this. It simply costs too much. But what if we consider that the DMA
memory can be only allocated from a specific range of the system memory?
Assuming that this range of memory is known during the boot time, it CAN be
mapped with two-level of tables in MMU. First level mapping will stay the
same all the time for all processes, but it would be possible to unmap the
pages required for DMA from the second level mapping what will be visible
from all the processes at once.

Is there any reason why such solution won't work?

Best regards
