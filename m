Last night (well, actually the wee wee hours of this morning), I took 
the time to:
- add a news announcement regarding media_build on the front page of the 
wiki
- update the  
http://www.linuxtv.org/wiki/index.php/How_to_Obtain,_Build_and_Install_V4L-DVB_Device_Drivers 
article accordingly

I suspect that what has precluded any earlier case of a widely visible 
announcement being made, beyond those tidbits that have appeared on the 
mailing list, is a combination of:
- the necessity for having someone actually find and take time to 
perform such an administrative task
- and, amongst most, a case of general unfamiliarity  with the new system
- and, a question of maintainership of the new system and whether or not 
its status is still classified as experimental or has reached maturity
- and, access rights required to modify the Linuxtv proper website in 
regards to these developments

Speaking of time, I've now expended all of mine, and then some (as per 
usual), which I can devote to this matter.  Hopefully someone can take a 
look and correct any mistakes I've made or add any points I've 
overlooked on the wiki.   As well, hopefully someone else can take care 
of the other parts of the website that need to be updated.
