Hi All,

Recently, quite some people have been requesting for scan-s2 a simple
scan application which has been hacked on top of the scan application
as available in the dvb-apps tree, to be integrated/pulled in to the
dvb-apps tree, after it's author moved on to other arenas.

http://www.mail-archive.com/vdr@linuxtv.org/msg11125.html

The idea initially was to have a cloned copy of scan as scan-s2.
Now, on the other hand scan-s2 is much more like scan and similar
functionality wise too.

Considering the aspects, do you think, that it is worthwhile to have

a) the scan-s2 application and the scan application as well integrated
into the repository, such that they both live together

or

b) scan-s2 does things almost the same as scan2. scan can be replaced
by scan-s2.


What are your ideas/thoughts on this ?

Regards,
Manu
