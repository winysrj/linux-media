Hello

As we discussed in the mini-summit I am interested in upstreaming an
API for Dead Pixels.

Since it is not viable to push my camera code, I would like to add it
to an already supported camera.

On the summit somebody mention a board that also has hardware support
for Dead Pixels, but the driver did not support it. If my memory is
right it was a beagle board plus a sensor board.

Could somebody point me to the right hardware to buy ?

Thanks!
