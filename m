To be more general (sensor clocked by MCLK or not), I think we should  
request the sensor its PCLK, by adding a get_pclk member in  
soc_camera_ops for example.
Then CITOR value can be computed.
On the sensor side, PCLK value can be defined in its platform data. I  
agree this is redundant for a MT9V022 clocked by MCLK but to my point  
of view, this is not the general case.
