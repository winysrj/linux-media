That is the weak point of linux in general, in my case I can't
capture, edit and process DV video using linux, TS I doesn't even
count. In windows I have virtualdub and avisynth (with plugins) to do
whatever I need to process any capture type.

Since I got to know Linux OS (your linux OS brand here) back in 1996
not much was made so you can switch 100% from windows to linux. Yes,
today linux is much more easy to handle for a normal user, back in the
days we had to compile the kernel at the installation process, compile
your drivers and so on, but even today if you need some specific tools
in Linux that is trivial in Windows like virtualdub, avisynth (others)
you don't have it.

Make a dual boot installation to use windows based tools to do your basic work.
