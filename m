What is the status of ISDB-Tb / ISDB-T International / ISDB Japanese 
closed captioning support?

If anyone is working on this, please get in touch -- we're particularly 
interested in getting Brazilian SBTVD working.

I see Mauro has been working on DVBv5 support, but does this include 
captioning?

Cheers,
David
