Looks like you need pid filtering on, but if you force the pid filter
on, it won't work because there is no functions setup for it on the
driver for the second frontend.

btw, you need to force the pid filter on at boot time, add a line in
file.

/etc/modules (or  /etc/modules.preload) 

dvb_usb force_pid_filter_usage=1

Otherwise, it keeps going off.

But, it will only work on the first frontend(adapter). It works fine on
my single one.
