Right, I should have made clearer that this is just a rework of Hans'
original RFC in [1].

I'll test this with i.MX PXP and IPU mem2mem drivers and follow up with
per-driver patches to enable this feature once we know where this should
be going.

In that case, I think the V4L2_PIX_FMT_FLAG_CSC_* should be purely a
signal from the application to the driver, and the driver should not
(have to) touch them at all.

An equivalent set of v4l2_fmtdesc flags could be used to signal
conversion support via VIDIOC_ENUM_FMT:

#define V4L2_FMT_FLAG_CSC_COLORSPACE	0x0004
#define V4L2_FMT_FLAG_CSC_YCBCR_ENC	0x0008
#define V4L2_FMT_FLAG_CSC_HSV_ENC	0x0008
#define V4L2_FMT_FLAG_CSC_QUANTIZATION	0x0010
#define V4L2_FMT_FLAG_CSC_XFER_FUNC	0x0020

What is the expected use case for these reported flags? Applications
that see them set to zero can skip enumerating capture side colorimetry.
Is there anything else?

I'd say no. Drivers are free to silently ignore the flag.
The effect is the same as if the driver supports the flag in principle,
but has to change a requested value anyway because of some limitation.
The application can check whether the driver changed its requested
colorspace, xfer_func, ycbcr_enc, or quantization.

The application usually doesn't need to know whether the driver changed
the requested ycbcr_enc because it doesn't have CSC matrix support at
all, or because it doesn't implement a specific conversion. And if the
application needs to know for some reason, it can always check
VIDIOC_ENUM_FMT.

The only drivers using V4L2_PIX_FMT_FLAG_PREMUL_ALPHA I can see are
vsp1_brx and vsp1_rpf. They never write to the v4l2_pix_format flags
field.

Isn't this useless to introduce after the fact, if there are already
applications that use this feature? They can't depend on the existence
of this flag to check for support anyway.

I'd just say the driver is free to ignore the flag if it doesn't support
the specific requested value and leave it at that.
