Indeed. Hm, about whether the patch is needed.. What happened here was: the module
didn't get loaded w/o the patch. But then maybe something else made the change? 
After subsequent reboot the module did get loaded. Hm..

Isn't the vendor/product ID a point of reference that tells the kernel which module
to load when supported hw is found? That was the idea behind adding the ID and
submitting the patch. 

Thanks for clarification.

        Cheers, 

                  Nils
