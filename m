It seems that that depends, on my system gvfs isn't actually automounting the 
camera after it detects it and the file is only open (according to lsof) when 
the device is actually mounted. As soon as you unmount it the device gets 
closed again. Because it does do a brief open,  USBDEVFS_DISCONNECT then close 
at connection time it does still disable the kernel driver.

This does seem like a situation where your approach could potentially give a 
better user experience. I'm wondering slightly how you define busy though. For 
webcams the streamon and streamoff ioctls tell you if you are using mmap or 
userptr transfers but you don't know if when the user has finished if they 
just use read. For stillcam mode it is again hard to determine a busy 
condition other than being in the middle of transfering an individual picture.

This again needs a usable concept of busy

Would such a system know what camera is supposed to be the internal one so it 
doesn't show the camera as turned on just because you plug in an external 
camera. If so then it won't turn on and off as an external camera changes 
modes. If not then showing on when any camera is usable and off when it isn't 
seems like sensible behaviour.

I think in summary I'm concerned about the possibility of perfect being the 
enemy of good enough. At the moment we've got a significant usability problem 
(a web search for gvfs-gphoto2-volume-monitor turns up mostly instructions on 
how to disable it). If we come up with a solution that whilst it would be 
perfect there isn't enough effort available to implement then that is worse 
than a solution that fixes most of the problem. This is an even greater 
concern when the technically superior solution has a higher long term 
maintenance overhead (as we no longer get Win32 and OSX users helping to 
maintain the stillcam drivers).

I'm not sure if there is anything in this discussion that is relevant to the 
cameras in phones or tablets. These appear to the user as if they are dual 
mode devices but they don't have any independent storage - taking a photo is 
more like capturing a single higher than usual res frame so I suspect they 
aren't going to be an issue.
