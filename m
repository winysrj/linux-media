All pages from [start, pfn) have passed through the loop body which
means that they are valid and they have been removed from buddy (for
caller's use).  Also, because of split_free_page(), all of those pages
have been split into 0-order pages.  Therefore, in error recovery, to
undo what the loop has done so far, we put give back to buddy by
calling __free_page() on each 0-order page.

To be clear, I meant that the CMA expects pages to be in buddy when the function
is called but after the function finishes, all the pages in the range are removed
 from buddy.  This, among other things, is why the call to split_free_page() is
necessary.
