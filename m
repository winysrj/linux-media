Russell,

I started to use your code (which works fine, thanks), and it avoids a
lot of problems, especially, about probe_defer in a DT context.

I was wondering if your componentised mechanism could be extended to the
devices defined by DT.

In the DT, when a device_node is a phandle, this means it is referenced
by some other device(s), and these device(s) will not start until the
phandle device is registered.

Then, the idea is to do a component_add() for such phandle devices in
device_add() (device_register).

Pratically,

- the component_add() call in device_register would not include any
  bind/unbind callback function, so, this should be tested in
  component_bind/unbind(),

- component_add would not be called if the device being added already
  called component_add in its probe function. A simple flag in the
  struct device_node should solve this problem.

What do you think about this?
