These StarTech devices seemed to be based on the empia 28xx + SAA71xx chipset devices which have some support in the linux kernel.  Unfortunately, we are having trouble with the StarTech devices in Linux.  Does anyone on this list know of anyone in the linxtv.org (or related) community that might be willing to help us modify a current driver to enable the StarTech device(s)?  Or, do you know of anyone who currently works with analog video capture hardware in linux who might be willing to provide other ideas?

Please try what Hans has proposed. Then come back to here and post what
is your current state.
Please keep me in CC when you post. I would like to help.
Where can one buy online the exact device you're talking about?
