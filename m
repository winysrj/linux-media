I'm actually concerned about this trend.  Downgrading things to WARN_ON
can allow a security bug in the kernel to continue to exist, for
example, or make the error message disappear.

I am wondering if the right thing here isn't to have a user (command
line?) settable policy as to how to proceed on an assert violation,
instead of hardcoding it at compile time.
