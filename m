I forgot to comment about that on the last e-mail. 

A solution close to the above one were already proposed:
	http://www.spinics.net/lists/vfl/msg25707.html

There were also another proposal there that might solve:
	http://www.spinics.net/lists/vfl/msg25702.html


Something like:

#if sizeof(enum) == 1
	typedef u8	__enum_t;
#elif sizeof(enum) == 2
	typedef u16	__enum_t;
#elif sizeof(enum) == 4
	typedef u32	__enum_t;
#elif sizeof(enum) == 8
	typedef u64	__enum_t;
#else
	typedef enum __enum_t;
#endif

Can actually work. Not sure if I really like adding a typedef, but maybe
this is the less dirty way to fix it.

We'll need to properly test the v4l2-compat32 code, as it will need 
to handle a different enum size on userspace. So, there, we'll likely
need to replace every enum with just "u32". Hmm... arm with 64 bits
(if/when added) may be an additional issue for the compat stuff.

Mauro
