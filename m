Hi all,

This second patch series updates this driver to the control framework,
switches it to unlocked_ioctl and fixes a variety of V4L2 compliance issues.

This patch series has been tested by Arvydas Sidorenko. Thank you!

I also like to thank Jose GÃ³mez who also did some testing for me.

Changes in this second patch series:

- The first patch is new and fixes a bug introduced by commit
  7a29ee2e37b3f9675f46c87998c67b68c315c54a ("stk-webcam: Add an upside down
  dmi table, and add the Asus G1 to it").
- Patches 10-12 are also new and fix some more bugs found when running
  the compliance tests.

If there are no more comments then I intend to post the pull request on Friday.

Regards,

        Hans
