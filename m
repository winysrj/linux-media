I had feared so. It's a bit unfortunate as the series is a dependency for a 
DRM pull request I want to send for v4.6. That's not a very big deal, but it 
will mean we will have to provide a stable branch. Could I ask you to merge it 
early after the merge window closes to give me enough time to deal with the 
DRM side ?
