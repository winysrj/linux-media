OK, so given that its still early, monday and I haven't actually spend
much time thinking on this; would it be possible to make:
ww_mutex_lock(.ctx=NULL) act like ww_mutex_lock_single()?

The idea is that if we don't provide a ctx, we'll get a different
lockdep annotation; mutex_lock() vs mutex_lock_nest_lock(). So if we
then go and make a mistake, lockdep should warn us.

Would that work or should I stock up on morning juice?
