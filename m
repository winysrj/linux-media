Wherever it came from, the patch is incorrect. Anyone can throw in
any patch as they want.

What you are stating is a hit and miss scenario, sometimes it might lock
and sometimes it wouldn't.

The scanning algorithm that I implemented for the demodulator works
with a symbol rate as low as 5 MSPS alone. Anything lower than that
is hit and miss.

How can you be sure ? I myself am not very sure. While we worked on
the demodulator in the early days, we had different situations where a
previous failed state could cause lockup of the demodulator, eventually
resulting tuning failures.

The frontend allows a different lower symbol rate with a different
scanning algorithm, not with this existing current one.

I am pretty sure, that author saw some specifications written some
place and simply copied those numbers in here. Also sure that he
has no idea about the algorithm in use.

According to ST itself, a 2MSPS algorithm was created for a very
specific customer requirement, which is not applicable to the existing
algorithm in use with the Linux STB0899 demodulator driver.
