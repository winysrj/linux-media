Hi Laurent,

Thanks for looping me into this email chain, and apologies about not
responding earlier; it just got lost in the barrage of things.

Yes, +1 on that.

The problem posed here is similar in the sense of requirement of
conveying memory constraints, but the key is probably the reverse
direction - the userspace here *needs* to share constraints of
_buffers_ obtained from elsewhere.

So I've been (trying to) work out some way of conveying memory
constraints between devices, and our idea was to get that added to
struct device->dma_parameters; that ways, the userspace doesn't have
to necessarily know of the constraints, and some negotiation can
happen in the kernel itself. It doesn't at the moment concern with
taking care of sharing those back to userspace, but I think that's an
orthogonal thing to handle.

Absolutely, it'd be great if we can come up with some aligned way of
conveying these constraints.
