For real time applications it does make a big difference - decisions
taken at the application level can greatly impact end application
performance.  For example with VoIP on a LAN you can get great audio
quality by using very little compression at the expense of high
bandwidth and you can probably use a very small jitter buffer.  Try
doing that over a longer distance or more congested network which drops
packets and it becomes useful to use a more commpressed encoding for
your data which may have better features for handling packet loss, or to
increase your jitter buffer to cope with the less reliable transmit
times.
