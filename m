Sorry for answering that late, I hadn't seen your answer.

I've tried several drivers and several distris, but either the
compilation fails because of the kernel version, or the kernel is
crashing when loading the driver, so I'm still not able to use my tv
card :(. Actually I'm using a 4.3er kernel with Debian unstable.

I'll write to TeVii again, maybe they'll offer me a solution.

I think I forgot writing the result of $ lspci, here is it:
$ lspci
...
03:00.0 Multimedia video controller: Conexant Systems, Inc. CX23885 PCI
Video and Audio Decoder (rev 04)
...

If anyone has an idea how to get it work, I'm still interested in a
solution.

Regards, Hendrik
