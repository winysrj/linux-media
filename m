Hello all,

I'm finally happy to announce that we've got a working version of the
drx-j driver (with the appropriate licensing) and I'm looking for
testers if you happen to own an PCTV 80e.

More details as to where to find the tree and how to install it can be
found here:

Feedback welcome (either here or in the blog post comments)

Thanks go out to Trident Microsystems for finally allowing a driver to
be released, as well as to Hauppauge/PCTV for pushing for its release
for so long.

Cheers,

Devin
