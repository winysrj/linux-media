Sorry, my mistake. In this case mlog() is a macro, not an inline functions.
The effect is the same though.

The stack frame of the function that calls mlog(), yes.

mlog() is placed in the calling function.

KASAN decides that passing a pointer to _m into an extern function
(_mlog_printk) is potentially dangerous, as that function might
keep a reference to that pointer after it goes out of scope,
or it might not know the correct length of the stack object pointed to.

We can see from looking at the __mlog_printk() function definition
that it's actually safe, but the compiler cannot see that when looking
at another source file.

Turning off KASAN fixes the problem, but the entire purpose of
KASAN is to identify code that is potentially dangerous.

This is what happened in 3f181b4d8652 ("lib/Kconfig.debug:
disable -Wframe-larger-than warnings with KASAN=y").

I'm trying to revert that patch so we actually get warnings
again about functions that are still dangerous. I picked 3072
as an arbitrary limit, as there are only a handful of files
that use larger stack frames in the worst case, but we can
only use that limit after fixing up all the warnings it shows.
