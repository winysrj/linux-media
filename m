My opinion hasn't changed since then. I actually wanted an even larger 
change, but it has been shrunk to what we see below. Hans also wanted to 
reorganise Kconfig, so, I hoped, situation would improve after that, but 
it didn't. And with every new kernel new tuner modules get added, which 
automatically get enabled, so, every time I upgrade to a newer kernel I 
have to make sure to deselect them. This doesn't seem a very optimal 
situation to me. BTW, what is stated below (the commit message is not 
completely mine, it has been edited, Mauro, by you?) is also not always 
true: tuner modules are not autoselected by host cards if customisation 
is on. They simply all default to "m" in this case.

Thanks
