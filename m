Subject: [PATCH/RFC 0/6] FM V4L2 driver for WL128x
Date: Fri, 13 Aug 2010 10:14:38 -0400
Message-Id: <1281708884-15462-1-git-send-email-raja_mani@ti.com>

Sender: Mauro Carvalho Chehab <mchehab@pedra>

From: Raja-Mani <x0102026@ti.com>

The following patches are FM V4L2-Radio drivers for WL128x
(backward compatible for WL127x). TI's V4L2 based FM driver 
uses APIs and header files of TI's Shared Transport driver 
that is hosted in "staging/ti-st/" folder.

I request to add TI FM driver to "staging/ti-st/" folder. 
This will help us keep track of changes to TI FM driver.

V4L2 maintainers are fine to review TI FM driver from staging folder. 
Details of discussion can be found at 
http://permalink.gmane.org/gmane.linux.drivers.video-input-infrastructure/20918

Only FM Rx is supported as of now. Any FM V4L2 Radio standard application
can make use of the '/dev/radioX' interface exposed by this driver to
communicate with the TI FM chip.

This has support for RDS, FM firmware download, HW Seek, Tune, 
Volume control,etc.
