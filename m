I heard you were trying to extend your stay to include the Friday. Let me
know if you'll be able to attend this summit and I can add this topic to
the list. If you can't join us on Friday, then we can discuss this on the
Thursday: we should have enough time for that.

I suspect that as long as the core life-time issues aren't solved nothing
much will happen with this. It's like building a house on quicksand.

It wasn't obvious that the foundation was quicksand when you started, but
the realization slowly dawned on us that there were more problems than we
thought. Or at least, this is my understanding.

Regards,
