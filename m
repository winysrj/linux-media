No-go.  According to the syslog, the segfault has not happened
since I reconfigured the kernel and startup sequence two days
ago to resolve an XFS mount issue.

Something in there changed the init timing just enough to make
it go away, I believe.

Now I'm blowing it all away in favour of fresh userspace,
with a whole new set of issues to resolve.  :)

Off-Topic:
Ubuntu (Mythbuntu) really has a ton of timing issues with
this upstart thing at startup and shutdown.. running from an SSD
really exposes the flaws.

Cheers
