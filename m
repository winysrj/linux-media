Doesn't sound like a good idea to me to be passing clock pointers in platform
data (if that's what you mean) or adding additional callbacks there. 
Would such callback be implemented in a board setup file, which are
being phased out in favour of the device tree?

How about internal connections between processing blocks inside SoCs?
Don't we want to also list those here? I mean direct connections
like Preview Engine -> Resizer in TI SoCs or Display Mixer -> Video Capture
Engine in Samsung SoCs.
If there is no all possible bus types in this list I can't see how
driver's for such hardware could be converted to use this new interface. 

Perhaps we could add something like
V4L2_MBUS_INTERNAL or V4L2_MBUS_USER1...?
