yes, should be good enough.

We most likely need the former Pinnacle devs here, if not already fired.
Maybe Mike and Devin can agree these days on it and it seems some
work-flow does recover.

You can have from me all details for the early device I do have now,
after later ones caused more confusion, and of course can use all that
on the wiki.

Let me know, I'll sent photos off list then.

After latest on wiki stuff, I'm for sure not interested to have an
account and was always in doubt, how to separate developer announces and
user reports there.

I did vote for user reports, if in doubt, since you can't match all
conditions, at least for such cards I was involved, and did stay away,
even on worst wrong stuff you sometimes can read there.

Either that wiki idea works or not. In longer terms it should,
but can also become pretty crufty soon.

Cheers,
Hermann
