This is NOT a magic value. The test that's done here is to memset the
format structure with 0xff, then call the ioctl. Afterwards it checks
if there are any remaining 0xff bytes left in the struct since it expects
the driver to have overwritten it by something else. That's where the 0xff
comes from.

I think part of my confusion here is that there are two places where you
deal with colorspaces in a DMA engine: first there is a input pad of the
DMA engine entity, secondly there is the v4l2_pix_format for the memory
description.

The second is set by the driver based on what userspace specified for the
input pad, together with any changes due to additional conversions such
as quantization range and RGB <-> YUV by the DMA engine.

So any colorspace validation is done for the input pad. The question is
what that validation should be. It's never been defined.

Also the handling of COLORSPACE_DEFAULT for pad formats needs to be defined.

This is not the first time this cropped up, see e.g. this RFC patch:

I do not want to relax the test for colorspace for the v4l2_pix_format in
the compliance test. That test is good and should remain.

For the input pad format there are two issues:

1) Setting the initial colorspace information. If you open the v4l-subdev
device then the initial colorspace data is likely all 0. That's wrong for
the colorspace since 0 is not allowed. So init_cfg should set it to something
non-0 (I'd expect either SRGB or RAW). Or perhaps this should be done in the
core as a standard initialization in the absence of the init_cfg op (or before
it is called).

An alternative is to allow a 0 (DEFAULT) value here, but then what do you use
in v4l2_pix_format? That definitely can't be 0. I think I prefer to always
have something explicit here.

2) Validation of the colorspace fields when setting the format on the input pad.
After thinking about this some more I believe that the only reasonable thing
you can do here is to indeed validate it based on the current range of known
colorspaces (or more strict of course if the hardware has limitations).

But rather than adding validate defines I would just add something like this
to the colorspace enum:

	/* Update when a new colorspace is added */
	V4L2_COLORSPACE_LAST        = V4L2_COLORSPACE_DCI_P3

and do the same for the other colorspace-related enums.

In v4l2-subdev.c you can then check and validate this. Anything out-of-range
would map to COLORSPACE_SRGB/RAW or 0 (DEFAULT) for the other fields.

I think SRGB is best here since it is the most widely used and understood
colorspace.

Another issue is pipeline validation. See the link to the RFC patch above.
The biggest issue here is that filling in these fields has been hit-and-miss
and you don't want things to suddenly fail.

If the core validates/initializes these fields, then at least we always see
something valid here (i.e. never 0 or > V4L2_COLORSPACE_LAST for the colorspace).
I'd have to think about it some more.

This whole mess once again shows the importance of good compliance tests, especially
for complex APIs like this. It forces you to think about how this should be handled
instead of doing some vague hand-waving.
