This allocator is needed because some device (like STA2X11 VIP) cannot work 
with DMA sg or DMA coherent. Some other device (like the one used by Jonathan 
when he proposes vb2-dma-nc allocator) can obtain much better performance with 
DMA streaming than coherent.

I did not modify vb2-dma-contig because I was thinking that each DMA memory 
allocator should reflect a DMA API.

I did not write all this details because the reasons to use vb2-dma-contig, 
vb2-dma-sg or vb2-dma-streaming are the same reasons because someone choose 
SG, coherent or streaming API. This is already documented in the DMA-*.txt 
files, so I did not rewrite it to avoid duplication.
