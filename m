Hei Antti,

I picked this thread up from the web archive at
http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.linux.drivers.video-input-infrastructure/18690/focus=19258

I too have  an Aver A835 DVB-T USB Stick and was wondering if it can be 
supported, after a thorough search I didn't find evidence in the web to 
support that, so I thought I might reopen the thread.

I checked the Windows driver .inf file as per your suggestion and can 
confirm that AF9035 appears to be the chipset. What steps are needed to 
get this supported? I am not afraid to patch my kernel and test whether 
it works, unfortunately I can't create such a patch by myself.

I have the hardware at hand and am willing to support you in every way 
possible (Preferarbly without harming the device :-) ). What more 
information would you need?

Greetings
Malte Z.
