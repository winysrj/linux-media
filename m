Not to my disappointment.  I'm glad to hear it.  Someone who appears to
have an EE background without corporate bias can be an asset to the
community.

Then what I perceived was wrong.  My apologies.

I was aware you were away.  For what dates I do not know (I have emails
from you in May 2008).  For what reasons, I do not know for sure (nor do
I feel is it my business).

Not entirely, there is a basis for the timing point.  The pull requests
seemed to have come in short order when confronted with a competing
proposal.  Yet the project had been ongoing for at least over a year (as
far as I can ascertain).  Here's a gripe about delays from Jan 2008:
http://www.mail-archive.com/linux-dvb@linuxtv.org/msg28606.html

There seemed to have been no other visible motivation for the pull
requests except competition.

OK, then you do have some high ground.  But you also had essentially a
monopoly position and now you have competition.  That is not crap.

No, you are mud slinging.  Let's count the derogatory terms you use in
addressing your competition in the following quote:

"No need for you to break the compliant devices in favour of your
mediocre cards. As i wrote just above, the STB0899 is not the only one
device using the said features. Also i can guarantee that the CX24116
(HVR4000) is the most handicapped DVB-S2 device that you are basing the
DVB-S2 API on: and i can guarantee that what you do will be just be
broken as you have done for other devices in the past."

"Also i do not understand, why you have to make a lot of noise to port
the STB0899 drivers to your crap, when all your cards work as expected
by you with the multiproto tree. I don't see any reason why the STB0899
has to be ported to the handicapped API of yours, handicapping the
STB0899 based devices."


1 mediocre
3 handicap (or variation thereof)
1 crap
2 break (or variation thereof) when referring to competing work
1 noise, when referring to another offer to do work competing work

And that's just part of the email.  I'd hate to read when you actually
claim to be mud-slinging.

Andy
