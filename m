On that note, the interrupt was being disabled, just not it's value in the
register.  What I was actually seeing was it combined with one of the others.

Hmm. Via a bit of reordering of writes and a temporary disable, it now does one frame,
then about a 100ms pause, then continues with 50ms blanking periods, vs, about 18ms of
data transfer.  Still running into what looks like the same issue with the ccdc getting
wedged...

Having introduced some debugging into the isr I get:

Repeat last 4 lines ad infinitum or if lucky till my program gives up
and closes everything.  Sometimes that hangs the machine as well.

So nothing obviously changing. Waveform of the vsync signal looks right to
me.

The other fun wedge that sometimes happens is both vd0 and vd1 occur together.
Not sure what can be done about that one. It tends to occur after a are occasion
where I actually get as far as closing the dev in a previous run.  (i.e. something
is wrong in my shutdown of the device).
