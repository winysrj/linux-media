I don't know if I'd call it a strong use-case, as much as a good
worst-case to consider

well.. I guess I don't see how it would be easier in the kernel than
in userspace ;-)

But if you can come up with a good way to add it to dev->dma_params
that everyone can agree on, I don't mind.  I suppose I'm starting with
the assumption that it will be difficult/impossible to get everyone to
agree on this, but I don't mind being proved wrong.

I guess I don't object to mmap being a slow path (as long is it
doesn't end up requiring a slow path on hw where this otherwise
wouldn't be needed).
