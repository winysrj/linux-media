Hi Russell, everyone,

First up, sincere apologies for being awol for sometime; had some
personal / medical things to take care of, and then I thought I'd wait
for the merge window to get over before beginning to discuss this
again.

So, for basic constraint-sharing, we'll just go with the flag based
approach, with a flag (best place for it is still dev->dma_params I
suppose) for denoting contiguous or scatterlist. Is that agreed, then?
Also, with this idea, of course, there won't be any helpers for trying
to calculate constraints; it would be totally the exporter's
responsibility to handle it via the attach() dma_buf_op if it wishes
to.

+1 for Keep it simple, and the idea overall. Though I suspect more
dma-buf users (dri / v4l friends?) should comment if this doesn't help
solve things on some platforms / subsystems that they care about.

Could I please send a patchset first for the constraint-flags
addition, and then take this up in a following patch-set, once we have
agreement from other stake holders as well?

Russell: would it be ok if we discuss it offline more? I am afraid I
am not as knowledgeable on this topic, and would probably request your
help / guidance here.
