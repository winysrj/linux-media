Sorry, but this isn't right.

You should be able to just set the radio to a frequency and then exit. Since
most cards have an audio out that loops to an audio input you don't want to
have to keep the radio device open.

Audio should be muted when the module is unloaded, though.

The relationship between TV and radio tuners was discussed last year. The
following proposal was accepted:

------- start -----------
How to handle tuner ownership if both a video and radio node share the same
tuner?

Calling S_FREQ, S_TUNER, S_MODULATOR or S_HW_FREQ_SEEK will make the filehandle
the owner if possible. EBUSY is returned if someone else owns the tuner and you
would need to switch the tuner mode.

Ditto for ioctls that expect a valid tuner configuration like QUERYSTD. This is
likely to be driver dependent, though. Just opening a device node should not
switch ownership.

G_FREQUENCY: should just return the last set frequency for radio or TV: requires
that that is remembered when switching ownership. This is what happens today, so
G_FREQUENCY does not have to switch ownership.

G_TUNER: the rxsubchans, signal and afc fields all require ownership of the tuner.
So in principle you would want to switch ownership when G_TUNER is called. On the
other hand, that would mean that calling v4l2-ctl --all -d /dev/radio0 would change
tuner ownership to radio for /dev/video0. That's rather unexpected.

So just set rxsubchans, signal and afc to 0 if the device node doesn't own the tuner.

Closing a device node should not switch ownership. E.g. if nobody has a radio device
open, should the tuner switch back to TV mode automatically? The answer is that it
shouldn't.

How about hybrid tuners? The code to handle tuner ownership should be shared between
DVB and V4L2.
----------- end --------------

All very nice, but nobody had the chance to actually work on this.

But this is how it should work.
