Of course, as soon as I find it. And yes, linux-media periodically drops me from
the list members, so I didn't receive it ...

You must be speaking of "[PATCH v6 4/6] soc_camera: add support for dt binding
soc_camera drivers" ... If you could send it to me by mail I wouldn't have to
fight with Google, spinics and others, and I'll concentrate on the testing side
:)

Cheers.
