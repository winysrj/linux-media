Just drop 'the end of'.

I propose adding 'also' before 'expose' to indicate that it is in
addition to the V4L2 device nodes that were mentioned in the previous
paragraph.

I'd reword this a bit:

For **MC-centric** hardware control it is required to configure the pipelines
via the :ref:`media controller API <media_controller>` before the hardware can be used.

The only thing I am not sure about is vdev-centric vs V4L2-centric. 'Laziness while
typing' is not a convincing argument :-)
