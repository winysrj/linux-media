Only partway through so far :-)

Ticket mutexes as such don't exist, but we have ticket based spinlock
implementations. It seems a situation ripe for confusion to have two
locking primitives (mutex, spinlock) with similar names (ticket) but
vastly different semantics.

Do a google for "lock reservation" and observe the results.. its some
scheme where they pre-assign lock ownership to the most likely thread.

You're providing a generic interface to the core kernel, other people
will end up using it. Providing a proper API is helpful.

Nah, me neither, I just hate reinventing names for something that's
already got a perfectly fine name under which a bunch of people know
it.

See the email from Daniel, apparently its known as wound-wait deadlock
avoidance -- its actually described in the "deadlock" wikipedia
article.

So how about we call the thing something like:

  struct ww_mutex; /* wound/wait */

  int mutex_wound_lock(struct ww_mutex *); /* returns -EDEADLK */
  int mutex_wait_lock(struct ww_mutex *);  /* does not fail */

Hmm.. thinking about that,.. you only need that second variant because
you don't have a clear lock to wait for the 'older' process to
complete; but having the unconditional wait makes the entire thing
prone to accidents and deadlocks when the 'user' (read your fellow
programmers) make a mistake.

Ideally we'd only have the one primitive that returns -EDEADLK and use
a 'proper' mutex to wait on or somesuch.. let me ponder this a bit more.

Yeah, global lock, yay :-(
