Right, so to me that looks like going at the problem backwards. That
will complicate the page-cache instead of your bad hardware drivers
(really, hardware should use IOMMUs already).

So why not work on the page allocator to improve its contiguous
allocation behaviour. If you look at the thing you'll find pageblocks
and migration types. If you change it so that you pin the migration type
of one or a number of contiguous pageblocks to say MIGRATE_MOVABLE, so
that they cannot be used for anything but movable pages you're pretty
much there.
