I just did something stupid and bought this USB device, which according
to AVerMedia has no Linux driver and no planned support.

Other than trying to sell this on eBay, is there a way of getting this
to work? I have searched the archives and google, but cannot find any
reference to this device as its just been released. I don't need support
for the remote, I just want to use MythTV

I'm running 64Bit Ubuntu Karmic with kernel 2.6.31-21-generic

lsusb lists the device as 07ca:0830

Thanks for your help

Leo
