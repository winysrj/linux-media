The PCI spec would call this the "Subsystem".  USB looks like it calls
this the "Product".  I wouldn't think of a USB dongle as a media "board"
per se. "Board" is better than "device" and probably better than
"product", but is "subsystem" better than "board"?

An alternative term could be "A/V Source", avoiding the logical versus
physical "device" mess.  I prefer source/sink terminology when
performing transformations (maybe it's the EE education), and I think
this is the terminology gstreamer uses as well.

Does the encoder definition work on a digital input or analog.  I assume
your intent was digitized input.

Again, an alternative terminology would be "A/V Sink"

Being pedantic:

"ï»¿Decoder: a device that takes a *baseband* analog (e.g. PAL/NTSC) ..."

How about just "physical output/input connection"?  It looks like
gstreamer uses the word "pad".

And since I keep mentioning Gstreamer, here's an article by a TI
software architect, that mentions GStreamer and DaVinci, that may be
apropos:

A media processor can perform "transforms" on a stream.  It may be
helpful to introduce the notion of transforms in the RFC below, since
different media processors will have different capabilities when it
comes to transforms they are able to perform.

Transforms could include: MPEG encoding, MPEG decoding, baseband video
processing (hue, brightness, saturation), baseband audio processing
(volume, balance, bass, treble), VBI functions(?), encryption,
decryption, etc.

Automatic discovery has it's problems.  Applications like MythTV can
benefit from automatic discovery of devices and capability, but there is
currently no way to divine what input carries what signal (OTA broadcast
or cable  RF) not what output goes to what receiver device (TV set or
VCR).  

Automatic discovery would need to guarantee consistent, and perhaps
configurable, ordering of A/V inputs and A/V outputs even in the
presence of errors; or some way to uniquely and consistently identify
A/V inputs and A/V outputs to an application (a UUID or serial number)
so that the proper signals can be routed and processed in the desired
way.

ï»¿Are transforms like encryption (which CX23418 hardware can
theoretically perform according to publicly available product briefs)
lumped into media processor or decoder or would it show up as an
explicit transform downstream of the media processor (or decoder)?

Would you ever need to support the case of a device being able to drive
multiple physical outputs simultaneously?


BTW, it looks like you are converging on the concepts of sources, sinks,
buffers, pipelines, etc. that are used in gstreamer.


Would it desirable to enumerate the transforms the media processor is
capable of; how the transforms, sources, and sinks can be chained
together; and which can be done together or are mutually exclusive?

With there be a way to turn off these side effects if desired (and
supported in hardware)?

How will the relationship between special "related" A/V inputs be
discovered?

You need to define "up stream" and "down stream".  Using a mental model
of input -> transform -> output, with data flowing down stream from
input to output (source to sink), your notion of stream direction seems
backwards to me.

Again I think the notion of presenting the transforms that a media
controller is capable may be worthwhile.  You're so close to the
gstreamer framework concepts, that you could evaluate those concepts to
see if they can inform your proposal.

Overall you seem to have things well thought out.
