Why not? I mean at least for my use case we actually don't need the 
virtual address.

What we need is {dma_addr+dma_len} in a consistent interface which can 
come from both {page,offset,len} as well as {resource, len}.

What I actually don't need is separate handling for system memory and 
resources, but that would we get exactly when we don't use sg_table.
