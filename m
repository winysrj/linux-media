Theodore,

I just try to tell you that they are well known in Germany since decades
and that all contact data are publicly available. 

I did not try to contact them, since in the above case there was no
need. The elta medi@ 8682 LV has the the same PCI subsystem like the
original LifeView product and the TCL tuner was compatible with Philips
and others subsumed under tuner=5.

With the positive exception, that this tuner does not need to be tuned
to some higher frequencies for charge pump, before using radio, like the
compatible Philips types do need it, but on the other hand it had a new
huge SAW filter and sensitivity was a little diminished compared to
original Philips products. Else it had already known Philips chips and
nothing else.

To look at the Copyright in the user manual might give one some hint who
is behind such a product, like for that elta LifeView 3000.
That I'm telling. Animation Technologies in this case.

I also think it should be at least always worth a try to contact them,
in case you can't identify a product they do some marketing for.

Cheers,
Hermann
