Hi,

Could you please clarify the legal status of the following file:
Documentation/DocBook/media_api.tmpl

The license state:
<para>Permission is granted to copy, distribute and/or modify
this document under the terms of the GNU Free Documentation License,
Version 1.1 or any later version published by the Free Software
Foundation. A copy of the license is included in the chapter entitled
"GNU Free Documentation License"</para>

However the gfdl ask you to add explicitly that you have no invariant sections:
"If you have no Invariant Sections, write "with no Invariant Sections"
instead of saying which ones are invariant. If you have no Front-Cover
Texts, write "no Front-Cover Texts" instead of "Front-Cover Texts
being LIST"; likewise for Back-Cover Texts."

Could you please add these sentence to the license text in order to
clarify  the license ?

Thank you

Bastien
