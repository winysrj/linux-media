Could you replace the above with this text (with appropriate indentation 
etc.) while keeping the reference to Wikipedia?

------8<------
Differential pulse-code modulation (DPCM) compression can be used to 
compress the samples into fewer bits than they would otherwise require. 
This is done by calculating the difference between consecutive samples 
and outputting the difference which in average is much smaller than the 
values of the samples themselves since there is generally lots of 
correlation between adjacent pixels. In decompression the original 
samples are reconstructed. The process isn't lossless as the encoded 
sample size in bits is less than the original.

Formats using DPCM compression include <xref 
linkend="pixfmt-srggb10dpcm8" />.

This control is used to select the predictor used to encode the samples.

The main difference between the simple and the advanced predictors is 
image quality, with advanced predictor supposed to produce better 
quality images as a result. Simple predictor can be used e.g. for 
testing purposes.
