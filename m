never cared much about it, but I was the opposite opinion.

If it has Composite or S-Video and audio out it should simply work I
thought when plugged into the inputs of any capture card, also when
switched into video mode.

I tested it once on a cheapo Jenoptik 6.0z3 MPEG4 and don't remember any
problems using an saa7131e Asus P7131 Dual with tvtime on Composite.

In that case it is not registered as storage device at all.

Cheers,
Hermann
