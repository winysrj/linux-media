Thus, you are saying that this will break for people with older user
apps and have a newer kernel?

Ah! Exactly! Thus, those that do not run kernel.org kernels are using a
distro kernel. Wont these same people use the distro userspace? That is,
if they have upgraded their kernel, most likely, they also update their
X interface.

But they can use the i915 driver instead, because they are using the
newer userspace apps.

Well the problem comes down to testing it. I don't know of any developer
that is removing the BKL that actually owns hardware to test out these
broken drivers. And for the change not being trivial, means that there's
no way to do in correctly.
