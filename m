There is also commonly available Cinergy S2 USB HD (USB DVB-S2). I 
tested it recently and it was rather working with s2-liplianin tree. 
Support is not added to the main Kernel for some reason, looks like 
Liplianin is delaying it for some reason. He didn't even answer mail 
when I asked reason for delay :-(
