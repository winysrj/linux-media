I haven't tried it myself, but the other poster on
http://comments.gmane.org/gmane.comp.voip.twinkle/3052 mentions 3.6.2
(and 3.6.3)

I am not seeing any kernel messages at all - the system just freezes
and not even the SysRq stuff works after that.

I upgraded from Ubuntu 12.04 (Linux 3.2) where I didn't see the
problem. However,
http://www.linuxquestions.org/questions/linux-desktop-74/twinkle-causes-linux-freeze-kernel-3-6-2-a-4175433799/
mentions 3.4.0

Unfortunately, I am not really in a position to apply kernel patches
at the moment.

BTW, I have been able to reproduce the problem on a completely
different machine (also running Ubuntu 12.10, but different hardware).
The important thing appears to be that the USB audio device is
connected via a USB 2.0 hub (and then using the test code posted in
http://pastebin.com/aHGe1S1X specifying the audio device as
"plughw:Set" (or whatever it's called) seems to trigger the freeze).

So I guess another question is: do you have a USB headset connected
via a USB 2.0 hub and not seeing the problem or is your USB headset
not connected via a USB 2.0 hub? (of course, it would also be useful
if others could comment if they are seeing the problem with that setup
or not)
