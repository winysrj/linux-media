I asked this on the v4l list and didn't get any replies.  I am not sure 
which list is more appropriate for this device, so I figured I should 
ask here also.

Thanks,

I just heard back from Hauppauge that they are expecting[1] the Linux 
community to produce their own driver for this device.  I was wondering 
if any of the v4l developers have received a prerelease unit or 
documentation to aid in the driver development.  For those that may not 
be familiar with the device it is a high-definition component video 
capture device.  It outputs an H.264/AVC stream (not sure what the 
actual container format is) over USB 2.0 high speed.  Here is a link to 
their product page: http://www.hauppauge.com/site/products/hd_pvr.html .

[1] Exact text of reply: "Linux drivers will not be available for this 
product at the time of it's release. All Linux support for Hauppauge 
hardware is 3rd party, so in time, there likely will be a Linux driver 
available from the Linux community like most of the other Hauppauge 
products, but nothing in the short term."
