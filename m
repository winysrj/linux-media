Subject: [PATCH v4 0/7] Driver for Si476x series of chips
Date: Mon, 18 Feb 2013 19:59:28 -0800

This is a fourth version of the patchset originaly posted here:
https://lkml.org/lkml/2012/9/13/590

Second version of the patch was posted here:
https://lkml.org/lkml/2012/10/5/598

Third version of the patch was posted here:
https://lkml.org/lkml/2012/10/23/510

To save everyone's time I'll repost the original description of it:

This patchset contains a driver for a Silicon Laboratories 476x series
of radio tuners. The driver itself is implemented as an MFD devices
comprised of three parts: 
 1. Core device that provides all the other devices with basic
functionality and locking scheme.
 2. Radio device that translates between V4L2 subsystem requests into
Core device commands.
 3. Codec device that does similar to the earlier described task, but
for ALSA SoC subsystem.

v4 of this driver has following changes:
 - All of the adjustable timeouts(expose via sysfs) are gone
 - Names of the controls are changes as was requested
 - Added documentation for exposed debugfs files 
 - Minor fix in si476x_radio_fops_poll
 - DBG_BUFFER is removed
 - Tested for compilation w/o debugfs enabled

This version still has all the radio controls being private. The
reason for that is because I am not sure how that should be handled.

Hans, do you want me to move all the controls to be standard, that is
exted V4L's with the needed controls? Should I pick up the parts of
http://lists-archives.com/linux-kernel/27641304-radio-fixes-and-new-features-for-fm.html and take relevants bits and pieces of it?

How do you want that to be handled?
