when the exporter creates the dma_buf handle(for example, gem -> fd),
I think the refcount of gem object should be increased at this point,
and decreased by dma_buf->ops->release() again because when the
dma_buf is created and dma_buf_export() is called, this dma_buf refers
to the gem object one time. and in case of inporter(fd -> gem),
file->f_count of the dma_buf is increased and then when this gem
object is released by user request such as drm close or
drn_gem_close_ioctl, dma_buf_put() should be called by
dma_buf->ops->detach() to decrease file->f_count again because the gem
object refers to the dma_buf. for this, you can refer to my test
repository I mentioned above. but the problem is that when a buffer is
released by one side, another can't know whether the buffer already
was released or not.
note : in case of sharing a buffer between v4l2 and drm driver, the
memory info would be copied vb2_xx_buf to xx_gem or xx_gem to
vb2_xx_buf through sg table. in this case, only memory info is used to
share, not some objects.

Ok, got it. thanks. :)
