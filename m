The whole project went badly wrong when the hardware vendor promised
documentation then failed to deliver. My mistake for trusting them in
the first place.

I had considered running a driver reverse engineering tutorial project
via kernellabs.com. Perhaps a 4 part series of writings, tools and
instructions that describe how to reverse engineer USB drivers and
culminates in a working skeleton driver for the WinTV CI that could be
used. I doubt I could make this happen without a project sponsor so if
you know any companies that would be willing to sponsor a project like
this then I'd certainly be interested in helping.
