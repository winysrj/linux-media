Hello everybody,

Following steps of http://istvanv.users.sourceforge.net/v4l/xc4000.html I have been able to receive analog input (composite) and watch it with VLC.

Now, I am interested in streaming the MPEG-2 stream generated by the cx23417 encoder chip included with the card. Is this possible with this card Leadtek Winfast PxDVR3200 H XC4000? How could I setup the card for outputing MPEG-2 stream?

Thank you very much in advance.
Gonzalo Berdeal.
