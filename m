This will be a bit ugly, but we can also use that code and compile it conditionally
when CMA has been enabled. Pages, which have incorrect migrate type on free finally
causes pageblock migration type change from MIGRATE_CMA to MIGRATE_MOVABLE. This is
not a problem for non-CMA case where only pageblocks with MIGRATE_MOVABLE migration
type are being isolated.
