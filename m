While discussing the topics for the media workshop that will happen together
with this year's KS/2011, one issue related to the USB stack came on our
discussions: it is related to multi-function USB devices, as you can
see on this thread:
	http://www.spinics.net/lists/linux-media/msg36195.html

We have several cases of multi-function devices at the media subsystem.
For example, most TV grabber devices provides Remote Controller, Video,
audio and MPEG streaming capabilities, either implementing the standard
USB API's, or the vendor class API's. There are even some devices that
support USB storage, 3G modem and Digital TV.

Some of those devices have some resources that are mutually exclusive.

For example, some Digital Cameras can provide either access to the stored
images, or can be used as webcams. Using them as webcams automatically
deletes all stored images from it. So, a properly implemented driver
should be returning -EBUSY (or -EPERM?) if someone tries to stream for
such devices if is there any pictures stored on it. Symmetrically,
accessing the stored pictures there should return -EBUSY if the device
is streaming.

Currently, the data access for Digital Cameras is implemented via libusb,
libgphoto and gvfs, while the streaming interface is implemented via
a gspca Kernel driver.

I know that this problem were somewhat solved for 3G modems, with the usage
of the userspace problem usb_modeswitch, and with some quirks for the USB
storage driver, but I'm not sure if such tricks will scale forever, as more
functions are seen on some USB devices.

So, if we have some time, maybe we could start some discussions about that
during the USB mini-summit.

It should be noticed that the media subsystem has currently similar problems 
on devices that provide both analog and digital TV, as some resources, like 
the tuner can't be used simultaneously by the two API's. This happens even
with PCI devices. So, maybe, in the end, we'll be writing some kernel library
for resource locking, but it would be good if we can have preliminary
discussions there, and let the final discussions to happen during KS/2011. 

What do you think?

Thanks!
Mauro
