I'm sorry if I was unclear, but I'm not doing that. Contrary, I'm sure
that people using dreamtuner (which uses vtunerc from userspace) over
the Internet will run into problems if they can't provide the necessary
bandwidth.

What I'm trying to point out is that dreamtuner is not trying to solve
these problems, because it specifically has been designed for a
different purpose.

Yes, if you knew. But you wouldn't, because when travelling, it's
unlikely that you could guarantee the necessary bandwidth all the time.
I'd highly recommend you and Mark to use a different solution than
dreamtuner for your use cases.

I wonder how.

It may or may not work for some people. There's no need to artificially
restrict dreamtuner to hosts on a LAN (which would be impossible anyway).

FWIW, It's HoP's code. I'm not developing it.

Although you seem to have noticed that all networking happens in
userspace, you're still discussing networking issues, which may or may
not be issues of dreamtuner, but provably not of vtunerc, which just
relays DVB driver calls to userspace.

Since the topic is about the inclusion of vtunerc, not dreamtuner, such
stuff really is totally off-topic, but unfortunately got brought up
again and again.

You don't drive a formula one car or a truck if you want to have a
picnic with your family, do you? I guess you'd rather choose the right
tool for this task. So should you do if you want to stream television
over the net. People complaining that they can't transport their family
in a formula one car don't help anybody. Still both formula one cars and
trucks may be useful for other purposes.

You're free to replace dreamtuner with your superior tool solving all of
Mark's issues, even without the need to change vtunerc.

So far many people jumped into this discussion, but virtually(!) nobody
took the time to understand what vtunerc actually does by looking at the
code or at the various links HoP provided.

Andreas
