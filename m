Hi Devin,

Yup, here's a quote from his initial pull request. I guess it doesn't
make completely clear why he did what he did unless you knew in advance
that the demod did DVB-T and DVB-C.

Back to your comments:

Agreed, but I had thought that with a single adapter with two frontends
it would be possible to obey the rules and only use one at once. If
frontend0 is in use, then if you try to open either frontend0 or
frontend1, you should get device busy... so I don't see it causing
massive issues.

Like you say, though, S2API is probably the better approach, with the
frontend advertising its supported modulations and selecting one as
required.

Seeing as the 290e is the only cxd2820r based device supported in Linux
right now, combined with the fact that it isn't even advertised as a
DVB-C device by PCTV Systems, that's probably an acceptable hit to take.

I'd be interested to see what Antti thinks though. :)
