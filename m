I'm Manu sorry about trying to put patches directly into v4-dvb, if 
those should go onto your branch first.

So, what Manu do you think about my DMA patch or other patches I sent 
into linux-media mailing list this weekend?
Is it okay to generate one interrupt once per 16k bytes,
or are the interrupts too rare?

At least VDR reads the DVB stream rarely, so I think
that it is enough if the DVB card has always something
to be delivered when VDR or MythTV asks more data,
so if the number of DMA transfer IRQs is twice than the
number of times VDR or MythTV asks more data per second,
then the context switches are in balance.

Understandable DMA RISC programming should be easier to maintain, and it 
removes the initial garbage from the stream too.

How about the tasklet enable/disable patch I wrote?

What needs to be done for these patches to be accepted?

Best regards,
Marko
