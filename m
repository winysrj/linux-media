Let's clear something up about the DMA API, which I think is causing some
misunderstanding here.  For this purpose, I'm going to talk about
dma_map_single(), but the same applies to the scatterlist and _page
variants as well.

	dma = dma_map_single(dev, cpuaddr, size, dir);

dev := the device _performing_ the DMA operation.  You are quite correct
       that in the case of a USB peripheral device, the device is normally
       the USB HCI device.

dma := dma address to be programmed into 'dev' which corresponds (by some
       means) with 'cpuaddr'.  This may not be the physical address due
       to bus offset translations or mappings setup in IOMMUs.

Therefore, it is wrong to talk about a 'physical address' when talking
about the DMA API.

We can take this one step further.  Lets say that the USB HCI is not
capable of performing memory accesses itself, but it is connected to a
separate DMA engine device:

	mem <---> dma engine <---> usb hci <---> usb peripheral

(such setups do exist, but despite having such implementations I've never
tried to support it.)

In this case, the dma engine, in response to control signals from the
USB host controller, will generate the appropriate bus address to access
memory and transfer the data into the USB HCI device.

So, in this case, the struct device to be used for mapping memory for
transfers to the usb peripheral is the DMA engine device, not the USB HCI
device nor the USB peripheral device.
