So you could finally use VDR as a server/client setup using vtuner,
right? With full OSD, timer, etc? Yes, I'm aware that streamdev
exists. It was horrible when I tried it last (a long time ago) and I
understand it's gotten better. But it's not a suitable replacement for
a real server/client setup. It sounds like using vtuner, this would
finally be possible and since Klaus has no intention of ever
modernizing VDR into server/client (that I'm aware of), it's also the
only suitable option as well.

Or am I wrong about anything?  If not, I know several users who would
like to use this, myself included.
