Hi,

I'm trying to find a way to be able to uniquely identify each device in 
a PC and was hoping to use either serial or MAC for this purpose.

I've looked at the documentation but can't find a generic way to read 
back serial numbers or MAC addresses from V4L devices? Does such a 
function exist?

Thanks,

Lou
