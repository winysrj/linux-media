Thanks for the report. Do you use Android's lowmemorykiller? I haven't 
tested CMA on Android kernel yet. I have no idea how it will interfere 
with Android patches.

Yeah. We also did such stress tests recently and faced this issue. I've
spent some time investigating it but I have no solution yet. 

The problem is caused by a page, which is put in the CMA area. This page 
is movable, but it's address space provides no 'migratepage' method. In
such case mm subsystem uses fallback_migrate_page() function. Sadly this
function only returns -EAGAIN. The migration loops a few times over it
and fails causing the fail in the allocation procedure.

We are investing now which kernel code created/allocated such problematic
pages and how to add real migration support for them.
