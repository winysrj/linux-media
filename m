Hey,

this one still seems to be broken, with all recent kernels. I wasn't
able to see which patches turned the card into a non-working state. I
know that pretty old kernels (i can't use them otherwise i would have
downgraded) work fine with that card.

For those who are interested in the original issue:
http://www.mail-archive.com/linux-media@vger.kernel.org/msg29147.html

Around 2008-2009 the card made it into linux and was working a few
weeks after these mails:
http://www.linuxtv.org/pipermail/linux-dvb/2008-April/025224.html

I'm curious, anyone else using this card (expresscard) successful? if
yes, with which kernel? Any chance that this is going to be fixed or
should i better buy a new expresscard? Is there some suggestion for a
dvb-t expresscard which will still work in 2-3 years in linux?

Thanks in advance,
Jean
