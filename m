I just ran depmod to make sure things were straight in this dept.

kepler ~ # depmod -F System.map -e -av 2.6.39.3

There are no reported errors.   The modules rc-imon-mce.ko,
rc-imon-pad.ko and imon.ko depend only on rc-core.ko according to the
output.  There don't seem to be any explicit dependencies to the keymaps
(not a kernel dev so I don't know if there should be)

I can only see the "T.889" string in the System.map, kernel binary and
kernel/sched.o (but not the source?).  I have sent the config file
off-list to Jarod.

I will try a Gentoo out-of-the-box kernel config when I finish work also.

Thanks once again for your time
