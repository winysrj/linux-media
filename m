Users *especially* have a vote. This poll is among others meant to get a
feeling for how important people think the backwards compat is. I think it
is of limited importance, but I've no way of knowing that for certain
unless I get feedback. So I invite anyone, developer or user, to give
their opinion!

And it's not a case of 'most votes count'. It's not that type of a poll.
It's really a survey. (Hmm, that would have been a better name for this
anyway. So sue me :-) ).

Regards,

         Hans
