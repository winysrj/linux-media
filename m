Ok, nice, though what is your plan to display the result now ? This is
important information to get any help.

Ok, let us know when the switch is made. Assuming your goal is to get
the HW decoder working, you should test with simpler pipeline. In your
specific case, you should try and get this pipeline to preroll:

gst-launch-1.0 \
  filesrc location=/home/H264_test1_Talk inghead_mp4_480x360.mp4 \
  ! qtdemux ! h264parse ! v4l2video1dec ! fakesink

If that pipeline does not reach PLAYING state, it means the decoder
never produced any output. You should also learn to use the tracing
system in GStreamer and make sure you have the source code next to you.
I would also suggest to try your best to sort as much as you can, make
sure you understand what you are trying to achieve and then come back
with questions.
