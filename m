Why don't you just send individual patches for each subsystem? I'm not a maintainer but I don't see
how any one person is going to be able to apply this whole series, it is making it hard for
maintainers if they have to pick patches out from among the series (if indeed any will bother
doing that).

I get that this will be more work for you but AFAIK we are optimizing for maintainers.

Good luck,
Tobin.
