Good!

I started a documentation of videobuf KABI at:
	~/tokernel/wrk/linus/Documentation/video4linux/v4l2-framework.txt 

For now, it covers only the common code (offering a view for driver writers,
not for videobuf writers), but I think we can extend it (or create a separate
doc) with internal details. In the future, we should consider converting it to
docbook and produce a complete V4L2 KABI doc.

Feel free to add some notes there.

:)

The rationale for that comment is that we shouldn't reformat the received data
inside kernel (like doing format conversions), but, instead, let this task to
happen at userspace if needed. 

With PCI, this is very clear: it just fills the frame data via DMA, and adds the
corresponding meta-data to the videobuf structures at interrupt time. This is
possible, since DMA generates IRQ only after receiving a complete frame, so
meta-data can be added without troubles.

Although videobuf-vmalloc itself doesn't touch at the data (behaving just like
PCI videobuf's), this note is not quite true with the clients of
videobuf-vmalloc (vivi and the USB drivers), since:

1) all USB drivers I know use a small transport layer over USB to indicate
frame begin/end and eventually to multiplex with VBI and/or audio. So,
the usb drivers need to get rid of the USB transport layer, providing only the
stream data to userspace, and filling the meta-data based on the transport layer;

2) vivi produces the stream data.

Thanks!

Anytime.
