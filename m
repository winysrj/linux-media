I liked the idea of your redesign, but I didn't like the removal of
a per-decoder sysfs entry. As already discussed, there are cases where
we'll need a per-decoder sysfs entry (lirc_dev is probably one of those
cases - also Jarod's imon driver is currently implementing a modprobe
parameter that needs to be moved to the driver).

So, while we can implement some core support at the raw event core, we should
keep the decoder attributes internally inside the driver. So, each decoder
may have his own code like:

static struct attribute *decoder_attributes[] = {
       &dev_attr_enabled.attr,
       &dev_attr_bar1.attr,
       &dev_attr_bar2.attr,
       &dev_attr_bar3.attr,
       NULL
};

static struct attribute_group decoder_attribute_group = {
       .name   = "foo_decoder",
       .attrs  = decoder_attributes,
};

As the attr_enabled is common to all, maybe we can have a default enable
code at the .h or inside the core.
 
Cheers,
Mauro
