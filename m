Still, vtunerc waits for write operations:

http://code.google.com/p/vtuner/source/browse/vtunerc_proxyfe.c?repo=linux-driver#285

No matter if they are read or write, all of them call this function:

http://code.google.com/p/vtuner/source/browse/vtunerc_ctrldev.c?repo=linux-driver#390

That has a wait_event inside that function, as everything is directed to
the userspace.

This is probably the way Florian found to return the errors returned by
the ioctls. This driver is synchronous, with simplifies it, at the lack of
performance.

Ok, the driver could be smarter than that, and some heuristics could be
added into it, in order to foresee the likely error code, returning it
in advance, and then implementing some asynchronous mechanism that would
handle the error later, but that would be complex and may still introduce
some bad behaviors.

Mauro.
