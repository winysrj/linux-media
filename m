In the worst of the cases, I'll have to return the cards to my vendor as 
TechniSat might just no longer make 2.6 cards anymore. Then what would 
be the recommanded alternative hardware that could work for me? A few 
years back, I've was using a budget Hauppauge Nova-S card. But it might 
be outdated and/or hard to find in large quantities these days.

Any recommendation for cards that would be well supported by the kernel 
and are still "comfortably" available? We're doing DVB-IP stuff (no TV 
watching).
