No, not at all, given my bad English too.

We usually have enough people to come around any language barriers.

There have always been high level developers from Russia and Ukraine is
very lively too.

I just tell, we have no other report for that driver globally, which
would tell it broken on something currently.

So it is either card specific, maybe not correctly enough identified,
chip specific we can exclude with knowing it is a saa7131e now, or some
less usual TV picture and sound system is in use.

Easiest way to exclude that, is some other people from the Ukraine
report that they are fine with tda8275a tuners and saa7131e or other
such chips ... or not!

I just try to narrow down the ground eventually worth digging ...

Cheers,
Hermann
