I think this highly depends on the board and on the use case. We know
that 2 MB is usually enough, because that is the current CONSISTENT_DMA_SIZE
on most platforms. Most likely something a lot smaller will be ok
in practice. CONSISTENT_DMA_SIZE is currently used for both atomic
and non-atomic allocations.

For a first version that sounds good enough. Maybe we could use a fraction
of the CONSISTENT_DMA_SIZE as an estimate?

For the long-term solution, I see two options:

1. make the preallocated pool rather small so we normally don't need it.
2. make it large enough so we can also fulfill most nonatomic allocations
   from that pool to avoid the TLB flushes and going through the CMA
   code. Only use the real CMA region when the pool allocation fails.

In either case, there should be some method for balancing the pool
size.

My guess is that you can assume to have 64 MB or more on ARMv6 running Linux,
but other people may have more accurate data.

Also, there is the option of setting a lower value for FORCE_MAX_ZONEORDER
for some platforms if it becomes a problem.
