Hi Laurent,

Yes, I know :-)

The first version of the patch-set was only mean so you can review it
but then I understood that your idea is to actually merge some code I
send a few ours ago a v2 of the patch-set [1].

This v2 is a simpler code that doesn't move any of the logic to the
VD1 interrupt handler so it won't brake others components (resizer,
previewer, etc). So first we can focus to have a working version of
the interlaced video data support in the driver and then try to fix
the artifact effect issue.

It is based on an early version of our patch and also I've address all
the issues you called out on the second patch. The fact that the code
to address interlaced video is not bt656 but fldmode dependent.

Also I split the patches in atomic operations so it can be applied
incrementally without breaking the driver.

Please let me know if you got the v2 patches or I can resend them if
it is easier for you.
