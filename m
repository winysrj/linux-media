Foremost, we introduce this commission, The INTERPOL. We fight global crime including internet fraud and money laundering. Our commission has rounded-up well over 27,000 fraudsters and we are still battling these nefarious individuals. We are aware that quite a lot of people have been conned into parting with huge amounts.

The United Nation has vowed to combat these crimes. As such due to their efforts and contributions, we have been able to recovered over USD$1.3 Million Dollars (One Million Three Hundred Thousand United States Dollars) till date.
Amongst the details yours was found to include your email. Our aim is to return all lost assets including funds to legitimate individuals identified.

After a mandated investigation of the apprehended persons, the United Nations has approved the total sum of USD$1,000,000 (One Million United States Dollars only), as compensation to the funds you lost. This amount will be paid to you in the oncoming days with your co-operation as we commence to conclude the investigation on your case.

There will be a series of questions we will ask to aid us in rounding-up your case file. Please respond with your full names and address, country of origin, company's name and position (if any), current occupation, daytime mobile (phone) number for easy communication for ratification and to redeem your fund.

We await your swift response to this notification.
