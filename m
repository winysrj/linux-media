Hello Hans,

I will be attending the audio seminars, since I have a keen interest
in finally getting the audio and video streams properly associated for
raw analog video (so that applications such as tvtime will work
out-of-the-box).

I would be happy to meet up with you afterward and share my notes.

Cheers,

Devin
