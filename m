Yes, posix is not 100% clear about what "non block" means for ioctl's, but
waiting for an event is clearly a block condition. This is different than
doing something like mdelay() (or even mleep()) in order to wait for an
specific amount of time for an operation to complete.

A vtunerc => daemon => network transfer =>daemon => vtunerc is a block condition,
as the network may return in a few ms or may not return and a long
timeout at the daemon would give an error. Also, as the daemon may be swapped
to disk (as the daemon runs on userspace), this may even involve other
blocking operations at the block layer.

It is not a bug in the application. It requested a non-block mode. The driver
is working in block mode instead. It is a driver's bug.

TCP flow control mechanisms, RSVP, MPLS, IP QoS flags, ICMP messages, etc.

Network applications (Youtube, Skype, mplayer, you name it) have
mechanisms to handle high delays, congestion, etc. Cheating with a non-network
application to work via the network is not the same as a network-based application.
You'll never achieve the same result. Only if the network is close to a
"pure wire" (e. g., no congestion, no packet loss, etc), such solution
works.

The right thing to do is to return -EAGAIN for all syscalls while the firmware
is not loaded. Unfortunately, several driversdon't do the right thing.
