Pinnacle PCTV Dual DVB-T Pro PCI 2000i (http://linuxtv.org/wiki/index.php/DVB-
T_PCI_Cards#Pinnacle) was introduced in 2006 and after 5 years it is still 
unsupported in linux!
Unbelievable!
Yet its chips Zarlink ZL10353 (http://linuxtv.org/wiki/index.
php/Zarlink_ZL10353) and Microtune MT2060 (http://linuxtv.org/wiki/index.
php/Microtune_MT2060) are supported (http://www.linuxtv.
org/downloads/drivers/linux-media-LATEST.tar.bz2)!
So, what is missing?
Probably this is the reason why Linux is not so widespread: LACK OF DRIVERS!
And this is the reason why a lot of users cannot migrate to Linux and are 
forced to use that stupid O.S. called Win****!
If anyone wants to have a look at Windows' drivers and is able to develop 
drivers (I'm not), here are the drivers:

Sorry for the outburst.
A user wishing to migrate to Linux.
