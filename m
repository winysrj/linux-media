I anded by changing it to:

Changes done. I'll place on a new version of this series.

Despite the laziness of playing a lot with shifts to type V4L2-centric,
the thing that bothers me with V4L2 is that the subdev API is part of
V4L2 spec. So, IMHO, it is still a confusing name.

As this actually refers to "V4L2 Device Node", with is now properly
specified (due to patch 1/3), "vdev" is a good shortcut for it.

Let's reverse the question: what's wrong with "vdev-centric"?

Thanks,
