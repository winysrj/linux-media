Videobuf2 requires memory module handlers to provide vaddr method to provide a pointer in 
kernel virtual address space to video data (buffer content). It is used for example by 
read()/write() io method emulator. Memory allocator/handler should not be specific to any
particular use case in the device driver. That's the design. Simple.

I your case you want to give pointer to struct page from the memory allocator to the 
driver. The cookie method has been introduced exactly for this purpose. Memory allocator
also provides a simple inline function to convert generic 'void *' return type from cookie
method to allocator specific structure/pointer. vb2_dma_contig_plane_dma_addr() and 
vb2_dma_sg_plane_desc() were examples how does passing allocator specific type though the
cookie method works.
