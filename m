Although I am an experienced Solaris middle-ware programmer and have some limited driver experience on VxWorks, I am new to the world of Linux drivers.  I'll likely need a bit of hand-holding on this one.

First, here is the command stream I got from the Ubuntu forums in trying to get my new web cam working.  At this point it is well known that web cam support in 8.10 is broken, hence the need to compile an install a new copy of gspca.


sudo apt-get install subversion build-essential linux-headers-$(uname -r) &&
wget http://linuxtv.org/hg/~jfrancois/gspca/archive/tip.tar.bz2 &&
tar xf tip.tar.bz2 &&
cd gspca-* &&
make &&
sudo make install &&
sudo depmod -ae $(uname -r)

Here is the output from dmesg:
[22620.920030] usb 3-2: new full speed USB device using uhci_hcd and address 2
[22621.111879] usb 3-2: configuration #1 chosen from 1 choice
[22621.620524] Linux video capture interface: v2.00
[22621.645354] usbcore: registered new interface driver snd-usb-audio
[22621.667744] sn9c102: V4L2 driver for SN9C1xx PC Camera Controllers v1:1.47pre49
[22621.670466] usb 3-2: SN9C105 PC Camera Controller detected (vid:pid 0x0471:0x0327)
[22621.851468] usb 3-2: No supported image sensor detected for this bridge
[22621.852729] usbcore: registered new interface driver sn9c102

So, you are correct that it is trying to use the sn9c102 driver.  Could you provide me with a little more information on how to remove this driver from the gspca config before rebuilding it?  Do I comment it out in the v4l/.config file or change the "=m" to something else?

I've downloaded svv.c, but I'm having trouble linking it.  It appears to need library /usr/lib/libv4l/v4l2convert.so, but the -l directive prepends "lib" onto the lib name, so the linker doesn't find it.  What is the appropriate gcc syntax to link svv.c with this lib?  Or is there a bug in the make install such that the lib was not named correctly?

Thanks for your help,

Curt

Hello Curt,

I don't know which driver you used. If it is the sn9c102, please,
regenerate, removing this driver from the config.

Also, as this webcam has not be tested yet, I'd be glad to know if it
works. If it does not, may you send me the last kernel messages after
pluging the webcam (do a grep on 'gspca' and 'sonixj'), and the
image.dat generated by my program svv (if any - do 'svv -rg').

Regards.
