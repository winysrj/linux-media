In an ideal world, yes. But that would only work if we know the exact
units in which the controls operate, and we don't. Also notice that even
if we had some sort of feedback looped software awb algorithm to get
over the units issue, the pac7302 is really funky in that it has both
blue / red balance controls and a color temperature control, so which
of those should such a software awb control ?

Right, the advantage of doing software whitebalance using software rgb
gains, is that we know the units of the software gains, so we don't need
a feedback loop, instead we just measure which correction we think we
should apply, and then apply it "blindly" (so without any feedback loop).

Hans
