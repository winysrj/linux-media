hi all hvr4000 "friends"

i am wondering if someone has this card working a little more then I do.

i have dvb-s working quite good. the only thing what I can say
positively about thisc card is that it at least reports a better signal
strength and also SNR. so it is possible that the part "before" the
chipset from the viewpoint of the signal arriving from space it may
have a better "tuner".

but so far ... has someone dvb-s2 working? (on linux/not freebsd!!)
