Yes, exactly. Well my example was the unlikely case when the object is 
swapped out and immediately swapped in again because somebody needs it.

Sounds good and I find it great that you're volunteering for that :D

Ok seriously, my drawing capabilities are a bit underdeveloped. So I 
would prefer if somebody could at least help with that.

What do you mean with that?

Actually it isn't so hard, it's just that I didn't had time so far to 
clean it up and we never hit that issue so far during our reset testing.

The main point missing just a bit of functionality in the reservation 
object and Chris and I already had a good idea how to implement that.

Correct, but I don't understand why that is so hard on i915? Our GPU 
scheduler makes all of that rather trivial, e.g. fences either signal 
correctly or are aborted and set as erroneous after a timeout.

Again at least from amdgpu side I don't see much of an issue with that. 
So what exactly do you have in mind here?

Good point, never wrapped my head fully around that one either.

Yes, except for fallback paths and bootup self tests we simply never 
wait for fences while holding locks.

Yeah, we had lots of fun with the mm locks as well but as far as I know 
Felix and I already fixed all of them.
