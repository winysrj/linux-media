Hi

I'm an app developer and no experience with linuxtv.  I want to build an app capable of synch with live tv.

What i figured so far is that i could have a linux computer with a capture card,  analyze  the MPEG-2 stream, somehow obtain the PCR(?) and i would be able to broadcast the timestamp and maybe other data that to my app.

Questions/comments:
Is this a good approach
This has done before and you only need to download _____XYz software______ (free or $$)
Not done before, but you here a few resources that should get you started.
I use ubuntu and card recommendations are welcomed.

Thanks in advance
