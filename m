Good Day From Syria,

My name is Abdul Nasser Sokariah and I am writing you from Syria, I
choose to contact you directly as I need a reliable person to trust
who can help me make claims to my huge deposit with a vault company in
AFRICA, and based on my present situation in Syria, I need you
urgently to take  possession of everything and further
modalities/directives will follow.

Contact me  only on my private Email:nabdul247@gmail.com for
clarifications,I await your response.

Yours truly, Abdul Nasser Sokariah
