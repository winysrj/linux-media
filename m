Hi Oliver.

Yep, so far, so good. :)

I can do that too, no problem. I end up here:
<http://linuxtv.org/wiki/index.php/Template:USB_Device_Data#zolid-mini-dvb-t-stick-v1>

Not on my end. The page I have now says...
---8<-----8<-----8<-----
"zolid-mini-dvb-t-stick-v1
The data for the device zolid-mini-dvb-t-stick-v1 is right here. You just can't see it because it is meant to be used in a template 'transclusion'. If you are logged in you can click on the [edit] link to the right to change the data for this device. If you are not logged in, you can click on the view source tab at the top of this page to at least see how data is stored here.
It's probably best if you open the edit link in a separate tab. That way you can use this tab to read the explanation of the syntax above or jump back to the place where you came from and see how your changes look there. (Don't forget that your browser cache or the wiki's rendering cache might need some time or persuasion to catch up with the new content.)"
----->8----->8----->8---
...And there are no clickable links there.

I have all ad-blockers turned off, and no custom/user CSS in my browser; also tried in Opera, no dice...

If, on the other hand, I scroll to the top of this page, and click the "View Source" tab, I get the following in the top of the new page:
---8<-----8<-----8<-----
  "You do not have permission to edit this page, for the following reasons: 
  The action you have requested is limited to users in the group: Users.
  You do not have permission to edit pages in the Template namespace.

  You can view and copy the source of this page:"

I guess this is supposed to happen, but it does not happen for me. Perhaps I need some access granted from somewhere or someone ?

I'll remember this for when I get the first part to work. :)
