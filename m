The fence guards a single operation, as such I didn't feel like more than one
dma-buf was needed to guard it.

Have you considered simply attaching multiple fences instead? Each with their own dma-buf.
There has been some muttering about allowing multiple exclusive fences to be attached, for arm soc's.

But I'm also considering getting rid of the dma-buf member and add a function call to retrieve it, since
the sync dma-buf member should not be changing often, and it would zap 2 atomic ops on every fence,
but I want it replaced by something that's not 10x more complicated.

Maybe "int get_sync_dma_buf(fence, old_dma_buf, &new_dma_buf)" that will set new_dma_buf = NULL
if the old_dma_buf is unchanged, and return true + return a new reference to the sync dma_buf if it's not identical to old_dma_buf.
old_dma_buf can also be NULL or a dma_buf that belongs to a different fence->context entirely. It might be capable of
returning an error, in which case the fence would count as being signaled. This could reduce the need for separately checking
fence_is_signaled first.

I think this would allow caching the synchronization dma_buf in a similar way without each fence needing
to hold a reference to the dma_buf all the time, even for fences that are only used internally.

Why do you need this? the base fence already has a context member.

In fact I don't see why you need a linked list, at worst you'd need a static array since the amount of
dma-bufs should already be known during allocation time.

I would prefer to simply make reservation_object->fence_exclusive an array, since it would be easier to implement,
and there have been some calls that arm might need such a thing.

Way too complicated..
