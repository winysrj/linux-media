I didn't thoroughly review the patches, but I did try them out (to be
precise, I tried v15) on an OMAP4 PandaBoard, and really liked the
result.

The interfaces seem clean and convenient and things seem to work (I
used a private CMA pool with rpmsg and remoteproc, but also noticed
that several other drivers were utilizing the global pool). And with
this in hand we can finally ditch the old reserve+ioremap approach.

So from a user perspective, I sure do hope this patch set gets into
3.2; hopefully we can just fix anything that would show up during the
3.2 cycle.

Marek, Michal (and everyone involved!), thanks so much for pushing
this! Judging from the history of this patch set and the areas that it
touches (and from the number of LWN articles ;) it looks like a
considerable feat.

FWIW, feel free to add my

(small and optional comment: I think it'd be nice if
dma_declare_contiguous would fail if called too late, otherwise users
of that misconfigured device will end up using the global pool without
easily knowing that something went wrong)

Thanks,
Ohad.
