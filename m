I'm even more impatient than you.

Why is it so difficult to merge a little and isolated piece of code which
has been reported as both working and useful?

I don't know how many trees this code has to be propagated through,
but I'm afraid it will be a long time before I see support for this
hardware in a stock Fedora kernel. Maybe the hardware could be
considered obsolete by then.

Isn't one of the expected advantages of the free software +
public mailing lists + user testing + git repositories
model to have a fast pace of development?

Waiting and hoping.
