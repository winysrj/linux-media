Hi Prabhakar and others,

(Just resending; Laurent's e-mail address corrected, cc Hans, too.)

As discussed, here's the todo list for inclusion to staging.

- User space interface refinement
	- Controls should be used when possible rather than private ioctl
	- No enums should be used
	- Use of MC and V4L2 subdev APIs when applicable
	- Single interface header might suffice
	- Current interface forces to configure everything at once
- Get rid of the dm365_ipipe_hw.[ch] layer
- Active external sub-devices defined by link configuration; no strcmp
  needed
- More generic platform data (i2c adapters)
- The driver should have no knowledge of possible external subdevs; see
  struct vpfe_subdev_id
- Some of the hardware control should be refactorede
- Check proper serialisation (through mutexes and spinlocks)
- Names that are visible in kernel global namespace should have a common
  prefix (or a few)

This list likely isn't complete, but some items such as the locking one is
there simply because I'm not certain of the state of it.
