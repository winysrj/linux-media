(11:18:42) hverkuil: mchehab: ping
(11:21:01) hverkuil: mchehab: please add the 'make sure drivers supply a zeroed struct v4l2_subdev' patch to the 2.6.39 pull request!
(11:21:53) hverkuil: It fixes a 2.6.38 regression and it really needs to be upstreamed asap.


I intend to add it on the next series. As you know, patches need to go first to -next
tree before being merged. Unfortunately, patchwork is broken for about one week. A mysql
replication error damaged the database, and about 270 patches got lost. kernel.org
maintainer is working on a way to re-add the missing patches.

Mauro.
