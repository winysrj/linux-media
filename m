Hmm. I guess there's no really a way to avoid it. But we could make it
easier

But -1 is perfectly valid. If you wanted to make it look really interesting,
you could return -!false and still have exactly the same functionality. ;-)

Endpoints are indeed another option.

Is there something that would prevent switching from device node matching to
port / endpoint matching altogether? I don't think the driver changes should
be difficult to make.

Supporting different options there will be painful as it will likely require
help from the driver to implement both --- separately.
