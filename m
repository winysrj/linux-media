Yes, Edgar, exactly: This is what the name Manu A. stands for since this guy 
was recruited as a DVB "maintainer" by Johannes Stezenbach:

Kiddish political games which are played on the shoulders of the users.
Also those kiddish games are ideal to hide the discovery of one's own personal 
mediocrity / incapability in coding issues.

There are people who ask themselves why Manu A. still owes a repository at 
linuxtv.org. I guess this runs under "utilitarianism of human beings".

And also: a huge mass of (inactive) nominal members looks nice for a career at 
redhat.com, doesn't it?
