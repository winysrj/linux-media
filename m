As past maintainer of ivtv I can testify that I know at least one driver that

OK, I understand. And I assume both gfx and 3D acceleration need to use a
specific region? If they can use any type of memory, then this might be more
appropriate for kmalloc and friends.

When I said 'allocating X buffers of Y MB memory' I meant that you need to
allocate a known amount of memory (X * Y MB in this case). So the boot args
say e.g. dma=40MB and the driver just allocates X buffers from that region.

Switching to SD quality requires releasing those buffers and instead allocating
a number of smaller buffers from the same region.

For these use-cases the allocator can be very simple and probably covers most
use-cases.

Anyway, I'm no expert on memory allocators and people on the linux-mm list are
no doubt much more qualified to discuss this. My main concern is that of
trying to add too much for a first release. It is simply easier to start simple
and extend as needed. That makes it easier to be accepted in the mainline.

I have no idea why they have allocators. Someone would have to analyze that
code. Just because they use allocators doesn't necessarily mean that they
really need them :-)

You probably got the main interested parties now.

Regarding regions and shared and per-driver buffers: I've been thinking about this
a bit more and I have a proposal of my own.

There are two different aspects to this: first there is the hardware aspect: if
the hardware needs memory from specific memory banks or with specific requirements
(e.g. DMAable), then those regions should be setup in the platform code. There you
know the memory sizes/alignments/etc. since that is hw dependent. The other reason
is that drivers need to be able to tell CMA that they need to allocate from such
regions. You can't have a driver refer to a region that is specified through
kernel parameters, that would create a very ugly dependency.

The other aspect is how to setup buffers. A global buffer is simply setup by
assigning a size to the region: "banka=20MB". Unless specified otherwise any
driver that needs memory from banka will use that global banka buffer.

Alternatively, you can set aside memory from a region specifically for drivers:
banka/foo=30MB. This allocated 30 MB from region banka specifically for driver foo.

You can also share that with another driver:

banka/foo,bar=30MB

Now this 30 MB buffer is shared between drivers foo and bar.

The nice thing about this is that the driver will still only refer to region
banka as setup by the platform code.

And in the more general case you can have two standard regions: dma and common.
So drivers can rely on the presence of a dma region when allocating buffers.

What would make this even better is that CMA has the option to try and allocate
additional memory on the fly if its memory pool becomes empty. E.g. if the dma
pool is full, then it can try to do a kmalloc(..., GFP_KERNEL | __GFP_DMA).

This allows you to setup the dma and common regions with size 0. So allocating
from the dma region would effectively be the same as doing a kmalloc. Unless
the user sets up a dma area in the kernel parameters.

Obviously this is probably impossible if you need memory from specific memory
banks, so this is something that is not available for every region.

The nice thing about this is that it is very flexible for end users. For example,
most users of the ivtv driver wouldn't have to do anything since most of the time
it is able to assign the necessary buffers. But some users have multiple ivtv-based
capture boards in their PC, and then it can become harder to have ivtv obtain the
needed buffers. In that case they can preallocate the buffers by setting
dma/ivtv=500MB or something like that.

That would be a really nice feature...
