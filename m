Hi All,

I'm re-submitting this patch on behalf of Hans Verkuil, who currently
is unavailable for kernel work due to personal circumstances and has asked
me to get this patch upstream for 3.4-rc1.

This patch has been posted and discussed multiple times, a previous version
has been reviewed by Al Viro and his comments have been addressed in this
version. Getting this patch upstream is long overdue esp. since it has not
had any negative feedback. The only problem is that it is unclear through
which tree this patch should go upstream, the last discussion on this
subject was here:
http://lkml.indiana.edu/hypermail/linux/kernel/1202.0/01341.html

Regards,

Hans
