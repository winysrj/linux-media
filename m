This has been discussed a fair bit internally recently and some of our
GPU experts have raised concerns that this may result in seriously
degraded performance in our proprietary graphics stack. Now I don't care
very much for the proprietary graphics stack, but by extension I would
assume that the same restrictions are relevant for any open-source
driver as well.

I'm still trying to fully understand all the implications and at the
same time get some of the people who raised concerns to join in this
discussion. As I understand it the concern is mostly about explicit vs.
implicit synchronization and having this mechanism in the kernel will
implicitly synchronize all accesses to these buffers even in cases where
it's not needed (read vs. write locks, etc.). In one particular instance
it was even mentioned that this kind of implicit synchronization can
lead to deadlocks in some use-cases (this was mentioned for Android
compositing, but I suspect that the same may happen for Wayland or X
compositors).
