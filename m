someone's in a good mood today ;-)

What you seem to have missed is that sched.h doesn't include wait.h, it
includes completion.h and completion.h needs wait.h due the
wait_queue_head_t it uses.

If someone finds a cleaner way to drop that need, then I'm all for it as
my original suggestion to the original patch was to include sched.h in
wait.h, but it turned out that it's not possible due to the reasons
already explained.
