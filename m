Hi Markus,
        
I have a TerraTec Cinergy HTC USB XS HD stick and more than 10 years of
experience with Linux (drivers).
        
This USB stick works fine under Windows, but I need it under Linux
for my MythTV experiments in DVB-C mode.
        
Can I help you in the cleanup of the Linux driver for this device?
        
Kind regards,
        
Ad Denissen
