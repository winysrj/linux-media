Dear Friend,

I have a business proposal for you that will be of mutual benefit to
both of us. It=E2=80=99s about the death of my late client and some money h=
e
left behind before his death. I want you to stand as his next of kin
since you bear the same surname with him, so that the bank can
release/transfer his money to you as his next of kin. Contact me for
more details contact us via our official email address
(henryw683@gmail.com)

Barrister Henry Williams
