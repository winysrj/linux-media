Hi Steven,
I was too curious to wait for you and Antti to settle your differences, 
so I tested again against a 4.2-RC2
I did not disable DVB-T/T2, instead I reordered the lot. MythTV just 
sees the first system in the .delsys line in si2168.c,
so when it looks like this:
SYS_DVBC_ANNEX_A, SYS_DVBT, SYS_DVBT2
I'm good.

Result:
With your patch both MythTV and Tvheadend still can't tune. Without it, 
everything is ok.

I'm not very interested in czap results, only in real use cases. For me 
that's MythTV, but just to be sure I also tested with TVheadend.

Regards,
Tycho.
