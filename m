The CPU is the _controlling_ component - it's the component that has to
configure the peripherals so they all talk to each other in the right
way.  Therefore, the view of it needs to be CPU centric.

If we were providing a DT description for consumption by some other
device in the system, then the view should be as seen from that device
instead.

Think about this.  Would you describe a system starting at, say, the
system keyboard, and branching all the way through just becuase that's
how you interact with it, or would you describe it from the CPUs point
of view because that's what has to be in control of the system.
