Hi Stefan,

To be clear, I don't think anyone is actually proposing that the
driver version number really be used as any form of formal "ABI
versioning" scheme.  In almost all cases, it's so the application can
know to *not* do something is the driver is older than X.

Given all the cases I've seen, it doesn't really hurt anything if the
driver contains a fix from newer than X, aside from the fact that the
application won't take advantage of whatever feature/functionality the
fix made work.  In other words, I think from a backport standpoint, it
usually doesn't *hurt* anything if a fix is backported without the
version being incremented, aside from applications not knowing that
the feature/fix is present.

Really, this is all about applications being able to jam a hack into
their code that translates to "don't call this ioctl() with some
particular argument if it's driver W less than version X, because the
driver had a bug that is likely to panic the guy's PC".  Sure, it's a
crummy solution, but at this point it's the best that we have got.

Devin
