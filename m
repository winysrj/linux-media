Ok, I added the above logic and merged the corresponding patch
upstream.

Unfortunately, the only DVB-T2 signal I have is simple: it doesn't
have any subcel IDs. Yet, the first transport (4061) has two
cell IDs (I added an extra debug prints to identify it (as, currently,
we're not storing the cell ID anywhere):
	CELL ID= 6101
	freq = 64200000
	CELL ID= 0457
	freq = 65000000

So, except for the subcel parsing, patch looks OK:

Gregor,

I'll cherry-pick the corresponding patches to the stable branch.


Thanks,
Mauro
