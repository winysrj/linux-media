The phandle references (as3645a_flash and as3645a_indicator) should
actually be moved to the patch adding the flash property to the sensor
device node. It doesn't do anything here, yet.

That's right.

In the current patch, the device node of the flash controller is used,
postfixed with colon and the name of the LED ("flash" or "indicator") if
no label is defined. In other words, with that DT source you'll have
"as3645a:flash" and "as3645a:indicator". So if you change the name of
the device node of the IÂ²C device, that will be reflected in the label.

If a label exists, then the label is used as such.

I don't really have objections to what you're proposing as such but my
question is: is it useful? With that, the flash and indicator labels
will not come from DT if label properties are undefined. They'll always
be "as3645a:flash" and "as3645a:indicator", independently of the names
of the device nodes.
