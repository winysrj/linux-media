The value for the indicator is maximum as well, not just a recommendation.

The indicator is independent of the flash LED in V4L2 flash API. At
least that's how it should be, and in adp1653 the two are independent,
but the as3645a can't use indicator with the flash AFAIR.

Interesting idea.

The flash controller is still a single I2C device with common set of
faults, for instance. Some devices refuse to work again in case of
faults until they are cleared (= read).

Could the indicator pattern control be present in the same sub-device?

Are there any flash LED controllers that support such functionality?

Let me reply this separately. Feel free to ping me if I obviously appear
to miss something.
