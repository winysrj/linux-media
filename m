supply_nasty() would be used to define a regulator which is enabled by
the boot loader when it shouldn't be, which is the actual problem.

We have a regulator which is enabled by the boot loader. However, this
regulator shouldn't be on at boot since it's not needed by any devices
--- the drivers for those devices will use proper regulator framework
calls to use the regulator when it's needed. There's no chance to have
the boot loader fixed, as stated by Kalle.

How should this regulator be turned off in the boot by the kernel?
