Subject: [PATCH v4 1/5] dt-bindings: media: adv7604: Extend bindings to allow specifying slave map addresses

The ADV7604 has thirteen 256-byte maps that can be accessed via the main
I2C ports. Each map has it own I2C address and acts as a standard slave
device on the I2C bus.

Extend the device tree node bindings to be able to override the default
addresses so that address conflicts with other devices on the same bus
may be resolved at the board description level.

v2:
 - DT Binding update separated from code change
 - Minor reword to commit message to account for DT only change.
 - Collected Rob's RB tag.

v3:
 - Split map register addresses into individual declarations.

v4:
 - Collect Laurents RB tag
 - Adapt commit title
 - Normalise I2C usage (IÂ²C is harder to grep for)
