thank you for your comments.:) and below are some tables about dmabuf
operations with ideal use and these tables indicate reference count of
when buffer is created, shared and released. so if there are any
problems, please let me know. P.S. these are just simple cases so
there would be others.


in case of using only drm gem and dmabuf,

operations                       gem refcount    file f_count   buf refcount
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1. gem create                   A:1                                   A:0
2. export(handle A -> fd)    A:2                A:1              A:0
3. import(fd -> handle B)    A:2, B:1         A:2              A:1
4. file close(A)                  A:2, B:1         A:1              A:1
5. gem close(A)                A:1, B:1         A:1              A:1
6. gem close(B)                A:1, B:0         A:1              A:0
7. file close(A)                  A:0                A:0
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
3. handle B shares the buf of handle A.
6. release handle B but its buf.
7. release gem handle A and dmabuf of file A and also physical memory region.


and in case of using drm gem, vb2 and dmabuf,

operations                  gem, vb2 refcount    file f_count   buf refcount
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1. gem create                   A:1                 A:0
   (GEM side)
2. export(handle A -> fd)    A:2                 A:1              A:0
   (GEM side)
3. import(fd -> handle B)    A:2, B:1          A:2              A:1
   (VB2 side)
4. file close(A)                  A:2, B:1          A:1              A:1
   (VB2 side)
5. vb2 close(B)                 A:2, B:0          A:1              A:0
   (VB2 side)
6. gem close(A)                A:1                A:1              A:0
   (GEM side)
7. file close(A)                  A:0                A:0
   (GEM side)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
3. vb2 handle B is shared with the buf of gem handle A.
5. release vb2 handle B and decrease refcount of the buf pointed by it.
7. release gem handle A and dmabuf of file A and also physical memory region.
