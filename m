hmm, strange, since we got a different report too.

Thomas, thanks for reply. Looking closer now you are right.
It came not in over you, but Mike picked it up from Benoit.

saa7134-dvb: fix tuning for WinTV HVR-1110

From: Benoit Istin <beistin@gmail.com>

There are several months my hvr1110 stop working.
This is very simple to fix, for my card revision at least, by setting a
missing field to the hauppauge_hvr_1110_config.

I must have noticed that it is still missing for analog then.

Anders already gave the debug options he does set.

sorry for mine too.

On some cards LNA config 1 seems to make a difference and on others not
or is it only because already broken? Maybe we have different card
versions too, but you provided initial support for it and your report of
course still counts.

Under normal conditions you should expect that such cards are working
without any glitches. If your reception overall is on some limit, it is
somehow normal that one transponder starts to fail at first more
visible, if you have some glitches on the others already.

The sensitivity is not fully linear over the whole spectrum. I see this
on other tuners too, but the flaw there starts on different frequencies.

The antenna has of course an important role too and all sorts of RF
amplifiers involved. The other case is also often reported from other
cards already. It might happen, if close to the transmitter, that one
might need an attenuator.

Maybe try Anders' patch on recent.

Cheers,
Hermann
