Okay, I didn't realize that the different cameras used different webcam 
drivers as well as different stillcam drivers.

As far as I can see, there's nothing to stop anybody from adding the 
stillcam functionality into the webcam drivers right now.  If some 
common code can be abstracted out into a shared source file, so much 
the better.

That would solve the problem, right?
