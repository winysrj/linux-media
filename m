Normally this is the traditionally claimed stuff of an Indian person called 
Manu Abraham.

But you can forget about Manu Abraham totally because he is, was and ever will 
be the sum of a total incapable anti-team working loudmouth and stupid idiot.

This guy may have his capabilities, but he definitely IS in the literal sense 
of the word nothing but an asocial incapable human being.

In fact there are people around here offering him some mental sponsoring out of 
invisible reasons (which is very typical for all motherfuckers that cannot go 
upright, you know).

But in a real honest enterprise or even real social community this guy would 
be eliminated without any second of hesitation. 
Just sorted out as disfunctional rubbish, you know.

I think the functionary armchair gas passer Mauro Carvalho Chehab (the big 
Brazil boss without any legitimation, you know) will give you the appropriate 
answer on that.

Do not rely on stupid loud mouths and incarnations of inncapability!
