They're just discussions, and proposed patches (AKA: RFC).
So, they were tagged as such. I use superseded when a new version of a
normal patch is in patchwork. RFC is used there for patches meant for someone
to test and give a feedback. That's the case of those all 4 patches.

In any case, the practical effect is that patches that aren't "New" or
"Under review" don't appear on my quilt queue anymore.
