So to convert the dma_request_slave_channel_compat() and not to create _reason
variant?

Or to have single API to request channel? The problem with that is that we
need different parameters for legacy and DT for example.

Yes, it make sense to get rid if the _reason() things and have the
dma_request_slave_channel() and dma_request_slave_channel_compat() return with
error code

One thing we need to do for this is to change the error codes coming back from
the _dt() and _acpi() calls when we boot in legacy mode. Right now the only
error code which comes back is -ENODEV and -EPROBE_DEFER. We need to
differentiate between 'real' errors and from the fact that we did not booted
with DT or the ACPI is not available.
IMHO if we boot with DT and the channel request fails with other than
-EPROBE_DEFER we should not go and try to get the channel via legacy API.
