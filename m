Hi,
    I don't have yet the buggy config, but the steps I was following
when I encounter the problem were the following:
         hg clone http://linuxtv.org/hg/v4l-dvb
         cd v4l-dvb
         make menuconfig
          (I mostly uncheck here most of the modules, as I really was
needing only to compile the support for Nova-T 500 and an HVR-3000. I
just leave "as is" (checked as M by default) all the SAA7134 and
derived options).
         make && make install

Best regards,
  Eduard

PS: I suspect that "make allmodconfig" (which I didn't even  know it
existed...) makes a difference here, because it will mark CX88_MPEG as
'M', if I understand it well. I wasn't using it, so maybe this
explains why the option was hiddenly marked as 'Y' instead of 'M'.
