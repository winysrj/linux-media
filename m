My concern is about vb2 starting using the lock in existing helpers used by 
the uvcvideo driver. I suppose we can deal with it later.

I've looked at that, and there's a race condition in vb2_fop_poll() (for which 
I've already sent a patch) and possible in vb2_mmap() (raised the issue on 
#v4l today) as well that need to be fixed first.

Anyway, for this patch

Have you tested it by the way ?

Should I take it in my tree or will you send a pull request for the whole 
series ?
