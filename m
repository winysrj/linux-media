This is becoming annoying. Andrew, Al, can one of you please Ack this patch or 
review it? We *really* need this enhancement for our v4l drivers. I've been 
asking for an ack (or review) for ages and for the most part I got radio 
silence. Jon Corbet has already reviewed the code in early July (!), so I 
don't see why this is taking so long.

Mauro needs an ack from one of you before he can merge it.

Regards,

	Hans
