Tom,

Just a note: please don't top post.  Per list convention, please just
respond in-line.

Well, that's a new one on me.

So since vmalloc addresses are used for dynamic kernel mappings for
things like loadable module code and for IO mappings, 128 MB of
addresses will never be sufficient to support two cards that want 64 MB
of addresses each, along with other kernel vmalloc needs.

So until this problem is resolved, you won't get the second card
running.  The good news is, the problem appears to be fixable with the
proper kernel configuration.

The driver did make some suggestions in it's original error message:

both of which you could try.  They involve building a custom kernel.

There may be other ways, but I'm no expert in Linux memory management.
I suspect someone over on the LKML is.

To help solve your problem, people will likely need to see the output of
'cat /proc/meminfo' and 'dmesg' for your system.  If I had that info, I
could try to help, I'm not sure I'd be able to help effectively.


Regards,
Andy
