Along this line, I picked up a few set-top boxes from Circuit City
(going out of business here in the States), and I've been trying to get
them working as a VOD client.

They're labeled "MediaEdge STB-3", manufactured by Canopus, and they are
running (as far as I can tell) a RedHat-based fully open OS (root
password provided).  They have a Sigma Designs EM8621L-F video chip
onboard, and the CPU is an AMCC PowerPC PPC440EP chip.  The Circuit City
models have DVI-D, component, and composite output (other models also
include S-Video), and they solely use IP input.  There's no local
onboard storage, though there is smbclient support; I also wonder about
whether it's possible to enable the PowerPC chip's USB support with
simple addition of a header on the MoBo (there are various lands and
pads available for header-style connections).

According to the manufacturer (including from some tech specs they
release) the STB-3 supports MPEG 2 SD and HD video and audio playback
(among other formats), and they use RTSP for the delivery.

Normally, Canopus sells an expensive proprietary Microsoft Windows
software-based server, and they also manufacture a hardware real-time
encoder (ï»¿model LEB-60; video in & IP-delivered MPEG 1/2/4 out), so I'm
somewhat confident that it's likely possible to get this STB to play
VODs and/or live streams from open-source VOD servers or real-time
encoders (a la VLC capture/stream mode or similar).

I can easily create a normal web page (with examples from Canopus) that
the STB will display, and I can use the remote to browse and select
content, but so far I can't get the STB to actually play the content.  

Anyone interested in poking around inside of a unit to get VOD and
streaming working?  I could provide remote telnet/ssh access to the box
(it has built-in servers) or ship one if need be...

I'm especially interested in this because Circuit City is disposing of
all of their client units so I expect there will be plenty available for
little money, but they won't sell the server software because it's on a
leased server that's going back to the vendor.

By the way, these STB-3 models are not designed to be consumer models;
they are actually sold specifically configured for each customer that
buys in bulk (hence the Circuit City models missing the S-video
support).  That said, it seems the platform is stable enough to reliably
use either in a business environment or as a personal/home VOD client.
