Hi,

When I download the linux drivers for tbs dtv dvb cards, a lot of the
driver code is open source, with just a small bit being closed source.
Is there any effort to get all the open source parts of the driver
into linux mainline?
If I submitted a patch against the latest linux git kernel, would it
get accepted?
If we could get a majority of the driver code into the mainline
kernel, users would only have to install a very small part from the
closed source blob.
I think this would make life a lot easier for everyone.

What do you think?

Kind Regards

James
