Sorry about that.  It's a bug in the code which was caught later on.  The
code should read “__free_page(pfn_to_page(start))”.

When CMA uses this function, it requires all pages in the range to be valid
and free.  (Both conditions should be met but you never know.)  This change
adds a second way isolate_freepages_range() works, which is when freelist is
not specified, abort on invalid or non-free page, but continue as usual if
freelist is provided.

I can try and restructure this function a bit so that there are fewer “gotos”,
but without the above change, CMA won't really be able to use it effectively
(it would have to provide a freelist and then validate if pages on it are
added in order).
