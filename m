To save everyone's time I'll repost the original description of it:

This patchset contains a driver for a Silicon Laboratories 476x series
of radio tuners. The driver itself is implemented as an MFD devices
comprised of three parts: 
 1. Core device that provides all the other devices with basic
functionality and locking scheme.
 2. Radio device that translates between V4L2 subsystem requests into
Core device commands.
 3. Codec device that does similar to the earlier described task, but
for ALSA SoC subsystem.

v8 of this driver has following changes:
   - checkpatch.pl fixes

Pleas note that patches are not completely warning free, as far as
checkpatch.pl is concerned, because I skipped all the places where
80-character compliance can be acheived only by means of weird
indentation.
