humn... I don't think so. It would work perfectly well for firmware,
but for modules there are more things involved like fulfilling
dependencies, soft-dependencies, aliases and the like. It would create
several regressions.

They wanted to pass a fd instead of a buffer. That is being done in
the new finit_module syscall being discussed:
