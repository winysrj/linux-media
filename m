Thanks for comments, Maarten and Daniel.

I think I understand as your comment but I don't think that I
understand fully the dma-fence mechanism. So I wish you to give me
some advices for it. In our case, I'm applying the dma-fence to
mali(3d gpu) driver as producer and exynos drm(display controller)
driver as consumer.

And the sequence is as the following:
In case of producer,
1. call fence_wait to wait for the dma access completion of others.
2. And then the producer creates a fence and a new reservation entry.
3. And then it sets the given dmabuf's resv(reservation_object) to the
new reservation entry.
4. And then it adds the reservation entry to entries list.
5. And then it sets the fence to all dmabufs of the entries list.
Actually, this work is to set the fence to the reservaion_object of
each dmabuf.
6. And then the producer's dma start.
7. Finally, when the dma start is completed, we get the entries list
from a 3d job command(in case of mali core, pp job) and call
fence_signal() with each fence of each reservation entry.

>From here, is there my missing point?

And I thought the fence from reservation entry at step 7 means that
the producer wouldn't access the dmabuf attaching this fence anymore
so this step wakes up all processes blocked. So I understood that the
fence means a owner accessing the given dmabuf and we could aware of
whether the owner commited its own fence to the given dmabuf to read
or write through the fence's flags.

If you give me some advices, I'd be happy.

Thanks,
Inki Dae
