Hi,

Here is a "small" series that mostly cleans up the ov5640 driver code,
slowly getting rid of the big data array for more understandable code
(hopefully).

The biggest addition would be the clock rate computation at runtime,
instead of relying on those arrays to setup the clock tree
properly. As a side effect, it fixes the framerate that was off by
around 10% on the smaller resolutions, and we now support 60fps.

This also introduces a bunch of new features.

Let me know what you think,
Maxime

Changes from v1:
  - Integrated Hugues' suggestions to fix v4l2-compliance
  - Fixed the bus width with JPEG
  - Dropped the clock rate calculation loops for something simpler as
    suggested by Sakari
  - Cache the exposure value instead of using the control value
  - Rebased on top of 4.17
