Thank you for the update. This is good news indeed.

However, this was only an example to illustrate the main point:
the leadership problem in linux dvb.

The fact that, after years of parallel and uncoordinated development,
everyone (Manu, now Antti) suddenly feel the urgent need to merge
everything is another illustration of this lack of leadership.
"Bazaar" development has never been a synonym for "uncoordinated"
development. Call it leadership or "coordinatorship", we just need it.
