Even if CMA doesn't end up using genalloc, there are existing consumers of
the API and I think the _aligned function has value.

I agree that allocate_resource isn't overly heavy, but comparatively genalloc
is really simple and lightweight for a driver to manage a contiguous address
space without a lot of extra thought. I think both APIs serve slightly
different masters, but if somebody thought about it long enough there could
be some consolidation (same goes for the internal guts of
dma_declare_coherent_memory).

I agree with Michal - if genalloc goes deprecated, then so be it, but as
long as it lives, I think its useful to get these functions upstream.
