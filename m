I can't recommend a stick but just wanted to tell you to stay away from
the MSI DIGIVOX mini (II?) Hybrid (S36-0400132-K36).

It's an Afatech/ITE AF9035 + Xceive XC3028L + Micronas/Trident AVF4910B
design. It may be easy to get DVB-T working thanks to Antti's work on
the AF9035, but like you I'm more interested in analog tv and Trident
has ignored all my attempts at getting in contact with them.

Unfortunately they just bought NXP's TV/STB business...

  Daniel
