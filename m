Hmm indeed...
I see that the 2168 wants a mux i2c adapter..
and yep my /boot/config-3.10.0-229.14.1.el7.x86_64/ is indeed showing 
that CONFIG_I2C_MUX is commented out..
sigh.. Rebuilding the kernel with that setting on...
Why this is disabled rather than just a module is beyond me..
Curious that an error doesn't pop up about that..
Is there a debug level that can be turned on that would show that up?

Well spotted Tycho
Will let you know how things go
