Then as I suggested earlier, let's just add 'sync-on-green-active' DT
property for that. I wouldn't expect the DT properties to be directly
replacing your driver platform_data members. Saying in the binding that
this is a normal operation and that is an inverted one is not very useful
in general, as you would need to dig in the binding's description what
"normal" exactly means. sync-on-green-active = <1>; seems much more
explicit than, e.g. sync-on-green-inverted. By looking at the
sync-on-green-active property each device driver would determine whether
it means normal or inverted operation for its device.
