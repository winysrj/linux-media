Actually that is harmless.

When you need to unmap a DMA-buf because of mmu_invalidate_range or 
shrink_slab you need to wait for it's reservation object anyway.

This needs to be done to make sure that the backing memory is now idle, 
it doesn't matter if the jobs where submitted by DMA-buf importers or 
your own driver.

The sg tables pointing to the now released memory might live a bit 
longer, but that is unproblematic and actually intended.

When we would try to destroy the sg tables in an mmu_invalidate_range or 
shrink_slab callback we would run into a lockdep horror.

Christian.
