Hi, folks:

I would like to voice my support for Hans' patch.

1) The functionality provided by this patch is needed.  I have been 
involved in an app that implements a use-land sockets (using FUSE). 
Passing the accurate poll events is essential in the app.  We have been 
using a local patch that is similar (but not identical) for more than a 
year.  IMO the functionality of passing accurate and consistent events 
to a driver is basic, and should be provided by Linux.

2) The patch is safe as far as I can tell.  Without the patch, unwanted 
events may be passed to a driver. However once the poll returns to the 
kernel, the unwanted events would be masked out by the kernel anyway and 
would not be passed to an app.  Thus a driver that relies on the 
unwanted events would not work anyway.

Thanks.   -- Enke
