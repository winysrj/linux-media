Subject: Hauppauge PVR-150 Vertical sync issue?

I have a PVR-150 card running on mythbuntu 9 and it appears that my
card is suffering a vertical (and possibly a horizontal) sync issue.

The video jumps around, shifts from side to side, up and down and when
it shifts the video wraps. I'm including a link to a screen shot
showing the vertical sync problem

This is pretty tame to what happens sometimes. I haven't noticed this
on all channels as we are mostly using this to record shows for my
son.

Here is my setup. Pentium 4 2 Ghz with a gig of ram. 40 gig OS drive,
150 gig drive for recording, 250 gig drive for backup and storage, a
dvd-burner.
The 150 gig drive is on a Promise Ultra133 TX2 card but exhibits no
issues on reads or writes.
I have cable connected to the internal tuner of my PVR-150 card and
S-video from an Nvidia card (running Nvidea drivers) out to the TV.

I don't know what else I can provide to help out but let me know and
I'll get it.

Thanks,
-Rob
