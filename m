I had CONFIG_DVB_NET disabled, as a desktop system I didn't think
there was any need for it.  I tested with and without reverting
fcc8e7d8c0e2 and with and without CONFIG_DVB_NET enabled.  It always
worked if CONFIG_DVB_NET is enabled, it only works if CONFIG_DVB_NET
is disabled if fcc8e7d8c0e2 is reverted.  Thanks for the tip, you
saved me a whole lot of time trying to track down what was broken.
