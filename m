The dvb_usercopy will do the right thing, if we use _IOR or _IORW.

That is my understanding too. I agree that _IOWR seems to be the more appropriate
definition for it.

That's said, this is just a naming convention. Kernel core won't enforce
any special behavior, as there are some violations about this convention
on a few places.

I prefer to not apply this patch, as it won't fix anything. Adding an _OLD means
that we'll need later to remove it, causing a regression. Ok, we may do like we did
with V4L _OLD ioctl's that were marked as _OLD at 2.6.5 and were removed on a late
2.6.3x.

Cheers,
