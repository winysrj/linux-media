Hello everyone,

I'd like to refresh a little this thread as I have also bought this device and 
I'm willing to donate my time to make it working with Linux.

The bad news is that I am not familiar with Linux API (and device programming at 
all), so I can only offer myself for testing and gathering informations.

I have taken two high resolution pictures of this board.
As you (propably) know, it has 3 chips:
- Conexant 23102-11Z
- Conexant 24232-11Z
- NXP TDA18271 HDC2

The board is labeled UD412 if it makes any sense.

Pictures are on Picasa account: 
https://picasaweb.google.com/kamilkaminski000/GigabyteU8300?
authuser=0&authkey=Gv1sRgCID_5oOcsdXRpwE&feat=directlink
Both are 10MPix, you can zoom-in.

Device is still not recognized on Gentoo with 2.6.39-r3 (2.6.39.3) kernel.
It has same vendor id and device id (1b80:d416).

I have seen that there are drivers ready for tuner and for conexant chip. Is it 
really a problem to put them together?

I do not know where to start, and this thread is the only one Google shows.

I do not understand also the last message on thread, I have checked kernellabs 
code, but haven't seen my device in USB devices table for cx231xx. No cx2432 
also.

Best regards,
Kamil Kaminski
