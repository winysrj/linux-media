Hello Hermann,

I believe it makes sense for me to clarify this point:  Kernel Labs is
not affiliated with Hauppauge or PCTV in any way.  We have not
received any money from either company for Linux support for their
products.

One of Kernel Lab's long-term goals is indeed to find a way to provide
some form of commercial support for devices such as this.

It is probably fair to say that the three of us tend to focus on
products by those vendors because of easy access to sample hardware,
not because of any commercial arrangement.

That said, Kernel Labs is about as responsible for fixing the problem
as you are.  ;-)

Cheers,

Devin
