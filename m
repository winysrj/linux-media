Ok, now I am so sorry and I feel really silly but I can't find it.....

I have tried hauppauge.co.uk and under HVR-external all I get is 900HD, 
900, and 1400:

http://www.hauppauge.co.uk/site/products/prods_hvr_external.html

now, I even did a search for the 1900 and found nothing on hauppauge 
search link??? Sure it came up with the 1950 model but no 1900.

On top of that I tried www.dabs.com and www.misco.co.uk both of which 
have the 900 but no 1900.....

am I missing something or have I just totally gone insane over the last 
few hours???
