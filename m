Hello,

in current wiki entries it is documented that HVR-939C-HD identifies
with usbId 2040:b130. Some days ago I bought a model that identifies
with id 2040:b131. Does anyone know more about that difference? Is
b131 compatible to b130? Can the new patches from Matthias Schwarzott
be applied here, too?

I'm interested in getting my new device supported. Is there anything I
can do to help developing the corresponding drivers (I'm software
developer but have less experience with linux-kernel/drivers hacking)?

regards,
Christoph
