You may need to add it anyway, as the device may not be equal to
Siano Nice reference board.

No. there's a parameter for the smsmdtv module to select the right
standard:

drivers/media/dvb/siano/smscoreapi.c:module_param(default_mode, int, 0644);

You need to pass "default_mode=6" for ISDB-T to work. Just renaming
the firmware won't work. Of course, the firmware name entry needs to be
filled.

Btw, adding both firmwares work, as the same device can likely be used
in Europe with DVB-T. So, maybe we can add some parameter there to specify
the default mode. Not sure if such change would be easy though.
