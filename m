Hello,

I'm trying to make a patch for a :zolid usb dvb-t receiver.
Like to try the "em28xx log parser" to decode the usbsnoop output.
According to:
http://www.linuxtv.org/wiki/index.php/Bus_snooping/sniffing
it has been out there at least once but so far no luck to find it.

So, the program or a link where to find would help.

Thanks,
  Marcel Stork (Netherlands)
