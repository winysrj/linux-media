Thanks for spotting this. Below are improved versions of the conversion
functions. Please let me know if you have any comments.

static inline
enum led_brightnessv4l2_flash_intensity_to_led_brightness(
                                         struct led_ctrl *config,
                                         u32 intensity)
{
         return ((intensity - config->min) / config->step) + 1;
}

static inline
u32 v4l2_flash_led_brightness_to_intensity(
                                         struct led_ctrl *config,
                                         enum led_brightness brightness)
{
         return ((brightness - 1) * config->step) + config->min;
}
