Argh! Perhaps we should make it depend on BROKEN while not fixed :-/

Grrr...

videobuf-vmalloc do DMA mapping for pages allocated via vmalloc(),
via vmalloc_user()/remap_vmalloc_range().

There aren't much drivers using VB1 anymore, but a change at VB2
will likely break support for almost all webcams if fs DAX is
in usage.

Before changeset 3336c24f25ec, the logic for get_user_pages() were
at drivers/media/v4l2-core/videobuf2-dma-sg.c. Now, the logic
it uses is inside mm/frame_vector.c.
