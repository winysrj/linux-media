I agree this. I'm thinking about expanding the ledtrig-camera.c
created by Milo Kim. This trigger will provide flashing and strobing
control of a LED device and for sure the LED device driver like
drivers/leds/leds-lm355x.c.

So we basically can do this:
1. add V4L2 Flash subdev into ledtrig-camera.c. So this trigger driver
can provide trigger API to kernel drivers as well as V4L2 Flash API to
userspace.
2. add the real flash torch functions into LED device driver like
leds-lm355x.c, this driver will still provide sysfs interface and
extended flash/torch control sysfs interface as well.

I'm not sure about whether we need some change in V4L2 internally. But
actually Andrzej Hajda's patchset is quite straightforward, but we
just need put those V4L2 Flash API into a LED trigger driver and the
real flash/torch operation in a LED device driver.

Milo, could you please give some comments here?

Thanks,
-Bryan
