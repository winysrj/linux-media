Should we change this to "via a main (also known as 'bridge') driver"?

To help understanding terminology that we use?

I'd say: "support the :ref:`media controller API <media_controller>` as well
in order to let the application know which device nodes are available.

This note should be moved up to the vdev-centric description. It's weird now
as it comes after the MC centric summary, but deals with a vdev-centric driver.
