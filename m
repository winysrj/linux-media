Just wondering: is alignment really needed since we already align to the

I would make this field internal only. At least for now.

This really should not be optional but compulsory. 'type' has the same function
as the GFP flags with kmalloc. They tell the kernel where the memory should be
allocated. Only if you do not care at all can you pass in NULL. But in almost
all cases the memory should be at least DMA-able (and yes, for a lot of SoCs that
is the same as any memory -- for now).

Memory types should be defined in the platform code. Some can be generic
like 'dma' (i.e. any DMAable memory), 'dma32' (32-bit DMA) and 'common' (any
memory). Others are platform specific like 'banka' and 'bankb'.

A memory type definition can either be a start address/size pair but it can
perhaps also be a GFP type (e.g. .name = "dma32", .gfp = GFP_DMA32).

Regions should be of a single memory type. So when you define the region it
should have a memory type field.

Drivers request memory of whatever type they require. The mapping just maps
one or more regions to the driver and the cma allocator will pick only those
regions with the required type and ignore those that do not match.

> +         }
> +         static const char map[] __initconst = "foo/a=a;foo/b=b;*=a,b";

So this would become something like this:

         static struct cma_memtype types[] = {
                 { .name = "a", .size = 32 << 20 },
                 { .name = "b", .size = 32 << 20, .start = 512 << 20 },
                 // For example:
                 { .name = "dma", .gfp = GFP_DMA },
                 { }
         }
         static struct cma_region regions[] = {
                 // size may of course be smaller than the memtype size.
                 { .name = "a", type = "a", .size = 32 << 20 },
                 { .name = "b", type = "b", .size = 32 << 20 },
                 { }
         }
         static const char map[] __initconst = "*=a,b";

No need to do anything special for driver foo here: cma_alloc will pick the
correct region based on the memory type requested by the driver.

It is probably no longer needed to specify the memory type in the mapping when
this is in place.

This would be something for the driver to decide. If the driver can handle
this, then the driver should just try memtype "a" first, and then "b".

The only change needed here is that the region gets a '.type = "dma"' specifier

I think I am otherwise quite happy with this code (as least from the PoV of
v4l). But that 'memory kind' handling never felt like it was handled at the
right level.
