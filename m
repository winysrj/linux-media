Oh, Sorry, I see it now.

Now there is two options.

Either;

1) Move fe->tuner_priv = state to below line 287, so it can be released
by ix2505v_release and fe->tuner_priv returned to NULL;

2) or not calling ix2505v_release changing line 314 to kfree(state).
fe->tuner_priv will remain NULL through out.

Currently, tuner_write_only is not implemented in the dvb-usb-lmedm04
driver, as sometimes it returned unpredictable results, and wrongly
failed to attach the tuner. Although, I will test it again.
