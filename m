I still hope to avoid doing that. All in-kernel users should be changed to
use timespec64 or ktime_t, which are always more efficient and accurate.

For the system call interface, all timeval APIs are deprecated and have
replacements using timespec64 (e.g. clock_gettime() replaces gettimeofday).

Only a handful of ioctls pass timeval, and so far my impression is that
we are better off handling each one separately. The total amount of code
we need to add this way should be less than if we have to duplicate all
common code functions that today operate on timeval and can eventually
get removed.

Ok.
