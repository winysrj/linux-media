I don't think any other device has used the SAA7113 together with a digital demod.  Most products seem to only have the SAA711X on an analog only board.  Since I don't have any other USB adapters with the SAA chip I was unable to do any further testing on the SAA code changes.

IIRC, a couple of the Sasem/OnAir devices use a saa7113 together with a
digital demod. I seem to also recall something else, though maybe I'm
mistaken.
