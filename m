another possibility would be to just leave it open in the generic
bindings:

"Two endpoints are considered linked together if any of them contains a
 'remote-endpoint' phandle property that points to the other. If both
 contain a 'remote-endpoint' property, both must point at each other."

As long as we make sure that the generic code is able to generate the
undirected graph from this, we could then let more specific bindings
(like video-interfaces.txt) define that the phandle links always should
point in both directions, in data flow direction, north, or outwards
from the 'master'.
