Hi,

in an earlier post I was responded to that my old WinTV USB 1 Tuner 
would never work under Linux due to bad and complicated coding which 
(since no one uses that tuner anymore) will never be looked at.

So I am in need of a new tuner!

This is a dilemma as I need analog TV.... since I will be using it for 
watching stuff through a satellite receiver but also analog terrestrial 
TV too as where I will be taking it to doesn't have digital TV at best 
the have cable.
 
I was considering going for the Hauppauge WinTV HVR-900HD. I am not sure 
if it will be compatible though with the global regions I will use it in 
which is UK that I know it has support for as I will buy from here which 
is PAL I but then also Turkey which I think is PAL Beta if I'm not 
mistaken??
 
More importantly though is it supported under Linux?? I use KUbuntu 9.04 
which is pretty up to date. I am just a bit worried about this part 
since the site says that as of June 2008 there is no support... of 
course we are in August 2009 so maybe in a year it might have been 
integrated into the later kernels??

What's everyone's verdict? Any suggestions would be great!
