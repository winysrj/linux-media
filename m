That's correct, and that's why the driver is going to staging. From there it 
will be incrementally fixed and then moved to drivers/media/, or dropped if 
not maintained.

I agree that it would be the best thing to do, but I don't think it's going to 
happen. We need to decide between two options.

- Push back now and insist in incremental patches for the existing driver, and 
get nothing back as TI will very likely give up completely.
- Accept the driver in staging, get it fixed incrementally, and finally move 
it to drivers/media/

There's a political side to this issue, we need to decide whether we want to 
insist vendors getting everything right before any code reaches mainline, in 
which case I believe we will lose some of them in the process, including major 
vendors such as TI, or if we can make the mainline learning curve and 
experience a bit more smooth by accepting such code in staging.

I would vote for the second option, with a very clear rule that getting the 
driver in staging is only one step in the journey: if the development effort 
stops there, the driver *will* be removed.
