I quite agree, which is exactly why I posted without a patch at first.

I did exactly that when I had access to the card a year and a half ago. No
go. BTW, in my earlier message, "nineteen months" should have read
"thirty-one months" ago.

As I said, that was the first thing I did. After trying all the x502
and/or CardBus permutations, I gave up. Yesterday, I finally turned RegSpy
loose on the Windows driver, and found that "card=39" matches its behavior
exactly.

I would not have posted without checking that. Again, "card=39" is the
only thing that makes everything work correctly, and then only if the v4l
app uses an audio sampling rate of 32000 instead of the 48000 default.

That's what I posted. The reason I added 30 and 34 was that the Windows
.inf file has them, probably on a just-in-case basis. There is no mention
there of a 4E42/1502 combination there, though.

The 0502 definition is incorrect for this card, due to its GPIO use. The
Mini definition _is_ correct for it, in every way possible.
