A per-driver version only works if the user is running a vanilla kernel without 
any stable patches applied. 

I doubt that this covers the large amount of the users: they'll either use an 
stable patched kernel or a distribution-specific one. On both cases, the driver
version is not associated with a bug fix, as the driver maintainers just take
care of increasing the driver version once per each new kernel version (when
they care enough).

Also, a git blame for the V4L2 drivers shows that only a few drivers have their
version increased as changes are applied there. So, relying on cap->version 
has a minimal chance of working only with a few drivers, with vanilla *.0 kernels.

Anyway, I think that we should at least apply the enclosed patch, and remove
KERNEL_VERSION and linux/version.h includes for the drivers that didn't change
its version in the past 2 kernel releases.

I'll work later on the linux/version.h cleanup patches.

Cheers,
Mauro

[media] v4l2-ioctl: Add a default value for kernel version

Most drivers don't increase kernel versions as newer features are added or
bug fixes are solved. So, vidioc_querycap returned value for cap->version is
meaningless. Instead of keeping this situation forever, let's add a default
value matching the current Linux version.

Drivers that want to keep their own version control can still do it, as they
can override the default value for cap->version.
