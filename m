Well, Rob asked some changes at the DT binding pathes. I'll tag the
patches as changes requested. Please re-submit the remaining ones after
fixing the pointed issues and getting his ack. Except for that, the
series look OK on my eyes.

Yes, you don't need to deal with time shifts there, nor with missing
events ;)

Well, using the encoders also for TX (as an another ioctl at LIRC) 
would require some extra bits to handle things like carrier frequency,
duty cycle, etc, but lirc should be able to handle those already.

So, a future patch expanding its usage to lirc would just need to
add the proper binding.

Btw, I just noticed that the LIRC UAPI interface is still at the
wrong place. It is at:
	include/media/lirc.h
but it should be at:
	include/uapi/.../lirc.h

I'm wandering why nobody didn't notice it yet when compiling
Lirc userspace... Perhaps userspace is just keeping a copy of
that file without any process to sync it from the Kernel userspace
headers.

Thanks for that!
