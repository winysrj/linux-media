Tim,

Please, do NOT top-post.  This is the policy of this mailing list.

I did not say that analog can not be supported.  I said that analog IS
not supported.

If somebody gets analog working, I'm sure that everybody will be happy
about it.  I'd like to see analog working on the cx23885 cards, too.
