I could review it and put it in there on a preliminary basis for some
runtime testing.  But the question in my mind is how different will the
code be after the problems which rmk has identified have been fixed?

If "not very different" then that effort and testing will have been
worthwhile.

If "very different" or "unworkable" then it was all for naught.

So.  Do we have a feeling for the magnitude of the changes which will
be needed to fix these things up?
