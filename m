The main reason is really that pushing the bkl into the v4l core makes it
easier to review. I noticed for example that this patch series forgot to change
the video_ioctl2 call in ivtv-ioctl.c to video_ioctl2_unlocked. And there may
be other places as well that were missed. Having so many drivers changed also
means a lot of careful reviewing.

But I will not block this change. However, I do think it would be better to
create a video_ioctl2_bkl rather than add a video_ioctl2_unlocked. The current
video_ioctl2 function *is* already unlocked. So you are subtle changing the
behavior of video_ioctl2. Not a good idea IMHO. And yes, grepping for
video_ioctl2_bkl is also easy to do and makes it more obvious that the BKL is
used in drivers that call this.
