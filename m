I tried in vain, several times, to get the VDR User to some ground.

To participate in development is about patches, as a minimum.

Driver maintainers are on a much higher level and can disregard patches.

If patches go to mainline, one has to allow to be authenticated.

There is no other way to get any "stuff" in else, with reasons.

If one is acting under some anonymous name and email account, there is
no way to fulfill this first requirement.

So, anything coming in from such, is taken as trolling.

Especially, if one did already qualify for "taking it all over", rule
the personal engaged and so on ...

I'm not sure, if we have to improve the wiki for those never ever
sending any patches, since this is the first on what we meet.

But some, taking it all over, seem still to be in urgent need about how
to improve that ;)

Cheers,
Hermann
