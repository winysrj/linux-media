Hi,

I have a Pinnacle PCTV DVB-S2 Stick (461e) and did connect it to a cubox-i 
running openelec.

The known issues on

http://linuxtv.org/wiki/index.php/Pinnacle_PCTV_DVB-S2_Stick_%28461e%29

seem to be gone (at least I did not hit them).

Instead there seems to be another (new?) issue, that HD streams have 
artefacts, see

http://forum.kodi.tv/showthread.php?tid=220129

and

https://tvheadend.org/boards/5/topics/19582?r=19584#message-19584

I tried to add that to the wiki, but my registration attempt was rejected.

Can somebody with write access to 
http://linuxtv.org/wiki/index.php/Pinnacle_PCTV_DVB-S2_Stick_%28461e%29 please 
add the new issue?

Certainly any hint how to solve this issue is welcome.

Thanks
Rainer
