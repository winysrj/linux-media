Hello Shahar,

A driver for this webcam is available (you may find it in the last
gspca version that I have just uploaded - 2.9.6 - the subdriver is
'gspca_tasc.ko').

The only problem is that nobody could yet decode the images! (Jens,
Jean-Yves, any news?)

About the list, all the linux video stuff is hosted at LinuxTv.org and
the linux-media mailing-list at vger.kernel.org (see Cc:).

Best regards.
