When a binding is limited to a single driver, review isn't critical.
When it is local to a single subsystem the bar is a little higher. Yes,
it should have had more review, but the surface area is still minimal.
By turning the binding into a generic pattern that all subsystems are
welcome to use the bar becomes higher still. It is not unreasonable for
a binding a new round of review when it is being adapted to become more
generic.

V4L2 can and should continue to use what it has. It certainly is not
okay to break existing platforms. All of my issues are directed toward
new users.

Despite my concerns, I do want this series to get merged in the next
merge window.
