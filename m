heh, IMO we shouldn't pass pointers of any kind through platform_data,
we want to pass data :-)

Allowing to pass pointers through that, is one of the reasons which got
us in such a big mess in ARM land, well it was much easier for a
board-file/driver writer to pass a function pointer then to create a
generic framework :-)

I'll agree with Greg here, the very fact that we see people trying to
add a requirement of *NOT* using PLATFORM_DEVID_AUTO already points to a
big problem in the framework.

The fact is that if we don't allow PLATFORM_DEVID_AUTO we will end up
adding similar infrastructure to the driver themselves to make sure we
don't end up with duplicate names in sysfs in case we have multiple
instances of the same IP in the SoC (or several of the same PCIe card).
I really don't want to go back to that.
