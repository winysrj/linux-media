Hi,

I have been having some difficulties getting my DVICO dual digital 4
(rev1) working with recent kernels, failing to tune and getting errors
like the following

kernel: [ 315.032076] dvb-usb: bulk message failed: -110 (4/0)
kernel: [ 315.032080] cxusb: i2c read failed

and making the machine very slow as documented at
https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux-meta/+bug/459523

Using the v4l-dvb tree, I was able to bisect the issue down to
http://linuxtv.org/hg/v4l-dvb/rev/7276a5854219

At first I though I could workaround the issue by setting no_poweroff=1,
but that did not work.  The following diff did however resolve the issue.

         int (*get_status)(struct dvb_frontend *fe, u32 *status);

This led me to dvb_frontend.c where I could see i2c_gate_ctrl() was being
called if .sleep was non zero.  Setting dvb_powerdown_on_sleep=0 worked
around the issue by stoppign i2c_gate_ctrl() being called, so I suspect
i2c_gate_ctrl() is triggering the issue somehow.

Any thoughts on a proper solution for this issue?
