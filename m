The allowed rc protocol field are there for devices with hardware IR
support, where only a limited set of remote protocols can be decoded.

For software decoders RC_BIT_ALL is the proper setup. Users of course
can change it via sysfs at runtime, or a software decoder may be
disabled at compilation time by not selecting its CONFIG_* var.

Why not? The rc_map name is used either by Kernelspace or by Userspace,
in order to provide the IR keycode name that matches a given keytable.

There's no plans to change it, even in the long term.
