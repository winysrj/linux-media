Also the documentation currently states in [1]:

  Drivers should not return an error code unless the type field is
 
invalid, this is a mechanism to fathom device capabilities and to
 
approach parameters acceptable for both the application and driver.Â

At least coda replaces incorrect pixelformat with a supported format.

coda currently doesn't support dynamically changing controls at all.

TRY_ENCODER_CMD can be used to check whether the hardware supports
things like V4L2_ENC_CMD_STOP_AT_GOP_END, I don't think this will be the
same for all codecs.
