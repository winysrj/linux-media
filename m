Yes. Someone at IRC were complaining about this device (his nick is
buxy81). According with the tests he did, with both patches his
device is now working.

That's said, it would be great if he could provide us more details
about the tests he did, with the logs enabled, in order for us to see
if the eeprom contents is properly read.


Thanks,
Mauro
