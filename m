Alan,

As I said, I am agnostic, though leaning in the direction that Hans de 
Goede is pointing. What he says about a single control mechanism seems to 
make a lot of sense. If you can come up with an outline of the "easier to 
code" solution, that would be interesting, though.

I assume you are also going to be in Vancouver? If you will be there on 
Monday, then Hans and I are already planning to meet and discuss. 

BTW, as to using V4L with "tweaks" to handle still mode, it would probably 
be more difficult than is imagined. For, though the operations required to 
process still images and webcam frames are in principle similar, the 
priorities and constraints are too different. Therefore, my understanding 
is that the libgphoto2 image processing routines, not the libv4l image 
processing routines, would still be used for still images.
