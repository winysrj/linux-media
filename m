Hi Ezequiel,

It is not a minor patch, but maybe you don't know about object
programming.

As it is defined, a gspca device _is_ a video device, as a gspca
subdriver is a gspca device, and as a video device is a device: each
lower structure is contained in a higher one.

Your patch defines the gspca structure as a separate entity which is
somewhat related to a video device by two reverse pointers. It
complexifies the structure accesses, adds more code and hides the
nature of a gspca device.

No, your patch does not help...
