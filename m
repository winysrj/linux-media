Hello Laurent, I'm glad to see that you are joining the thread :)

Yes, I'll cook a patch today on top on your omap3isp-yuv and send for
review. I won't be able to test neither since I don't have proper
hardware at home. But at least you will get an idea of the approach we
are using to solve this and can point possible flaws.
