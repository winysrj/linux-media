Thanks for the excellent discussion - it indeed is very good learning
for the relatively-inexperienced me :)

So, for the purpose of dma-buf framework, could I summarize the
following and rework accordingly?:
1. remove mmap() dma_buf_op [and mmap fop], and introduce cpu_start(),
cpu_finish() ops to bracket cpu accesses to the buffer. Also add
DMABUF_CPU_START / DMABUF_CPU_FINI IOCTLs?
2. remove sg_sync* ops for now (and we'll see if we need to add them
later if needed)

I guess that should be acceptable for our video / media use cases. How
about other potential users of dma-buf? [I am asking this because
Jesse did tell me that there were some other subsystems also
interested in dmabuf usage]
