This is a update on the current progress for the BKL removal, reflecting
what is currently in linux-next.

Maybe we can briefly discuss this at the kernel summit to decide if we
want a quick death of the BKL, i.e. fixing/disabling/staging-out the
remaining users in 2.6.38 or rather leave them there indefinitely.

Still open, no good solution for this.

Progressing well, patches are being worked on.

Nobody replied.

Now in staging.

Jan Harkes showed interest, looks like this will get fixed eventually,
but probably not in time for 2.6.37.

Still waiting for confirmation from Christoph Hellwig that the BKL
is not needed here. I can do the patch to remove it then.

No replies.

Bryan Schumaker took care of this, looks like the locking is independent
of the fs/locks.c locking now, although it still uses the BKL internally.

I assume that this will get fixed as well, doesn't seem hard. As long
as lockd uses the BKL, both nfs and nfsd depend on the BKL implicitly.

No longer blocked now, both lockd and ceph can deal with this converted
to spinlocks. I will follow up with the final patch once they hit mainline.

Fixed by Petr Vandrovec.

Anders Larsen volunteered.

Now in staging.

Jan Kara volunteered to do it.

No replies.

Done.

Samuel Ortiz fixed irda.

David Miller volunteered to do appletalk and ipx.

Patches have shown up in -next now, I suppose Andrew will finish it soon.

Out of the remaining modules, I guess i810/i830, adfs, hpfs and ufs might end
up not getting fixed at all, we can either mark them non-SMP or move them
to drivers/staging once all the others are done.
