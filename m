No. only the MMAP-based and OVERLAY-based ioctls could be deduced from the flags
there, plus hw freq seek. Anything else will be just a guess.

At the best, it is a hint coding.

The V4L1 compat layer required that some VIDIOC_G variants to be implemented for
some things to work. This code were moved to userspace, but the requirement is
probably still there.

In other words, drivers had/have no option but implementing some VIDIOC_G even
when VIDIOC_S is not supported.

So, changing the V4L2 spec to require that all 3 to be implemented will also 
cause compatibility issues that will be harder to map than the check for a proper
check of the EINVAL return code.

If driver foo returns ENOTTY because the device got removed and driver bar returns another
error, they're not consistent. Developers tried to get the errors that they considered to
be the more applicable to that situation, but, as different developers took different
decisions, the end result is that several error codes will need to be fixed^Wchanged, in
order to allow userspace to properly deal/report with such error conditions.

That's the price that a closed source app pays: we can't do much to detect or prevent 
breaking a closed source application. A simple driver patch may hurt those applications, 
and only the app developer can fix. On the other hand, closed-source applications have
a team of developers paid to keep their application working. So, if properly announced,
they can change their code in advance in order to check for the QUERYCAP version and
handle the new behaviour accordingly.

I think that we should take a look at the existing open source applications and see how
they handle -EINVAL, sending patches to them fixing the behaviour, if they're broken
by such change.
