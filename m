Dear linux-dvb users,

A long time ago, we've merged analog and digital ML's into just one list.
As result, a new mailing list were created, at kernel.org facilities, meant
to be used by those envolved on adding open source support on Linux for
all sorts of radio, analog TV, digital TV and webcam support. The traffic
at the video4linux and linux-dvb ML's were gradually moved to the new ML.

However, still today, people sometimes send useful messages to this ML, believing
that the list is still active. However, no developers are reading from this ML
anymore, and any comments send to this ML will probably be just not read.
The same were happening with video4linux ML.

To avoid frustating people that are sending messages to this ML, I'm removing all
subscribed users from this ML, and blocking and further subscriptions.

If you're interested on Linux DVB, please use linux-media@vger.kernel.org. 

To subscribe, all you need to do is to send a message to: majordomo@vger.kernel.org
with "subscribe linux-media" at the mail body.

More detailed info is available at:
	http://vger.kernel.org/vger-lists.html#linux-media

Thanks!
Mauro
