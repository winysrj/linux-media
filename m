This is not actually needed, as it is very easy to distinguish them when
doing the table lookups. Take a look at v4l-utils, at /utils/keytable/rc_keymaps:

A 16-bits NEC table:
	# table kworld_315u, type: NEC
	0x6143 KEY_POWER
	0x6101 KEY_VIDEO
	...

A 24-bits NEC table:
	# table pixelview_002t, type: NEC
	0x866b13 KEY_MUTE
	0x866b12 KEY_POWER2
	...

A 32-bits NEC table:
	# table tivo, type: NEC
	0xa10c900f KEY_MEDIA
	0xa10c0807 KEY_POWER2
	...

If you see there, there's no way for the Kernel to handle it wrong, as
there's an implicit rule when dealing with "extended NEC" protocols:

Being the IR code being given by: AA BB CC DD

On a 24-bit NEC table: AA is always different than ~BB, otherwise, it would
be a 16-bit NEC.

On a 32-bit NEC table: CC is always different than ~DD, otherwise, it would be
a 24-bit NEC.

The hard thing is that, if this is changed upstream, existing
tools/keytables will break. So, regressions will be introduced.

One alternative would be to add some compatibility code at the table
read function that would convert a 16 bits or 24 bits NEC keycode table
into a 32 bits one, but doing it right can be a problem.
