I agree with Jarod: The above hunk shouldn't go upstream, or else it would break _lots_ of
remotes.

This change is OK, though. Yet. due to precision issues, it is better to do a 64-bit
multiplication and use do_div for the division. This is compatible with 32 bits and 64
bits systems, and will reduce error noise at the duration.

I've reworked that part of the patch, as follows.

Thanks!
Mauro

Subject: [PATCH] [media] Fix cx88 remote control input

As pointed by Lawrence Rust <lvr@softsystem.co.uk>:

In the IR interrupt handler of cx88-input.c there's a 32-bit multiply
overflow which causes IR pulse durations to be incorrectly calculated.

This is a regression caused by commit 2997137be8eba.
