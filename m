When we added support for omap3, back in 2010, we added a new
type of V4L2 devices that aren't fully controlled via the V4L2
device node.

Yet, we have never clearly documented in the V4L2 specification
the differences between the two types.

Let's document them based on the the current implementation.

+
+Types of V4L2 media hardware control
+====================================
+
+A :term:`V4L2 hardware` is usually complex: support for it is
+implemented via a :term:`V4L2 main driver` and often by several
+additional :term:`drivers <driver>`.
+The main driver always exposes one or more
+:term:`V4L2 device nodes <v4l2 device node>`
+(see :ref:`v4l2_device_naming`) with are responsible for implementing
+data streaming, if applicable.
+
+The other drivers are called :term:`V4L2 sub-devices <v4l2 sub-device>`
+and provide control to other
+:term:`hardware components <hardware component>` are usually connected
+via a serial bus (like :term:`IÂ²C`, :term:`SMBus` or :term:`SPI`).
+Depending on the main driver, they can be implicitly
+controlled directly by the main driver or explicitly via
+the V4L2 sub-device API (see :ref:`subdev`).
+
+When **V4L2** was originally designed, the
+:term:`V4L2 device nodes <v4l2 device node>` served the purpose of both
+control and data interfaces and there was no separation
+between the two interface-wise. V4L2 controls, setting inputs and outputs,
+format configuration and buffer related operations were all performed
+through the same **V4L2 device nodes**. Devices offering such interface are
+called **V4L2 device node centric**.
+
+Later on, support for the :term:`media controller` interface was added
+to V4L2 in order to better support complex :term:`V4L2 hardware` where the
+**V4L2** interface alone could no longer meaningfully serve as both a
+control and a data interface. On such V4L2 hardware, **V4L2** interface
+remains a data interface whereas control takes place through the
+:term:`media controller` and :term:`V4L2 sub-device` interfaces. Stream
+control is an exception to this: streaming is enabled and disabled
+through the **V4L2** interface. These devices are called
+**Media controller centric**.
+
+**MC-centric** V4L2 hardware provide more versatile control of the
+hardware than **V4L2 device node centric** devices at the expense of
+requiring device-specific userspace settings.
+
+On **MC-centric** V4L2 hardware, the **V4L2 sub-device nodes**
+represent specific parts of the V4L2 hardware, to which they enable
+control.
+
+Also, the additional versatility of **MC-centric** V4L2 hardware comes
+with additional responsibilities, the main one of which is the requirements
+of the user configuring the device pipeline before starting streaming. This
+typically involves configuring the links using the **Media controller**
+interface and the media bus formats on pads (at both ends of the links)
+using the **V4L2 sub-device** interface.
