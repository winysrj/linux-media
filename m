I don't think that was designed for the case where the backing memory
is a special/static physical address range rather than anonymous
"System RAM", right?

I think we should handle the graphics P2P concerns separately from the
general P2P-DMA case since the latter does not require the higher
order memory management facilities. Using ZONE_DEVICE/DAX mappings to
avoid changes to every driver that wants to support P2P-DMA separately
from typical DMA still seems the path of least resistance.
