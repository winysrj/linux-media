Hello Everyone,

 

I have a few devices I'm trying to find more information on, from what I've
read out there, there is not much support for the ViXS 2100 series or the
ATI 550 Pro Chipsets.

 

I was wondering if anyone had any knowledge as to how to get these devices
working. 

 

Here is my LSPCI output:

 

04:00.0 Multimedia controller: ViXS Systems, Inc. XCode 2100 Series

1:05.0 Multimedia controller: ATI Technologies Inc Theater 550 PRO PCI [ATI
TV Wonder 550]

 

I've been messing with this issue for the past couple of weeks, with no
luck. If anyone out there knows anything please let me know ;) the cards are
nice and I'd like to be able to use them.

 

Thanks a bunch!

 

CSW
