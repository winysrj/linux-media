No, it doesn't.

First of all, the dmesg output available on pastebin.com is difficult to 
understand. As it seems you perform several suspend/resume cycles there. 
Mohamed, could you please

- clear the kernel log ('dmesg -c' as root)
- suspend and resume your system
- post the kernel log content ('dmesg')
- clear the kernel log
- try to use your webcam with whatever test software your prefer
- describe the failure (application error messages, ...)
- post the kernel log content

That's not a solution. Devices are supposed to resume properly without being 
reset. The camera might be crashing, or the USB core might be doing something 
wrong, requiring some kind of reset. I'd like to diagnose the problem 
correctly before trying to fix it.
