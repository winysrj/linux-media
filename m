So you are making yet another change to fix a bug, although you even
haven't identified yet what the bug is ?

You are ignoring what I said.

1.) If the current order would really be wrong, we would have bugs. But
we don't know any bugs caused by the current order.
2.) If you change the order, it is also necessary to wake up or even do
the whole setup again after each input switch (video_mux() call).
This patch misses this fix. So there is a chance that you are causing
regressions.
3.) We can always do this change later, but we likely can't revert it
anymore after a while (without retesting all device that have been added
in the meantime)

The whole gpio sequences stuff and its unknown effects on the
power/reset state of the subdevices has already turned em28xx
maintenance into a nightmare.
There is lots of problematic code which can never be fixed without
testing all ~100 devices.
Let's not walk needlessly into the same trap with yet another piece of code.
