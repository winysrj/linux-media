Ideally, the patches that are OK should already be catched by a driver
maintainer and submitted me via git or mercurial pull request, and the bad
patches should already be nacked. The ones that are not merged from the 
normal process are the ones that are not trivial, among others, due to one
of the reasons bellow:
	- there's no driver maintainer;
	- the driver maintainer is lazy or overloaded;
	- there are some concerns about that patch;
	- there are some changes undergoing that will affect/be affected by
	  the patch;
	- the patch got forgotten/lost in the middle of the emails.

The fact is that the number of those patches are very high, causes me a lot
of overload to handle them and to send emails to people requesting the review
of those patches.

Updated today, after two or three weeks spent to handle the backlog.

I still have a few pull requests pending for 2.6.35-rc (bug fixes) that I'll
be handling this week.

The patches marked as under review means that I'm expecting an action
from someone else (the patch author or the driver author/maintainer).

So, if you have patches there still under review, you're helping us 
if you direct your complains to the one that it is sitting on the top
of them.

Cheers,
Mauro.
