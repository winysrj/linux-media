How so ? With include/linux/idr.h ?

I haven't found any issue with it. I'm not sure why it would be incorrect to 
be honest. Am I missing something ?

Yes, my bad, I meant inode->i_cdev == NULL || 
!mdev_devnode_is_registered(mdev). If I moved the container_of outside of the 
locked section I would need to add an extra check inside, and I don't think 
the resulting locked section will get any smaller.

Tell me about it. I've spent lots of time on this issue in V4L2 a while ago. 
Fortunately refcount nightmares are getting less frequent ;-)

There are so few direct struct cdev users in the kernel that I'm beginning to 
wonder if this is the right way to go or if I'm just using cdev in a way it 
hasn't been designed to be used. My understanding was that I needed an 
instance of struct cdev per minor, but many subsystems seems to handle cdev 
differently. Is there any detailed documentation regarding how it should be 
used ?
