Hello again:

I have started to implemt it, but I think there is more hidden work in
this task as it seems. In order to call dma_map_sg and
max_dma_segment_size I need acess to the struct device, but (correct
me if I am wrong), vb2 is device agnostic. Adding the above
functionality will mean not only updating marvell-ccic and solo6x10,
but updating all the vb2 buffers.

Also after some readings, maybe the sg compactation should not be done
here, but in dma_map_sg. According to the doc:

"""
The implementation is free to merge several consecutive sglist entries
into one (e.g. if DMA mapping is done with PAGE_SIZE granularity, any
consecutive sglist entries can be merged into one provided the first one
ends and the second one starts on a page boundary - in fact this is a huge
advantage for cards which either cannot do scatter-gather or have very
limited number of scatter-gather entries) and returns the actual number
of sg entries it mapped them to. On failure 0 is returned.
"""

So, my proposal would be to alloc with alloc_pages to try to get
memory as coherent as possible, then split the page, set the sg in
PAGE_SIZE lenghts, and then let the dma_map_sg do its magic. if it
doesnt do compactation, fix dma_map_sg, so more driver could take
advantage of it.

I could also of course fix marvell-ccic and solo6x10 to use sg_table.

Does anything of this make sense?
