Huh, I thought I added media device support to cobalt. I probably started
that but never finished it. I can certainly take care of that one, it should
not be hard.

No. v4l2-ctl, v4l2-compliance and perhaps a future media-compliance. Those
are the primary use-cases.

But even more important it is against all my 'good API sense' that I can't
find the corresponding media device from a v4l-subdev/video device. If I
can get to them from the media device through major/minor numbers then
consistent API design requires that I can also go through the other
direction. Especially since I see no downside to this.

It's nuts that I can't just pass /dev/v4l-subdevX to v4l2-ctl/compliance
and have it find out everything about it automatically.

It's all about self-discovery in an API.

Sorry, I feel very strongly about this.
