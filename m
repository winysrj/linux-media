This only works if you don't have sub blocks or different functions to
describe. I suppose you could add yet another level of nodes. This
feels like abuse of the reg property even though to use the reg
property is a frequent review comment.

OTOH, we don't need 2 ways to describe this.

This example is not so complicated, but I already agreed on not using
regulators on the basis there are other properties of the driver
unique to LEDs.

Don't you mean <0 1> as the values are the "address" which in this
case are the LED driver output indexes.
