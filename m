Hi all.

This is question mail about ov772x driver.
I have 2 questiones.

1) 

I think ov772x driver was added to linux/kernel/git/mchehab/v4l-dvb.git in 2008-10-24.
but now , v4l-dvb.git doesn't have ov772x driver. 
I can find it in only linux/kernel/git/mchehab/linux-next.git

Therefore I tried to search information what this mchehab/linux-next.git is ?
sorry but I could not.
What is the purpose of mchehab/linux-next.git ?

Does ov772x driver will be merged to v4l-dvb when 2.6.29 is released ? or not ?

2)

I tried to send folloing 2 patches for ov772x driver

o 2008-11-12 "Change power on/off sequence on ov772x" v2
o 2008-11-18 "Add ov7725 ov7720 support to ov772x driver"

Does these patches are ignored ? or only slowly response ?
Should I send these again ?

Best regards
