The video and audio don't work at the same time because the video is
opened before the audio and it takes all the USB bandwidth.

The problem is in the main gspca.c, not in sonixj.c. It may fixed using
a lower alternate setting. To check it, you may add the following lines:

	if (dev->config->desc.bNumInterfaces != 1)
		gspca_dev->nbalt -= 1;
after
	gspca_dev->nbalt = intf->num_altsetting;
in the function gspca_dev_probe() of gspca.c.

If it still does not work, change "-= 1" to "-= 2" or "-= 3" (there are
8 alternate settings in your webcam).

For a correct fix, the exact video bandwidth shall be calculated and I
could not find yet time enough to do the job and people to test it...

Best regards.
