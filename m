Florian,

For all of these, what happens when the USB call times out and you kfree() the buffer?  Can the USB DMA actually complete after this kfree(), possibly corrupting space that has been reallocated off the heap, since the kfree()?

This is the scenario for which I assume allocating off the stack is bad.  

Do these changes simply make corruption less noticable since heap gets corrupted vs stack?

Regards,
Andy
