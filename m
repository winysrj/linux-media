Thanks for pointing it. It seems very interesting.

Paul, 

On a quick test, it seems that it doesn't recognize the tcpdump file 
format (at least, it was not able to capture the dump files I got 
with the beagleboard). Adding support for it could be an interesting 
addition to your code. 

Btw, it seems that most of your work is focused on getting VMware logs.
Most USB adapters I handle are USB 2.0 only, and have very high 
bandwidth requirements (something like 40%-60% of the total bandwidth
available at the USB bus). It would be nice to be capable of using a
VM on some cases, but the last time I tested VMWare, kvm, etc, none 
of them were capable of properly support USB 2.0 with isoc data transfers.

Do you know if any of them are now capable of properly emulate USB 2.0
isoc transfers and give enough performance for the devices to actually
work with such high-bandwidth requirements?

Yes, there are some similarities, although I think that the tools
complement each other.

Doing it via console is nice, as I can just use the serial interface of
the beagleboard to capture and parse data in real time.

An offline graphic analyser is interesting, especially when you need to
filter data and check event timings.

Yeah, that seems a good idea to me too.

Cheers,
Mauro
