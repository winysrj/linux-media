I don't rebase my tree, as this would cause troubles for everybody that
relies on it.

Reverting the entire patchset is hard, as there are lots of patches after
them, and some patches touch at V4L2 core. Even reverting those
two patches hit conflicts, that I needed to manage, in order to avoid
compilation breakages.

So, I really prefer to confine the patch reversion to the absolute 
minimum.
