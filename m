Subject: Is there a way to get linux-media daily digests?

Hi,
    Well, title says old... In previously linux-dvb list I was
subscribed to the daily digest modality of the list, so I was getting
only 2 or 3 digest messages per day. This is something I really miss
now, as I really prefer this way of subscribing to a mail list,
instead of just receiving every mail sent (I'm just scared thinking
what I will find in my mailbox when I come back from holidays...).

Is there a way to use such a modality for linux-media?

Best regards,
  Eduard

PS: if I've just missed something and the possibility exists but I'm
just too dumb to find it, please send me the link with a big RTFM in
it, I'll take no offense...
