Hello Andrew,

I think Pawel has replied to most of your comments, so I'll just add my own
0.02 KRW. ;)

I think that the biggest problem is fragmentation here.  For instance,
I think that a situation where there is enough free space but it's
fragmented so no single contiguous chunk can be allocated is a serious
problem.  However, I would argue that if there's simply no space left,
a multimedia device could fail and even though it's not desirable, it
would not be such a big issue in my eyes.

So, if only movable or discardable pages are allocated in CMA managed
regions all should work well.  When a device needs memory discardable
pages would get freed and movable moved unless there is no space left
on the device in which case allocation would fail.

Critical devices (just a hypothetical entities) could have separate
regions on which only discardable pages can be allocated so that memory
can always be allocated for them.

As Pawel said, I think Zach's trying to solve a different problem.  No
matter, as I've said in response to Konrad's message, I have thought
about unifying Zach's IOMMU and CMA in such a way that devices could
work on both systems with and without IOMMU if only they would limit
the usage of the API to some subset which always works.

Not a problem.
