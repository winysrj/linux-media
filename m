Dave should chime in here since currently dma-buf is _GPL and the
drm_prime.c wrapper for it is not (and he merged that one, contributed
from said $vendor). And since we're gfx people everything we do is MIT
licensed (that's where X is from after all), so _GPL for for drm stuff
really doesn't make a lot of sense for us. ianal and all that applies.
