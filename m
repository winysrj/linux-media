Are you serious? Lower networking layers should be transparent to the
upper layers. You don't implement VPN or say TCP in all of your
applications, do you? These are just some more made-up arguments which
don't have anything to do with the use cases I explained earlier.

(*) DVB isn't local either. It's using broadcast media after all. It's
designed to cope with packet loss and includes relative decoding and
presentation time stamps in its media payloads. Although DVB specifies
some minimal repetition rates for repeatedly sent data, real life
applications need to handle much lower repetition rates anyway (i.e.
higher timeouts), in order to cope with individual settings of
broadcasters trying to save some bandwidth in their multiplexes. Real
life applications also need to handle high timeouts due to possible
packet loss, especially in satellite and terrestrial networks.

However, the TS transport between the client and server components may
very well use one of the protocols you're referring to, yes.

Again, are you serious? Virtually all users I expect will use their
local network and you're using a satellite link as an example to explain
why you think it's going to suck for everybody? I don't know anybody
who's voluntarily using a satellite link for his internet connection.
Roundtrip time in my LAN is about 0.25 ms, which is 1/1920th of your
"typical" example.

I also don't understand how your 10 GB (sic!) of bandwidth come into
play, if only few MBit/s are required to transfer a DVB video service
(or few KBit/s for audio or data). You're suggesting high bandwidth
usage to uninformed readers, where maybe only few bytes are to be
transferred.

You're suggesting that this project is still a theory, but it's already
there and it's already in use by many people, who are happy with it. So
latency can't be such a big problem as you're trying to point out.

Regarding increased latency for ioctls: The Linux DVB API doesn't
specifiy any time frames within which ioctls must return. Most ioctls
are known to block, the few others handle non-blocking mode. Adding some
ms delay for the network transfer really is no problem at all.

Regarding the asynchronous nature of networking: USB transfers are
asynchronous too, but USB tuners work well using in-kernel drivers. The
usbip even combines both asynchronous worlds. Oh wait, usbip already
resides in staging. How come?

What you didn't take into account: Whatever you'll try to do
interactively over a satellite link (or even over most 3G connections),
it sucks. Florian's solution won't be an exemption, no matter how it's
implemented.

Have you ever tried SSH over a satellite link? It sucks. Does SSH suck
because of that? Rather not.

There's no difference between network errors in this case and USB
errors/disconnects in the case of USB tuners.

Unfortunately, you still wouldn't have solved the issue vtunerc is
trying to solve, if you built such a library and included it in szap et al.
