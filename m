Resources should not be allocated by the driver until needed (i.e. the
queue_setup op is a good place for that).

It is perfectly legal to open a video node just to call QUERYCAP to
see what it is, and I don't expect that to allocate any hardware resources.
And if I want to open it 100 times, then that should just work.

It is *always* wrong to limit the number of open arbitrarily.
