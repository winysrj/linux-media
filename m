You're probably right, but it makes waiting a lot easier if I don't have to deal with memory allocations. :P

Reading the seqlock code makes me suspect that's the case too. The lockdep code calls
local_irq_disable, so it's probably safe without preemption disabled.

~Maarten

I like the ability of not allocating memory, so I kept reservation_object_wait_timeout_rcu mostly
the way it was. This code appears to fail on nouveau when using the shared members,
but I'm not completely sure whether the error is in nouveau or this code yet.

[RFC v2] reservation: add suppport for read-only access using rcu

This adds 4 more functions to deal with rcu.

reservation_object_get_fences_rcu() will obtain the list of shared
and exclusive fences without obtaining the ww_mutex.

reservation_object_wait_timeout_rcu() will wait on all fences of the
reservation_object, without obtaining the ww_mutex.

reservation_object_test_signaled_rcu() will test if all fences of the
reservation_object are signaled without using the ww_mutex.

reservation_object_get_excl() is added because touching the fence_excl
member directly will trigger a sparse warning.
