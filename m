I've broken the diagram into pieces as it won't fit in 80 columns. Ports named 
by a capital letter enclosed in parentheses are connected together. 

Let's start with the on-board input paths, with an HDMI input connector and a 
camera sensor.

 ,-----------.      ,----------.
 | HDMI      |      | ADV7611  |
 | Connector | ---> | HDMI     | ---> (A)
 |           |      | Decoder  |
 `-----------'      `----------'

 ,-----------.
 | AR0331    |
 | Camera    | ---> (B)
 | Sensor    |
 `-----------'

We then get to the SoC.

      |
      |    ,-----------.      ,------------.
      |    | BT.656    |      | Test       |
(A) -[0]-> | Decoder   | ---> | Pattern    | ---> (C)
      |    |           |      | Generator  |
      |    `-----------'      `------------'
      |
      |    ,-----------.      ,------------.      ,------------.
      |    | CSI-2     |      |            |      | Test       |
(B) -[1]-> | Receiver  | ---> | Processing | ---> | Pattern    |  ---> (D)
      |    |           |  `   |            |      | Generator  |
      |    `-----------'  |   `------------'      `------------'
      |                   |   ,------------.
      |                   |   |            |      ,-----.
      | --SOC--           `-> | Statistics | ---> | DMA |
      |                       |            |      `-----'
      |                       `------------'

The blocks named Processing is made of

      ,------------.      ,------------.      ,-------------.
      | Faulty     |      | Bayer      |      | White       |
 ---> | Pixels     | ---> | to RGB     | ---> | Balance     | ---.
      | Correction |      | Conversion |      | Correction  |    |
      `------------'      `------------'      `-------------'    |
                                                                 |
 ,---------------------------------------------------------------'
 |
 |    ,------------.      ,------------.      ,-------------.
 |    | Gamma      |      | RGB to YUV |      | Image       |
 `--> | Correction | ---> | Conversion | ---> | Enhancement | --->
      |            |      |            |      |             |
      `------------'      `------------'      `-------------'

The two flows then go through a crossbar switch.

                                ,--------.
                                |        |      ,-----.
           ,-----------.     -> | Scaler | ---> | DMA |
           |           |   ,'   |        |      `-----'
           |     ,----[2] -     `--------'
 (C) ---> [0]---'      |
           |   `,-----[3] ----> (E)
 (D) ---> [1]--'       |
           |    `-----[4] -
           |           |   `--> (F)
           `-----------'

One of the video streams went to memory through DMA. The second one enters the 
compositor through a scaler, with two additional streams coming from memory.

                  ,------------.       ,--------------.
     ,-----.      | RGB to YUV |       |              |
     | DMA | ---> | Conversion | ---> [0]             |
     `-----'      |            |       |              |
                  `------------'       |              |
                  ,--------.           |              |
     ,-----.      |        |           |  Compositor  |
     | DMA | ---> | Scaler | -------> [1]            [3] ---> (G)
     `-----'      |        |           |              |
                  `--------'           |              |
                  ,--------.           |              |
                  |        |           |              |
     (E) -------> | Scaler | -------> [2]             |
                  |        |           |              |
                  `--------'           `--------------'

The remaining video capture stream and the video display stream exit the SoC 
and are output to HDMI connectors through HDMI encoders.

          |
          |    ,---------.      ,-----------.
          |    | ADV7511 |      | HDMI      |
    (G) -[2]-> | HDMI    | ---> | Output    |
          |    | Encoder |      | Connector |
          |    `---------'      `-----------'
          |
          |    ,---------.      ,-----------.
          |    | ADV7511 |      | HDMI      |
    (F) -[3]-> | HDMI    | ---> | Output    |
          |    | Encoder |      | Connector |
  --SOC-- |    `---------'      `-----------'
          |

Every block in this diagram (including the DMA engines) corresponds to a 
device instance and has a device node in the device tree.

Note how the same RGB to YUV conversion and scaler blocks are used in both 
capture and display pipelines, how the capture and display pipelines are 
merged at the hardware level, and how the same HDMI encoder is used for one 
video output that comes from the display device (G) and one video output that 
comes straight from the capture device (F).

I wish this was an example I made up instead of real hardware I need to 
support.
