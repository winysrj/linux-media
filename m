I'll recheck with my shiny new Fedora 15 install maybe later tonight.

The only thing that springs to mind that PA may not like is no mixer controls.  Some basic code is there in cx18-alsa-mixer.c, but never registered.

Pactl does have some magic cmd to let go of the nodes, but I can never remember it.
