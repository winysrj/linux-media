yeah, the intention was to use short timeout or no-blocking if from
atomic ctxt, or interruptible with whatever timeout if non-atomic (for
example, to implement a CPU_PREP sort of ioctl)

probably a hint, ie. add a flags parameter to attach() would do the job?

I was just using EINVAL, but perhaps there is a better choice?

yeah, it was the intention that signal() could be from irq handler
directly (and that registered cb's can be called from atomic ctxt..
which is sufficient if they just have to bang a register or two,
otherwise they can schedule a worker)

oh, whoops, I started w/ spin_lock() an then realized I wanted
signal() from irq handlers and forgot to update all the other places
where spin_lock() was used
