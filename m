I could guess these errors are coming because you query statistics but 
device is sleeping and statistics cannot be offered. -EAGAIN == device 
is sleeping, -ENOTTY device does not support given statistic at all.

Could you ensure that? Use some app, like w_scan, tzap, czap, etc. to 
tune and recheck if it shows these or not. femon could not tune, it 
queries only statistics. You will need to leave tuning on and then use 
other terminal for femon.

hmm, that dvbscan results sounds crazy. I am not sure about these 
scanning apps as there is scan, dvbscan, scandvb. Maybe some of those, 
or even all, are just same app but renamed as "scan" is too general. My 
Fedora 17 has scandvb. I just tested against one DRX-K device and it 
worked fine.

Try to downgrade Kernels until you find working one.
