You appear to have different information. Their site and mail
announcements don't mention any H.264 decoder, nor HDMI out. Even the
photo says otherwise. This is the one I mean:
http://www.netup.tv/en-EN/dual_dvb-s2-ci_card.php

If what you say was true, (I wish it would), if it weren't a "budget"
card, I wouldn't call it a rip-off -- it would be a pretty neat piece of
HW. Still a bit pricey, but within limits. Unfortunately, from what I've
gathered from the site, announcements and mails with the manufacturer,
it is just a dual budget card. If so, it is a rip-off. :)
