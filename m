To those guy who cares Rockchip

There is a update about Rockchip media framework, I decided not to 
continue of developing the VA-API driver for produces purpose(both 
official and private plan). As there is really to much problem with 
VA-API with V4L2. But I may develop the VA-API driver to know how to 
expend the parser in Gstreamer.
The currently Gstreamer plugins using a rockchip video parser and HAL 
layer library could be located here
https://github.com/rockchip-linux/gstreamer-rockchip

For the future develop plan, I would try to move all the thing to 
Gstreamer V4L2 plugin, maybe I would create a new plugin. But it would 
be a long time to go. As there is no critical need of the Media 
framework for Rockchip in Linux, the official plan would be paused, if 
the kodi or LibreELEC is not interesting to my supervisor, this plan 
will become my private plan, but good news is that my plan about the ISP 
support would become official.

Any the result would be there is a standard V4L2 API and a driver for 
those stateless video driver(Do remember we don't need firmware). And I 
would use the Gstreamer in userspace and welcome the other to offer the 
support in the other project.

For the those project who have supported the ffmpeg, I would suggest you 
to add support for Gstreamer, the role of Gstreamer in a player is not 
different to the ffmpeg. The support of ffmpeg of Rockchip project would 
be dropped, as we need a power way to rendering decoding result for 
those 4K video. The Gstreamer is the only Media Framework who could 
offer a static interface and easy to extend. Even the Gstreamer, 
currently I found it could only cover the 80% solution of I would meet,
but it is enough for Linux.
