I'll give you another solution to the problem - lobby ARM Ltd to have
this restriction lifted from the architecture specification, which
will probably result in the speculative prefetching also having to be
removed.

That would be my preferred solution if I had the power to do so, but
I have to live with what ARM Ltd (and their partners such as yourselves)
decide should end up in the architecture specification.
