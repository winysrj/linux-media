Just to clarify: struct video_device gets a *pointer* to a mutex. The mutex
itself can be either at the top-level device or associated with the actual
video device, depending on the requirements of the driver.

vb_lock is AFAIK there to protect the streaming of data. And that's definitely
per device node since only one filehandle per device node can do streaming.

Also remember that we are trying to get rid of the BKL, so staying bug-compatible
is enough for a first version :-)
