Well, for sure you don't need to touch at s_fmt, as it calls try_fmt. Also,
if the problem is that the scaler requrires that the vertical resolution to be
multiple of some limit, a patch like the one bellow would do a better job:

Some scalers require an even vertical resolution. So, you'll need to adjust the
above, according with the restrictions you may have on the scaler your webcam
has.

Btw, V4L2 core defines a macro for such type of adjustments. For example,
em28xx uses it as:

		/* width must even because of the YUYV format
		   height must be even because of interlacing */
		v4l_bound_align_image(&width, 48, maxw, 1, &height, 32, maxh,
				      1, 0);

(

So, a better fix would be to remove the RESTRICT_TO_RANGE() calls, and use
the v4l_bound_align_image() macro instead, filled with the needed restrictions,
like:
	v4l_bound_align_image(&width, MIN_FRAME_WIDTH, MAX_FRAME_WIDTH, 1,
			      &height, MIN_FRAME_HEIGHT, MAX_FRAME_HEIGHT, 0);

[usbvision] Fix width/height scaling limits

It assumes that both just width is required to be even number.

NOT TESTED.
