I think its fine that the driver doesn't implement something described in
DT - we are describing the hardware not the implementation. But I think its
not fine that DT includes properties not described in the binding.

So I think we should either
a) Fix the binding documentation, but perhaps it is already correct
   in which case we should;
b) Apply this patch

Once we have decided what is the correct description of the hardware we
can consider implications on the driver implementation.
