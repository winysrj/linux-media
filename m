Subject: Is anyone working on a Dual DVB-S2 PCIe Tuner driver?

I've had a look at the Wiki and there appears to be only two PCIe
cards that have Dual Tuners.

However both seem crazily expensive and perhaps in once case are vapourware.

Is there anyone working on any DVB-S2 PCI Express Device that has dual tuners?

Lastly (I know it's not shipping yet) there's a newly announced
Blackgold card BGT3595
that supposedly will have Dual DVB-T AND Dual DVB-S2 (so 4 tuners) on
a PCI express platform.
Will anyone be working on a driver for that device?  (Looking back
through the lists it would appear)
that previous cards from Blackgold couldn't get the information to
produce a driver.

Thanks in advance.
