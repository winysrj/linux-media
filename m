Yes, CCID and serial are different interfaces. CCID is new interface 
specified by USB organization that needs "hardware" level interface 
profile like mass storage profile. Serial is block device interface 
(/dev/tty).

Since Anysee device itself does not have CCID interface it is needed to 
make virtual USB device in order to get CCID support. I have never seen 
virtual USB devices like that, but there is VHCI in current kernel 
staging that actually does something like that over IP.
