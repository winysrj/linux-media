Thank you for the feedback. I already did that. See latest tree:
http://git.linuxtv.org/anttip/media_tree.git/shortlog/refs/heads/anysee

Adding IOCTLs and making new userspace IFD was Istv√°n idea / propose.

Interface is now de facto standard Phoenix. Unfortunately it is not very 
compatible yet. I used oscam as client during development mainly since 
as a open source it was easy to look and add debugs to see what kind of 
protocol is. Unfortunately I did mistake and removed accidentally my 
original tree and was forced to rewrite it. At that point oscam stopped 
working, but it is surely small bug. I suspect .set_termios() or 
.tiocmget() or .tiocmset().

Currently device name and location are under the discussion. Mainly, 
should that device be under /dev/tty* as other character devices or 
under /dev/dvb/adapterN/ as a property of DVB card.

regards
Antti
