I think it is important that one cache line is not shared between
a DMA buffer and other objects, especially on architectures where
cache coherency is managed in software (ARM, MIPS etc.).  If you
use kmalloc() for the DMA buffer that is guaranteed.
(E.g. DMA API will do writeback/invalidate before the DMA starts, but
if the CPU accesses a variable which is next to the buffer
while DMA is still pending then the whole cacheline is read back into
the cache.  If the CPU is then trying to read the DMA buffer after
the DMA finished it will see stale data from the cache.  You lose.)

It depends on the device doing DMA if it needs special alignment.
If you meet its alignment requirements, and wait for the end of the DMA before
returning, and make sure the buffer does not share cache lines with
neighbouring objects on the stack, then you can use DMA buffers on
stack.  In practice it's simpler and much less error prone to use kmalloc().

Regarding usb_control_msg(), since it is a synchronous API which
waits for the end of the transfer I'm relatively sure there is no
DMA pending when it returns, even if it aborts with timeout or any
other error code.
