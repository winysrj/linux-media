For handling fragmentation, there is the option of ZONE_MOVABLE so it's
usable by normal allocations but the CMA can take action to get it
cleared out if necessary. Another option that is trickier but less
disruptive would be to select a range of memory in a normal zone for CMA
and mark it MIGRATE_MOVABLE so that movable pages are allocated from it.
The trickier part is you need to make that bit stick so that non-movable
pages are never allocated from that range. That would be trickish to
implement but possible and it would avoid the fragmentation
problem without pinning memory.
