Hi,

the merge of the content from the old V4L Wiki into
the V4L-DVB Wiki has been nearly completed, but seems
to have come to a halt?  I would like to kill off the
old V4L Wiki soon.  IMHO most of the remaining pages
are old user discussions, maybe it's best
if the users themselves take care of copying it over
to the V4L-DVB Wiki if they think their content is
still relevant.

My plan is to delete the old Wiki soon after Sep. 1.

New account creation in the V4L Wiki has been disabled.
