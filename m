Hmm, I can't reproduce this anymore. We did observe it but I can't
remember with which hardware or graphics driver version.

Testing with a Windows 10 Intel laptop with recent drivers just showed
either an empty vendor InfoFrame with a 1080p EDID or a vendor InfoFrame
that sets the HDMI VIC to 1 for a 4kp30 EDID.

The length is 5 in both cases.

Testing with a different laptop gave a vendor InfoFrame with HDMI VIC 1 and
a length of 6.
