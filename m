Hi Pascal,

I've written a very small program that does just that :
https://svn.tuxicoman.be/listing.php?repname=dvbsplit
It's a quick hack, there is probably a better way to do this but at
least it works :)

To get the sources : "svn checkout
https://svn.tuxicoman.be/svn/dvbsplit/trunk dvbsplit". Check the readme
for compilation.

You'll need to tune to the right TP with `{stc}zap -r`, then start it
and it will dump everything in the directory.

HTH,
  Guy
