Greetings Dear,

How are you? i hope all is well with you, i hope you may not know me, and i
don't know who you are, My Name is Sonia i am just browsing now i just saw your email today and it seams like some thing touches me all over my body,

i started having some feelings in me which i have never experience in me before, so i became interested in you, l will also like to know you the more,and l want you to send an email. so l can give you my picture for you to know whom l am.
 
I believe we can move from here!
I am waiting for your mail to my email address above. jama_sonia21@yahoo.com
 
(Remember the distance or colour does not matter any relationship as long as there is faith in it and life two)
Miss Sonia
