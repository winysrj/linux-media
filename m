I don't think that's right. That's just like passing clock names in
platform data, which I believe is frowned upon.

Instead, why not take the approach that e.g. regulators have taken? Each
driver defines the names of the objects that it requires. There is a
table (registered by a board file) that has lookup key (device name,
regulator name), and the output is the regulator device (or global
regulator name).

This is almost the same way that DT works, except that in DT, the table
is represented as properties in the DT. The DT binding defines the names
of those properties, or the strings that must be in the foo-names
properties, just like a driver in non-DT Linux is going to define the
names it expects to be provided with.

That way, you don't need platform data to define the names.
