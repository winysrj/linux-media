Stop this idiocy.

The kernel doesn't have a lockup problem. udev does.

As even  you admit, it is *udev* that has the whole serialization
issue, and does excessive (and incorrect) serialization between
events. Resulting in the kernel timing out a udev event that takes too
long.

The fact that you then continually try to make this a "kernel issue"
is just disgusting. Talking about the kernel solving it "properly" is
pretty dishonest, when the kernel wasn't the problem in the first
place. The kernel not only does things right, but this all used to
work fine.
