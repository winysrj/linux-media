Well, it certainly makes sense to have a single implementation for this.
But I want to hide this complexity to the user of the IOMMU-API. The
best choice is to put this into the layer between the IOMMU-API and the
backend implementation.

That interface is not put into stone. There were other complains about
the ->unmap part recently, so there is certainly room for improvement
there.
