Hello,

My name is Alex Tucker and I am the engineering manager here at
ViewCast.  We have released two new Osprey cards based on the Conexant
CX23888 chipset - which is similar to the CX25878/BT878A chipset that
has some support in the Open Source community.  We are interested in
having Linux driver support for the new cards. 

I found the  www.linuxdriverproject.org website where the process for
having Linux  drivers created (at
http://www.linuxdriverproject.org/foswiki/bin/view/Main/CompanyProcess )
can be found.   

We can provide some specifications, the card hardware itself, and some
support for this endeavor.    Please contact me directly if interested.

Thanks very much!
Alex Tucker
