Remove the CONFIG_ prefix from two Kconfig symbols in a dependency for
SMS_SIANO_DEBUGFS. This prefix is invalid inside Kconfig files.

Note that the current (common sense) dependency on SMS_USB_DRV and
SMS_SDIO_DRV being equal ensures that SMS_SIANO_DEBUGFS will not
violate its constraints. These constraint are that:
- it should only be built if SMS_USB_DRV is set;
- it can't be builtin if USB support is modular.

So drop the dependency on SMS_USB_DRV, as it is unneeded.

This is not runtime tested, as I don't have the hardware.

A matrix of the three cases in which this symbol can be set, to aid
review and to see whether I actually understood the constraints:

USB  SMS_USB_DRV  SMS_SDIO_DRV  SMS_SIANO_MDTV  SMS_SIANO_DEBUGFS
m    m            m             m               y 
y    m            m             m               y 
y    y            y             y               y 

By the way, I found myself staring at the entries in this file for quite
some time. Perhaps things would have been easier to understand if
SMS_USB_DRV and SMS_SDIO_DRV both selected SMS_SIANO_MDTV. But I didn't
dare to test that idea.
