It is important to notice that the vendor (Trident) doesn't seem to want
helping with open source development. Contacts with the vendor were tried
during 2007 and 2008 in order to get their help by opening docs, via Linux
Foundation NDA program, without success.

The vendor also seems to be refusing so far to help the development of a
driver for their demod DRX-K line that they acquired from Micronas (as
pointed at http://linux.terratec.de/tv_en.html).
