I do not understand where you find this. Table 44-12: 
IPP_IND_SENSB_DATA[15:1] - 15 bits, most importantly 
CSI_SENS_CONF[DATA_WIDTH]

00	2 x 4-bit
01	8 bit
10	10 bit
11	15 bit

I don't see any possibility to get all 16 bits.

Again, look in the datasheet, CSI_SENS_FRM_SIZE[SENS_FRM_WIDTH] is a 
12-bit wide field and codes width - 1, i.e., maximum frame width is 2^12 = 
4096.

Try starting with smaller frames, maybe just VGA, then try bigger ones.
