Nice. Are your solution open-sourced? If so, can you give me URL?

Yes, that can be the issue, I understand that.

You know - I'm a bit confused. Somebody are pointing on double
data copying (userspace networked daemon -> kernel -> application)
issue and another one warn me to not start network connection
from the kernel. But if it works for NFS or CIFS then it should not
be so weaky, isn't it?

I'm really tired from all those "hack, crap, pigback ..." wordings.

What exactly vtuner aproach does so hackish (other then exposing
DVB internals, what is every time made if virtualization support is developing)?

The code itself no need to patch any line of vanilla kernel source, it even
doesn't change any processing of the rest of kernel, it is very simple
driver/code/whatever.

I can understand that some developers don't like to get dvb-core opened,
I don't agree with them, but I don't really need to fight with them.
Its theirs opinion.
But even I try to see what is so hackish in vtuner implementation, I don't catch
anything. Simplicity? I thought that simplicity is a big advanatge (simple code,
easy to analyze). What else?
