Subject: [PATCH/RFC 1/2] v4l: Repurpose the v4l2_plane data_offset field
Date: Tue, 14 Apr 2015 22:44:48 +0300

The data_offset field has been introduced along with the multiplane API
to convey header size information between kernelspace and userspace.
It's not used by any mainline driver except vivid (for testing purpose).

A different data offset is needed to allow data capture to or data
output from a userspace-selected offset within a buffer (mainly for the
DMABUF and MMAP memory types). As the data_offset field already has the
right name and is unused, repurpose it.
