I think the macros are fine.

I think the macro naming is not great.

Maybe add DEFINE_/DECLARE_/_INIT or something other than an action
name type to the macro names.

I think the consistency is better if all the references are done
as arrays, even for single entry arrays.

It's all quibbling in any case.
