Maybe my comment is not clear enough, but the below suspend_capture() doesn't 
indicate any failure on a frame just captured. It only prevents the frame 
from being overwritten by the already autoreinitialized DMA engine, pointing 
back to the same buffer once again.

> Besides, you seem to also be

pcdev->ready == NULL means no buffer was available when it was time to put it 
into the DMA programming register set. As a result, a next DMA transfer has 
just been autoreinitialized with the same buffer parameters as before. To 
protect the buffer from being overwriten unintentionally, we have to stop the 
DMA transfer as soon as possible, hopefully before the sensor starts sending 
out next frame data.

If a new buffer has been queued meanwhile, best we can do is stopping 
everything, programming the DMA with the new buffer, and setting up for a new 
transfer hardware auto startup on nearest frame start, be it the next one if 
we are lucky enough, or one after the next if we are too slow.

I hope the above explanation clarifies why.

I'll try to rework the above comment to be more clear, OK? Any hints?

Looks like there is also some space for improvement in my documentation here.

In short, until the DMA ISR is called with the buf->sgbuf reset back to NULL, 
which should happen while the previous DMA ISR's called try_next_sgbuf() has 
retuned NULL, the frame is still not ready, ie. still being filled with DMA. 
IOW, only the DMA interrupt with buf->sgbuf == NULL means that the last sgbuf 
DMA transfer has just been completed.

Meanwhile, a next sglist could already be put in advanvce into the DMA 
programming register set and just activated (copied to the DMA working 
register set) automatically.

Sorry, I forgot to answer your previously asked question about the MCLK_EN 
(master clock enable) requirement if not rising the CAMEXCLK_EN (sensor clock 
enable).

The documentation (http://focus.ti.com/lit/ug/spru684/spru684.pdf) says:

	"the MCLK_EN bit must first be set before any camera-interface registers 
	 access"

so the answer is yes, the MCLK is required not only for providing a sensor 
with a clock, but also for the host interface itself to do its job.

The default case above (no CAMEXCLK_EN) is intended to be used on a board 
whith a sensor that is driven from a clock source other than the interface's 
CAM_EXCLK pin, which is keept idle in this case. Am I missing something?

My general assumption was to provide support for all interface hardware 
features which are supported by the existing soc_camera framework, not only 
those required by my board or sensor. Could it be that this approach breaks a 
general rule of not putting any code that is not (yet) used by any consumer?

Maybe my understanding of what is actually going on here is not enough. TBH, 
I've just copy-pasted this piece of code from mx1_camera.c in order to 
provide support for a hardware feature that is available on my platform, 
regardles of any boards actually using it or not. Almost all existing 
soc_camera host drivers, ie. the pxa_camera.c and all of mx?_camera.c, follow 
the same or very similiar pattern, and the only exception, 
sh_mobile_ceu_camera.c, looks for me like just missing this hardware feature. 
Then, having no example implementation to follow and not ehough understanding 
of the matter, I'm not sure if I'm able to make you happy. Please give me 
more details if you think this is important.

I moved them both over to the header file because I was using the 
OMAP1_CAMERA_MIN_BUF_COUNT(CONTIG) macro once from the platform code in order 
to calculate the buffer size when calling the then NAKed 
dma_preallocate_coherent_memory(). Now I could put them back into the driver 
code, but if we ever get back to the concept of preallocating a contignuos 
piece of memory from the platform init code, we might need them back here, so 
maybe I should rather keep them, only rename the two enum values using a 
distinct name space. What do you think is better for now?

Thanks,
Janusz
