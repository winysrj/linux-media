What's the status of the ISI driver porting? Any progress? Or any plans 
idea when you will be able to work on it? If you have no plans to do the 
porting in the near future, maybe you could send me your latest patch, so, 
I could have a look at it and _maybe_ see, if I find time to convert it 
myself (no promise though)?

Thanks
