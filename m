So I have no problem with that. What I did have problems with was the
net/socket.c kind of workarounds (which I noticed mainly because they
had that whole EINVAL confusion built into them). Those were why I
decided that the warning has to go.

But if you can re-introduce the warning without workarounds like
those, I have no problem with us reintroducing the warning, even if it
is technically not really kosher and will afaik still print that
warning for the case of a compat-ioctl transform that *would* have
been valid, just not for that particular file descriptor.

But the printout is small and not all that annoying, and explicitly
limited in number, so I guess I don't mind a few false positives if it
really can help find stale translation entries.
