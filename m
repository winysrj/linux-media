What I said on that time is that  a virtual driver to run at the OS on a
VM machine (kvm or xen) that would export the DVB devices that are available
at the OS at the local host or on a remote host running the spice client
could be an interesting contribution, and would fit into kernelspace.

I'm not sure about such need nowadays, as very recent patches added on kvm
are now allowing to use USB 2.0 video devices on it (I tested and used it
a few days ago - it seems to be working at least with the devices I tested),
and PCI passthrough is already there also. Yet, a DVB-optimized passthrough
module there would likely perform better than just exporting the physical
device to the VM.

The driver, as proposed, is not really a driver, as it doesn't support any
hardware. The kernel driver would be used to just copy data from one userspace
application to the other. The same result could be obtained in userspace,
by implementing a library. Such library could even use LD_PRELOAD to support
binary only applications, like what libv4l does. In terms of performance,
such library would probably perform better than a kernel driver, as there's
no need to do context switching for each call, and no need to talk with a
device (where kernel outperforms userspace). Also, depending on how such library
is implemented, double buffering might be avoided.

So, from architectural POV, this code should be written as an userspace library.
BTW, alsa also came with the same results, years ago, as audio remote
streaming is supported via userspace tools, like pulseaudio.
