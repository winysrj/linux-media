Can I get as much disassembly of the PAC7302 drivers with your comments next to it? I am trying to improve my webcam and currently disassembling the driver, in Vista64 with IDA Pro. (I still have the 32 bit driver files as I upgraded from xp32)
I am helping on the gAIM/Pidgin voice/video chat and this driver isn't where I  would like it to be. I need better color balance, even after changing alot of options I still turn out orange quite a bit.
I have Assembly expierence, I own the Intel Instruction Manuals, so figuring out the actual given driver with a little bit of help based on the current progress should not be difficult
