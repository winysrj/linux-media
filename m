So setting CAPTURE potentially also changes OUTPUT format?

If the encoded stream supports colorimetry information, should that
information be taken from the CAPTURE queue?

Isn't this optional? If S_FMT(CAP) already sets OUTPUT to a valid
format, just G_FMT(OUT) should be valid here as well.

These are specific to multiplanar drivers. The same should apply to
singleplanar drivers.

Actual encoding starts once both queues are streaming and stops as soon
as the first queue receives STREAMOFF?

Does this mean that hardware that doesn't support changing parameters at
runtime at all must stop streaming and restart streaming internally with
every parameter change? Or is it acceptable to not allow the controls to
be changed during streaming?

Should TRY_FMT on the OUTPUT queue only return formats that can be
transformed into the currently set format on the capture queue?
(That is, after setting colorimetry on the CAPTURE queue, will
TRY_FMT(OUT) always return that colorimetry?)

Same as for decoding, is this limited to pixel format? Why isn't the
pixel format corrected to a supported choice? What about
width/height/colorimetry?
