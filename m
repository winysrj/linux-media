I don't have a full set of regulators described, that's why things broke when
I tried the regulator_full_constraints call earlier. But I don't think it would be too
big issue to check the current after boot configuration and define all the
regulators as you suggest. I will try this approach.

OK, this is not a viable solution.

Thanks for the comments,
