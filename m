If you're setting aside a pool of pages, then you have to dynamically
size it.  I did mention during our discussion about this.

The problem is that a pool of fixed size is two fold: you need it to be
sufficiently large that it can satisfy all allocations which come along
in atomic context.  Yet, we don't want the pool to be too large because
then it prevents the memory being used for other purposes.

Basically, the total number of pages in the pool can be a fixed size,
but as they are depleted through allocation, they need to be
re-populated from CMA to re-build the reserve for future atomic
allocations.  If the pool becomes larger via frees, then obviously
we need to give pages back.
