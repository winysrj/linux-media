OK. Looking forward to V2.

Can you include his words of wisdom in the git description?

The issue I had was with '/**' but let me double-check where I learned
that /** was a bad. Either way, it is a style-guide thing and the
Documentation/* trumps what I recall.

Or just private contents of the backend driver. But the naming is not that important
to inhibit this patch from being merged.

It is more of just making the readability easier. As in reading from top bottom
one. But if it is too ugly, don't bother.

OK. Might want to mention the user to look in the Documentation, in case you don't
already have it.

Ok. What about just adding that in as a nop function operation. And have an
initial implementation in the code base that does .. well, nothing except 
return -ENOSPC and move the TODO to the code instead of it being in the header?
