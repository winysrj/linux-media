My testing shows that:

 1. If I remove uvcvideo BEFORE suspend and reinsert it after resume,
    it works.  However, I cannot always rmmod uvcvideo before suspend
    as it may be in use.

 2. As a work around, removing ehci_hcd and reinserting ehci_hcd upon
    resume works as well.

 3. Since my distribution's kernels come with ehci_hcd built into the
    kernel, and I cannot do #2 any more, I also found that unbinding
    and rebinding the device (with the script I sent earlier on) works
    as well.

I think uvcvideo is failing to reinitialize the camera on resume, and
forcing an uvcvideo "reset" with either of these three methods kicks
uvcvideo into working again.

Phil.
