Hello,

I have Mandriva 2010.2 up to date and I try to install a Leadtek
Winfast Dongle H.
I couldn't make it run with the Mandriva provided v4l modules and
drivers, so I have built v4l from the scratch. The build process
performed wonderfully, but I could not find any channel.
The same dongle works perfectly on a Windows 7, so the signal is not
the problem.

I need help to diagnose further or a hint if someone know what is
special about this card.

Thanks,
Mike
