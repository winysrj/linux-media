I think you could do the same thing, the proposed page allocator
solutions still needs to manage pageblock state, you can manage those
the same as you would your cma regions -- the difference is that you get
the option of letting the rest of the system use the memory in a
transparent manner if you don't need it.

Right, dunno really, rather depends on the memory bandwidth of your arm
device I suspect. It is something you'd have to test. 

In case the machine isn't fast enough, there really isn't anything you
can do but keep the memory empty at all times; unless of course the
device in question needs it.
