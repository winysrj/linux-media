No, I recommended the HVR1900 because *IT* is fully supported, and is
*not* getting replaced.  HVR900 got replaced.  HVR1900 is not as large
as a set top box, but it is bigger than the usb sticks, and uses a
power brick, for the mpeg encoder.

It is on the Hauppauge web site, you probably just overlooked it.
