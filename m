Hello,

I have been redirected here after subscribing to the "linux-dvb" list.
Thus, I asked my usage-related question on this mailing list, but I did
not get any reply up to now (subject "Very poor quality on buget card
TwinHan VP DST"). 

I suspect that this is because this mailing list is not a user mailing
list, but developers-only. If this is the case, could someone please
point me in the right direction for discussing user issues like mine?

Thank you very much,
Arne Brutschy
