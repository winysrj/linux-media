Yeah, my proposal is to add V4L2 interface into ledtrig-camera.c. For
existing chip driver like yours LM3555, I guess we don't need to big
change but for future support for new chip or adding flash/torch to
existing chip, we need to create or change chip driver. Because
eventually those flash/torch/indicator operation happens in chip
driver.
