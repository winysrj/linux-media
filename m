Yeah I can remove these. I am not using them in this series.

I didn't have this at first. I was testing with tvtime and
noticed the count going up to 40k+ while it is streaming.
The count kept going up. So I figured I might as well add
the check to cover for cases where application like tvtime
run for a very longtime like a couple of hours.
