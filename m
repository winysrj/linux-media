I think that we also used same concept as your. for this, you can
refer to Dave's repository below and see the drm_prime_gem_destroy
function.
http://cgit.freedesktop.org/~airlied/linux/commit/?h=drm-prime-dmabuf&id=7cb374d6642e838e0e4836042e057e6d9139dcad

but when it comes to releasing resources, I mistakely understood some
parts of dmabuf concept so thank you for Rob and Sumit. that is very
useful.
