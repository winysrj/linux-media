Yes, I found it. It was rather new patch adding more checks.
As a you pointed that can be workaround giving --format=email as a param 
for git show. But it is yet another "useless" param to remember...

So what is recommended way to ensure patch is correct currently?
a) before commit
b) after commit

     checkpatch: validate signature styles and To: and Cc: lines

     Signatures have many forms and can sometimes cause problems if not 
in the
     correct format when using git send-email or quilt.

     Try to verify the signature tags and email addresses to use the 
generally
     accepted "Signed-off-by: Full Name <email@domain.tld>" form.

     Original idea by Anish Kumar <anish198519851985@gmail.com>
