Hi!

This is question from a somewhat confused newbie on this list:

I bought a AzureWave DVB-C card (with CI slot) but have not been able to 
make it work so far. I have mainly played with the package from 
http://jusst.de/manu/mantis-v4l-dvb.tar.bz2. I run Ubuntu Gutsy, kernel 
2.6.22, and it seems to compile ok, but I cannot access the card with 
mythtv.

So: What is the status of this driver? Is it supposed to work, and in 
that case, anyone got some advice on how to proceed (what to check and 
try)? I have been searching through this mail archive, but cannot really 
make out what to do.

Very grateful for any suggestions or advice.


Magnus Larsson
