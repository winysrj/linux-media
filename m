To my knowledge, all the host controller drivers which use DMA _do_
call functions in the DMA API.  So they would still get link errors,
even though the USB core wouldn't.

Therefore adding the appropriate HAS_DMA dependencies should be 
straightforward: Try to build all the drivers and see which ones fail 
to link.
