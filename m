Somehow I detect a totally lack of sincerity there.

But thanks for fixing the worst of this regression, at least.

Perhaps you might think about eventually fixing the bad use of -EINVAL
in future revisions.  One way perhaps to approach that, would be to begin
fixing it internally, but still returning the same things from the actual
f_ops->ioctl() routine.

Then eventually provide new ioctl numbers which return the correct -ENOTTY
(or whatever is best there), rather than converting to -EVINAL at the interface.
Then a nice multi-year overlap, with a scheduled removal of the old codes some day.

Then the input subsystem would work more like most other subsystems,
and make userspace programming simpler and easier to "get correct".

Cheers
