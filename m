Hello,

Reading the last emails I understand that still isn't a consensus on
the way this has to be made. If it has to be implemented at the video
device node level or at the sub-device level. And if it has to be made
in kernel or user-space.

That is the approach we took, we hack the isp v4l2 device driver
(ispvideo) to bypass the ioctls to the sub-device that as the source
pad (tvp5151 in our case, but it could be a sensor as well). So, for
example the VIDIOC_S_STD ioctl handler looks like this (I post a
simplified version of the code, just to give an idea):

static int isp_video_s_std(struct file *file, void *fh, v4l2_std_id *norm)
{
    struct isp_video *video = video_drvdata(file);
    struct v4l2_subdev *sink_subdev;
    struct v4l2_subdev *source_subdev;

    sink_subdev = isp_video_remote_subdev(video, NULL);
    sink_pad = &sink_subdev->entity.pads[0];
    source_pad = media_entity_remote_source(sink_pad);
    source_subdev = media_entity_to_v4l2_subdev(source_pad->entity);
    v4l2_subdev_call(source_subdev, core, s_std, NULL, norm);
}

So applications interact with the /dev/video? via V4L2 ioctls whose
handlers call the sub-dev functions. Is that what you propose?

Yes, that was my question about. But still is not clear to me if
configuring the ISP resizer input and output pads with different frame
sizes automatically means that I have to do the scale or this has to
be configured using a S_FMT ioctl to the /dev/video? node.

Basically what I don't know is when I have to modify the pipeline
graph inside the ISP driver and when this has to be made from
user-space via MCF.

I don't think I can do the cropping and scaling in the tvp5151 driver
since this is a dumb device, it only spits bytes via its parallel
interface. The actual buffer is inside the ISP.
