Yeah, this is a way better!

Btw, if this is always the case, perhaps we could, instead, add a
stub for v4l2_subdev_get_try_format() that would return &cfg->try_fmt.

A patch for tvp5150 had the same issue (and it is also used outside
subdev-based devices).

Perhaps it is time to have stubs for things like that and get
rid on those ugly ifs in the middle of the drivers.

Ok. Anyway, my plan for next week is to try to minimize the number of
warnings... I'm getting a lot were nowadays with newer gcc versions.
