I expect that we could have something to discuss there about complex
cameras. So, I'd reserve a 50 mins slot for it.

The idea is to discuss about the undergoing work with complex camera
development is happening.

As we're working to merge request API, another topic for discussion is
how to add support for requests on it (or on a separate but related
library).

Thanks,
Mauro
