And many thanks to Hans for doing this! Without him, this mini-summit
would not be possible.

A few things related to practical arrangements.

There seems to be a largish conference in Helsinki just at the time
we're having our V4L2 mini-summit and this is the reason it is quite
difficult to book hotel rooms here. We have a quota reservation for the
V4L2 mini-summit between 2010-06-12 -- 2010-06-18 which expires
2010-05-12 (just a bit over two weeks!). After this it may be very
difficult to find rooms, depending on the activity of a certain volcano
in Iceland, though.

Even if you are not absolutely certain of your participation, please
inform me you're interested and I'll send you the hotel reservation
information. Cancelling the reservation without extra fee is possible
(and not difficult at all).

Please also tell if you're happy with being publicly (in this list that
is) listed as a participant to the meeting or not. Otherwise the
assumption is "yes". :)

Sincerely,
