I'm not an udev expert. Is there a udev event that hits only after having
the driver completely loaded? Starting an udev rule while modprobe is
still running is asking for race conditions.

I'm not entirely convinced that this is the bug that Mark is hitting, as
rc-core does all needed setups before registering the evdev device. We
need the core and the dmesg to be sure about what's happening there.

I agree.

I don't like the idea of running a some logic at udev that would generate
such keymap in runtime just before calling the generic tool. The other
alternative (e. g.) to maintain the RC-protocol dependent keytables separate
from the RC protocol used by each table will be a maintenance nightmare.

Yeah. The most appropriate fix would be for X to just use the full evdev
keycode range. However, I'm not seeing any indication that such change
will happen soon. Not sure if there are some news about it at LCA, as
there were one speech about this subject there.

Cheers,
