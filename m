I'm not really assuming that (in fact I expect what you fear, ie. that
most CPUs won't have pages from specified zone an PCP list), however,
I really need to make sure to get them off all PCP lists.

Exactly what's happening now anyway.

Currently, set_migratetype_isolate() seem to do more then it needs to,
ie. it drains all the pages even though all it cares about is a single
zone.

Looks interesting, I'm not entirely sure why it does not end up a race
condition, but in case of __zone_drain_all_pages() we already hold
zone->lock, so my fears are somehow gone..  I'll give it a try, and prepare
a patch for __zone_drain_all_pages().
