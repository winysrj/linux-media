Russell,
Would it change anything here if we define ARCH_HAS_HOLES_MEMORYMODEL, 
as suggested by Marek Szyprowski recently[*], when configuring for 
ARCH_OMAP1 with VIDEO_OMAP1 (camera) selected?

Tony,
With full respect to all Russell's reservations about incorrectness of 
ioremapping SDRAM in general, would you be willing to accept this 
solution in the OMAP1 camera case, taking into account that, quoting 
Russell, "there is no technical problem here", and similiar solutions 
had been accepted recently with other ARM platforms?

Thanks,
Janusz
