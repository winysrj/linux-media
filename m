Actually, the hrtimer fires every 1ms, and that part is something I have to=

do something about, also because it sends of the same number of frames=20
every time, regardless of how accurate the internal timer is to the rest of=

the network (there's no backpressure from the networking layer).

Ah, good point. Any particular parts of the USB-subsystem I should start=20
looking at? Knowing where to start looking is a tremendous help

Thanks for the feedback!
