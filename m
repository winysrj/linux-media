Dma fences can be exported as android fences, just didn't see a need for it yet. :-)
To wait on all implicit fences attached to a dma-buf one could simply poll the dma-buf directly,
or use something like a android userspace fence.

sync_fence_create takes a sync_pt as function argument, but I kept that to keep source code
compatibility, not because it uses any sync_pt functions. Here's a patch to create a userspace
fd for dma-fence instead of a android fence, applied on top of "android: convert sync to fence api".
