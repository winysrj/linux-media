You are an experienced kernel developer. If you still fail to see that

Read it again, it's in the line you skipped in this reply.

> With what application?

patch (like I already did in the past).
But I don't have access to analog TV here at the moment, sorry. It would
have to wait ~2 weeks.

My fault. I shouldn't have wasted any time on reviewing your patch.

Frank
