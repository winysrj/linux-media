it is a 1110 one ( triangular shaped ) but it may be a new design or 
something else. I don't have it here for the moment so i can't give 
exact info but i tried the "card=104" and "card=156" options ( no 
autodetection )  with no result ( analog TV and DVB  didn't work ).
 ( In the meantime, it's back in its box, waiting for a day where it 
will work with my mythbuntu box :) )
