This patch series adds support for the request API (formerly called the
configuration store API: http://www.spinics.net/lists/linux-media/msg81024.html).

This second version takes into account all the feedback I received from
various people and from the discussions in DÃ¼sseldorf last year.

Utilities that understand requests are available here:

http://git.linuxtv.org/cgit.cgi/hverkuil/v4l-utils.git/log/?h=requests

The git repo with these patches is here:

http://git.linuxtv.org/cgit.cgi/hverkuil/media_tree.git/log/?h=requests

Note: this will be rebased to the latest media_tree master on a regular
basis.

The last patch adds a document going into more detail of how everything
works, so refer to that patch to get a good overview of this functionality.

The patch adding request support to vivid is also useful to look at.

DocBook patches are missing since I am waiting for a driver that will
actually need this. If anyone is working on such a driver, then please
let me know.

If anyone has questions, or if anyone has ideas or thinks additional support
for some functionality is needed in the core, then let me know as well.

Regards,

	Hans
