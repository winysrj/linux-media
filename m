Hi everyone,
I need your help. I can't get any sound from the device in the subject.

I'm actually on Gentoo 64bit, vanilla kernel 3.3.0-rc2 with usb-audio 
support and radio-si470x with usb support built-in. I'm using alsa 1.0.25.

When i plug the device I get the following dmesg:

Bus 006 Device 003: ID 06e1:a155 ADS Technologies, Inc. FM Radio 
Receiver/Instant FM Music (RDX-155-EF).

Then I can see the new device /dev/radio0 and in alsamixer there is the 
new usb audio capture device.

The problem is that I can't get any audio from it. If I try to "cat 
/dev/dsp1 > /dev/dsp" I can hear some noise, but I can't tell if that is 
the normal noise of the fm signal or what else.

I also tried with the "radio" utility. It doesn't do anything whatever I 
try. Also it gives me these errors (popping out from the red background)
VIDIOCGAUDIO: Inappropriate ioctl for device â”‚
VIDIOCSAUDIO: Inappropriate ioctl for device

If I try to "radio -c /dev/radio0 -i" to scan for available freqs, it 
just goes from 87.5 to 108.00 in a couple of seconds finding nothing.

I've tried also with a stock Ubuntu 11.10, with exactly the same 
results. Also the first time I plugged the device the software version 
was 0; then I tried it with Windows 7 (where it works), and it updated 
the software to version 1.

So, I'd like to get this device to work; please tell me if there is any 
informatio you need to figure out what's going on.

Thanks, Daniele
