It's another topic.
I agree highmem isn't a gorgeous. But my desktop isn't real machine?
Important thing is that we already have a highmem and many guys
include you(kmap stacking patch :))try to improve highmem problems. :)

No. Until now, many embedded devices have used to small memory. In
that case, only there is a DMA zone in system. But as I know, mobile
phone starts to use big(?) memory like 1G or above sooner or later. So
they starts to use HIGHMEM. Otherwise, 2G/2G space configuration.
Some embedded device uses many thread model to port easily from RTOS.
In that case, they don't have enough address space for application if
it uses 2G/2G model.

So we should care of HIGHMEM in embedded system from now on.
