It is listed at the ELCE/OSS EU website:

	https://events.linuxfoundation.org/events/elc-openiot-europe-2018/register/

It is the same place where you register for the ELCE itself:

	https://www.regonline.com/registration/login.aspx

If you registered before the addition of the Media Summit there, you will
need to change the registration to add yourself. At the confirmation
email, there's a link to access your registration.

Once you click on it, it will open a page that will have a 
<manage your subscription> button. There, you can edit your
subscription and add the Media Summit.

I'll ask.

Thanks,
Mauro
