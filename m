As I told in a previous mail, your code works fine in my DT-based
Cubox. I am rewriting the TDA988x as a normal encoder/connector, and,
yes, the bind/unbind functions are useful in this case.

But you opened a door. In a DT context, you know that the probe_defer
mechanism does not work correctly. Your work permits to solve delicate
cases: your component_add tells exactly when a device is available, and
the master bind callback is the green signal for the device waiting for
its resources. Indeed, your system was not created for such a usage,
but it works as it is (anyway, the component bind/unbind functions may
be empty...).
