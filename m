Hm, I think that was something similar but not quite the same: talking
about having allocations split to lie between two banks of RAM to
maximise the read/write speed for performance reasons.  That's something
that can be handled in the allocator, rather than an API constraint, as
this is.

Not that I know of any hardware which is limited as such, but eh.

Cheers,
Daniel
