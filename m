OK. So the bug is exactly what I said on my very first reply. And the
patch I pointed you to back then should have fixed it:
http://patchwork.kernel.org/patch/45707/
You said it didn't, which makes me wonder if you really tested it
properly...

Anyway this is already fixed upstream, and the fix should be backported
to 2.6.31-stable quickly. I'll make sure it happens.
