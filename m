Subject: Are media drivers abusing of GFP_DMA? - was: Re: [LSF/MM TOPIC
 NOTES] x86 ZONE_DMA love

There was a recent discussion about the use/abuse of GFP_DMA flag when
allocating memories at LSF/MM 2018 (see Luis notes enclosed).

The idea seems to be to remove it, using CMA instead. Before doing that,
better to check if what we have on media is are valid use cases for it, or
if it is there just due to some misunderstanding (or because it was
copied from some other code).

Hans de Goede sent us today a patch stopping abuse at gspca, and I'm 
also posting today two other patches meant to stop abuse of it on USB
drivers. Still, there are 4 platform drivers using it:

	$ git grep -l -E "GFP_DMA\\b" drivers/media/
	drivers/media/platform/omap3isp/ispstat.c
	drivers/media/platform/sti/bdisp/bdisp-hw.c
	drivers/media/platform/sti/hva/hva-mem.c
	drivers/media/spi/cxd2880-spi.c

Could you please check if GFP_DMA is really needed there, or if it is
just because of some cut-and-paste from some other place?

Thanks!
Mauro
