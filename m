For VDR, there is a patch which is difficult to configure and has some technical limitations. In MythTV and XMBC I could not find any support for SCR. Their Wiki pages or forums say, that there are no plans for Unicable support as it would take huge changes.

Ack, this stuff should be implemented as a userspace library.
(Btw, there is an experimental unicable patch for VDR.)
