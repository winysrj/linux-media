A quick audit of the arch code shows you're right - kmap can't fail
anywhere anymore.

I think you'll need to follow the existing kmap semantics and never
fail the iomem version either.  Otherwise you'll have a special case
that's almost never used that has a different error path.

Passing a different flag based on something isn't really much better.

Again, wrong way.  Suddenly making things fail for your special case
that normally don't fail is a receipe for bugs.
