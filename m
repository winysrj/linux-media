Thanks for the information. Philippe Desrochers has reported this,
and found the chip is compatible with SAA7113 [1].

Quoting him:

Guess a bunch of STK1160 devices are now being sold
with the CJC7113 and probably many users are getting hit by this :(

I can try to cook a patch or feel free to do it yourself and post it.

As a quick solution, you can hack saa711x_detect_chip() so it
always returns SAA7113.

We could also add a module parameter to stk1160, to allow
to force the decoder string, but I'd rather have saa7115
autodetection working for all chips.
