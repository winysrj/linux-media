btw, has there been any further thought/discussion on this topic..
I've been experimenting with a drm driver interface on the OMAP SoC.
It is working well now for framebuffer type usage (mode setting,
virtual framebuffer spanning multiple diplays, and those types of
xrandr things)..  the next step that I've started thinking about is
overlay (or underlay.. the z-order is flexible) support..

I was thinking in a similar direction (ie. a special, or maybe not so
special, sort of crtc) and came across this thread, so I thought I'd
resurrect the topic.

In our case, most of the CRTCs in our driver could be used either with
(A)RGB buffers as a traditional framebuffer, or with a few different
formats of YUV as video under/overlays.  So if you had one display
attached, you might only use one CRTC for traditional GUI/gfx layer,
and the rest are available for video.  If you had two displays, then
you'd steal one of the video CRTCs and use it for the gfx layer on the
second display.  And so on.

Rough thinking:
+ add some 'caps' to the CRTC to indicate whether it can handle YUV,
ARGB, scaling
+ add an x/y offset relative to the encoder (as opposed to the
existing x/y offset relative to the framebuffer)
+ add a z-order parameter

Not sure about intel hw if it is supporting clip-rects.. if so, maybe
need to add something about that.  In our case we jut put the video
behind the gfx layer and use the alpha channel in the gfx framebuffer
to clip/blend rather than using clip-rects.

hmm, I guess I know about the OMAP display subsystem, and it's overlay
formats/capabilities.. but not enough about other hw to say anything
intelligent here.  But I guess even if we ignore the format of the
data in the buffer, at least the APIs to setup/attach overlay CRTCs at
various positions could maybe be something we can start with as a
first step.  At least standardizing this part seems like a good first
step.  But I'm definitely interested if someone has some ideas.
