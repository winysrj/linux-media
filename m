I'd like a more detailed version of that story too. It's hard to comment
on this particular example without knowing what happened.

Agreed. I don't think the "9000 lines revert" is relevant anymore as
such. What matters is how to keep existing and attract new developers,
by making the linux-media subsystem attractive and easy and pleasant to
work with.

It won't be enough though. Testing is crucial to scale, but isn't a
substitute for review, it won't solve the review bottleneck by itself.

No, please. *Nobody* *ever* should have review bypass rights, there is
no single exception to that rule. I fully agree we should get more
people on-board and give them trees on linuxtv.org, but that's not about
skipping review.

I agree with Sakari, there was clearly no majority, that's not true.
