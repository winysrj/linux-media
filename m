Hi Jarod,

Please add a TODO file at staging/lirc, describing what's needed for
the drivers to move to the IR branch.

Greg,

It is probably simpler to merge those files via my tree, as they depend
on some changes scheduled for 2.6.36.

Would it be ok for you if I merge them from my tree?

Cheers,
Mauro
