I prepared a long answer to your email, but I guess we're not at the
same page.

Let be clear on my view. Please let me know where you disagree:

1) I'm not defending Javier's patchset. I have my restrictions to
it too. My understanding is that he sent this as a RFC for feeding
our discussions for the media summit.

Javier, please correct me if I'm wrong.

2) I don't understand what you're calling as "meta-pads". For me, a
PAD is a physical set of pins. 

3) IMO, the best is to have just one PAD for a decoder input. That makes
everything simple, yet functional.

In my view, the input PAD will be linked to several "input connections".
So, in the case of tvp5150, it will have:

	- composite 1
	- composite 2
	- s-video

4) On that view, the input PAD is actually a set of pins. In the
case of tvp5150, the pins that compose the input PADs are
AIP1A and AIP1B.

The output PAD is also a set of pins YOUT0 to YOUT7, plus some other
pins for sync. Yet, it should, IMHO, have just one output PAD at
the MC graph.
