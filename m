Hi Kernellabs or anyone involved with driver development of the HVR-2200...

I know this is a loooong way down the priority list of features to be added, if ever!
But I'm wanting to know if the *possibility* is there 'hardware-wise' for the following:

1) h.263/mpeg4/VC-1/DivX/Xvid hardware encode of A/V-in
2) Component input for the A/V-in
3) Hw encode bypass for A/V-in
4) Is Hw encode purely for A/V-in? (hauppauge's site suggests otherwise but it may be a typo)
5) If not then questions 1) & 3) also apply to RF-in!

Here are the reference cards spec sheets again:

I would be proactive in providing feed-back (as needed) for the dev. of such features.

Most Sincerely,
Jed
