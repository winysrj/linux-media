If you want to have a chance to get this in 2.6.31 then you have to be 
quick, and even then I can't guarantee anything. It will depend on Mauro to 
a large extent. The 2.6.31 merge window is now open but will close in 1-2 
weeks. After that it depends on Mauro whether he will allow it to be 
merged.

It's a pretty tight schedule, I'm afraid.

Regards,
