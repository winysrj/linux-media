Check the "To" field.  In the case of your message, it shows "linux-dvb@linuxtv.org" on my end.  Set your mailer to match this address in any/all headers and you'll probably catch everything destined for this list.

I'm of the opinion that [linux-dvb] and similar really should be *stripped* from the subject line of mailing lists in general, since there are other ways to identify mailing lists (such as the "List-Id" header field, which is also valid for this list).  I've set Kmail to sort in a similar manner, with each list's messages going into their appropriate mail folders.
