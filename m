>From the arm64 side, the only concern I have (and this actually applies to
our CSDB sequence as well) is the calculation of the array size by the
caller. As Linus mentioned at the end of [1], if the determination of the
size argument is based on a conditional branch, then masking doesn't help
because you bound within the wrong range under speculation.

We ran into this when trying to use masking to protect our uaccess routines
where the conditional bound is either KERNEL_DS or USER_DS. It's possible
that a prior conditional set_fs(KERNEL_DS) could defeat the masking and so
we'd need to throw some heavy barriers in set_fs to make it robust.

The question then is whether or not we're likely to run into this elsewhere,
and I don't have a good feel for that.
