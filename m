Yes, exactly. The wording is just not 100% precise and I haven't found 
something better so far.

Yes, exactly as well. As soon as at least one importer says "I can't do 
this", we must fallback to the old behavior.

No, with this idea invalidation is asynchronous. Already discussed that 
with Daniel as well and YES Daniel also already pointed out that I need 
to better document this.

When the exporter calls invalidate_mappings() it just means that all 
importers can no longer use their sg tables for new submissions, old 
ones stay active.

The existing sg tables are guaranteed to stay valid until all fences in 
the reservation object have signaled and the importer should also delay 
it's call to call dma_buf_unmap_attachment() until all the fences have 
signaled.

When the importer has new work to do, e.g. wants to attach a new fence 
to the reservation object, it must grab a new sg table for that. The 
importer also needs to make sure that all new work touching the dma-buf 
doesn't start before the exclusive fence in the reservation object signals.

This allows for full grown pipelining, e.g. the exporter can say I need 
to move the buffer for some operation. Then let the move operation wait 
for all existing fences in the reservation object and install the fence 
of the move operation as exclusive fence.

The importer can then immediately grab a new sg table for the new 
location of the buffer and use it to prepare the next operation.

Christian.
