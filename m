Subject: [PATCH] lirc.4: remove ioctls and feature bits which were never
 implemented
Message-ID: <20180423102637.xtcjidetxo6iaslx@gofer.mess.org>
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii
Content-Disposition: inline
Sender: linux-media-owner@vger.kernel.org
List-ID: <linux-media.vger.kernel.org>

The lirc header file included ioctls and feature bits which were never
implemented by any driver. They were removed in commit:

https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/commit/?id=d55f09abe24b4dfadab246b6f217da547361cdb6
