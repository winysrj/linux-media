The following series implements small updates to the fence api.
I've found them useful when implementing the fence API in ttm and i915.

The last patch enables RCU on top of the api. I've found this less
useful, but it was the condition on which Thomas Hellstrom was ok
with converting TTM to fence, so I had to keep it in.

If nobody objects I'll probably merge that patch through drm, because
some care is needed in ttm before it can flip the switch on rcu.
