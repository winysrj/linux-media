Yes, it can use and IOMMU should not treat is specially. That's the
aim of my patch:
[PATCH v2 3/3] omap: iovmm: don't check 'da' to set IOVMF_DA_FIXED flag
I'm not advocating to not allow 0x0, but to not use it when user is
not requesting fixed da. In many sw architecture decisions 0x0 address
is a special case. To avoid any misuse, IOMMU will not use it unless
it's requested. If user is not requesting fixed 'da', it's not a
problem to not give 0x0 anyway. IMO that's the safer option for all
cases.

That can be done, of course. But the main point is in OMAP3 ISP all
initial register values to read/write from/to memory are 0x0. It means
sometimes we can catch bugs more easily by not mapping that address.
So, IMO, OMAP3 ISP should not allow to map first page. But that's a
special case for this driver only.
