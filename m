This is confirmed. I quote:

"There is no fee for the Collaboration Summit, but it is invitation only
to control attendance.  However, if you register for ELC, you are
automatically accepted for attendance at the Collab Summit.
So essentially, one registration fee (for ELC) covers both."

I also received confirmation that the Linux Foundation can reserve a room
for a summit meeting from April 14-16 (so during the Collaboration Summit).

So let's target those dates for a summit meeting. It fits nicely with the
actual Embedded Linux Conference, I think.
