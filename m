I think that every contribution, as long as it acctually fixes
something, is worth the patch. The beauty of the open source community
is that we do when we have time as much as we are able to do - totally
no stress.

You, Pavel, are more experienced however those who are not have to learn
somehow and one of the options is to start with something very simple.
Sometimes the 'simple' means oneliner however as long as it compiles, is
inline with the coding standard and in general is an improvement then it
is good.

Konrad
