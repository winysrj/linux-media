Yes, all the parts where multiple protocols make sense use a bitmap of
protocols. If there's any part which uses a bitmap where only one
protocol makes sense that'd be a bug...

The fact that you might want to be able to receive and decode more than
one protocol has no bearing on encoding when you're supposed to know
what it is you want to encode....

But it makes no sense? "here's a scancode...I have no idea what it means
since only knowing the protocol allows you to make any sense of the
scancode...but please encode it to something...anything...."
