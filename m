Hi !
After a change  on Transponder 11303 on Astra 19.2 (adding  of  ORF HD)  
it is not longer possible to get  a lock with mantis based cards.

Users on vdrportal have reported that other cards do not have problems.

All TT S2 3200 users ( like myself)  are not able to get a lock on that 
transponder anymore. 
So "ServusTV HD" (one of the not to many HD freeview channels) is no 
longer accessible.

I have tried recent liplianin drivers, and some old "multiproto_plus" 
drivers without success.

Hope somebody can help.

Peter
