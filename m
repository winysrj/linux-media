I have the hardware - both ES1968 (SF64-PCE2-04) and FM801 cards (SF64-PCR) 
with these tuners. I remember fixing mute in tea5757x-tuner back in 2009 
(testing it on SF64-PCR).

I don't like that either. I've done a quick hack - copied radio support from 
fm801 and radio_bits_get() and radio_bits_set() from radio-maestro to es1968 
and it seems to basically work.
Now I just need some more time to finish it, then move everything good from 
radio-maestro to tea575x-tuner and delete radio-maestro.

IIRC, the TEA5757 tuner is also present on at least one ISA radio card - 
SF16-FMR2 (which I also have).
