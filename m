Manu,

I see great value in separating the history of the data files from the
code files.  If you really think this is such a terrible task for a
developer to have to pull from a second repository to fetch these data
files, then I find no reason why we couldn't script it such that
building the dvb-apps package would trigger the pull from the
additional repository.

I think that's a fair compromise.

Meanwhile, your argument is for developers.  Developers can handle
pulling from a separated tree for data files who shouldn't be clouding
the history of source code development, anyway.  Developers are indeed
used to dealing with multiple repositories, and if any developer
isn't, then now is the time to get with the program!

I think this change is a great idea, and I would hope that we'd all
agree on this, at least.

Best Regards,

Mike Krufky
