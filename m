According to:
http://www.linuxtv.org/wiki/index.php/TerraTec_Cinergy_T_USB_RC

Pinnacle Expresscard 320cx 	âœ” Yes, in kernel since 2.6.26 	2304:022e
USB2.0 		dvb-usb-dib0700-1.20.fw

I've just bought this card and it is correctly recognized and
initialized, however it doesn't work. Precisely: tvtime and similar
applications say: `no video device' and no /dev/video0 nor similar
device files are created. Does the _analog_ part work? Am I missing sth?
