So disable them. I think most people would rather have this support
enabled so that remotes Just Work if a DTV card or stand-alone IR receiver
is plugged in without having to hunt back through Kconfig options to
figure out why it doesn't...

No. As Andy said, there are stand-alone devices, such as the Windows Media
Center Ed. eHome Infrared Transceivers which are simply a usb device, no
direct relation to any TV devices. A fair number of systems these days are
also shipping with built-in CIR support by way of a sub-function on an LPC
SuperIO chip. Remotes can be used to control more than just changing
channels on a TV tuner card (think music player, video playback app
streaming content from somewhere on the network, etc).
