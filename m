Hi everyone. Today I've been setting up my FlyDVB-T Duo. The card
seems to work for the most part. The only issue I've had is that I can
only get some of the channels.

I live in the UK, which uses freeview. My nearest transmitter is in
Hannington. It's details are listed here:
http://www.ukfree.tv/txdetail.php?a=SU527568

Unfortunately, I can only pick up stuff from "Mux 1". I've tried the
following programs to find other channels:

Me-TV
Kaffeine
scan
w_scan

None of them turn up any channels other than the Mux 1 channels. When
I run the card in Vista, it picks up these other channels fine.

There's details, logs, etc here:
http://www.linuxtv.org/wiki/index.php/LifeView_FlyDVB-T_Duo under
"Mini how-to".

I got partially through writing the howto when I hit problems. That's
why the details are there.

I'm happy to supply any more details, but please check the wiki page first.

Any help would be really appreciated! :)
