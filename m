Correct, any attempt to specify a filesystem-dax mapping range to
get_user_pages_longterm will fail with EOPNOTSUPP. In the future we
want to add something like a 'struct file_lock *' argument to
get_user_pages_longterm so that the kernel has a handle to revoke
access to the returned pages. Once we have a safe way for the kernel
to undo elevated page counts we can stop failing the longterm vs
filesystem-dax case.

Here is more background on why _longterm gup is a problem for filesystem-dax:

DAX is currently global setting for the entire backing device of the
filesystem, so any mapping of any file when the "-o dax" mount option
is set is in the "FS_DAX control range". In other words there's
currently no way to prevent FS_DAX mappings from being exposed to V4L2
outside of CONFIG_FS_DAX=n.

Without finding the code videobuf-vmalloc sounds like it should be ok
if the kernel is allocating memory separate from a file-backed DAX
mapping. Where is the VB2 get_user_pages call?
