Not sure what happened here. I'm sure I've applied on my fixes tree.
Anyway, I'm re-applying it.

Here, Dec, 31 is a national holiday. People work only half of the day.
Yet, I was finishing some things and preparing patches for the incoming 
window, until afternoon.

I only noticed your email today, and I'm promptly sending it upstream,
together with a patch revert for wm8775 regression.

I'm sending it right now.

Shit happens. A patch adding support for one board might cause regression on
other boards, as it is not likely that the author of the patch have all
boards that could potentially be affected. That's why we have a long rc
period, where people with different hardware are expected to test the -rc
kernels and point for regressions.
