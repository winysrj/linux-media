Subject: which fm cards/hardware work with linux kernel 3.x?

hi all,

I'm a linux-media user who for many years used an fm radio card.

After recent kernel updates, fm no longer works.  I frankly, don't
know enough to determine where the problem lies--whether it's hardware
or out of date drivers or unmaintained code.

FM Radio seems to join the "dustbins of tech" along with teletype,
wire recorders, and, am radio. For now it's still very helpful for
legally recording OTA broadcasts.

I'm ready to upgrade my fm card.

If you know a working solution--specific fm cards or usb fm
receivers-- as well as any software tweaks--please respond to this
thread or email me directly.

thanks in advance,

will
