In the case of 3G modem x USB storage only, it is possible to handle it on userspace.

However, when there are more functions added, an they're not (completely) mutually exclusive,
then I don't see an easy way (if is there a way) for doing it at userspace.

Several devices offer more than one function at the same time, but some
resources are mutually exclusive. A TV stick with just one tuner, and
both analog and digital demods offer both analog and digital TV at the
same time. So, both analog and digital parts of the driver will offer
the device to userspace. However, unpredictable results will happen if
userspace tries to use both at the same time.

The Digital camera devices that offer PTP transfers and V4L support also
fall at the same type of trouble. Some of those devices just delete
all pictures from the memory, if streaming is started. So, receiving
an automatic Skype video call may delete all pictures you took.

Worse than that, currently, the PTP protocol is handled via libusb, while
streaming is done via V4L2 API.

The best technical approach, IMO, is to implement the PTP protocol in
kernelspace, and do some sort of inter-subsystem locking to prevent such
troubles.
