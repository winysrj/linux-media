Hmm... it seems that you didn't read the sites I've pointed on my original
email, or that I was not clear enough. 

The Media Subsystem Workshop and the Kernel Summit won't happen in Vancouver.
What will happen there is the LinuxCon North-America, plus the USB mini-summit. 
I should be there, btw. I think I should add an additional topic there to
discuss about multi-featured devices.

The KS/2011 and the Media Workshop will happen in Prague, on Oct 23-25,
just before the LinuxCon Europe.

Mauro
