Subject: [PATCH][Trivial][resend] Documentation: Add newline at end-of-file
 to files lacking one
Message-ID: <alpine.LNX.2.00.1207202232240.23164@swampdragon.chaosbits.net>
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: TEXT/PLAIN; charset=US-ASCII
Sender: linux-media-owner@vger.kernel.org
List-ID: <linux-media.vger.kernel.org>

This patch simply adds a newline character at end-of-file to those
files in Documentation/ that currently lack one.

This is done for a few different reasons:

A) It's rather annoying when you do "cat some_file.txt" that your
   prompt/cursor ends up at the end of the last line of output rather
   than on a new line.

B) Some tools that process files line-by-line may get confused by the
   lack of a newline on the last line.

C) The "\ No newline at end of file" line in diffs annoys me for some
   reason.

So, let's just add the missing newline once and for all.
