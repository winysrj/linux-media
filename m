Yeah, loosk good to me and rather useful, so (with the dma-buf docs
improved as suggested below):

I've also written some small prime tests in igt, so also:

I think adding a section about various other userspace interfaces exposed
below the mmap support section would be good. Feel free to squash in the
belo diff for v2.

Cheers, Daniel

+Other Interfaces Exposed to Userspace on the dma-buf FD
+------------------------------------------------------

+- Since kernel 3.12 the dma-buf FD supports the llseek system call, but only
+  with offset=0 and whence=SEEK_END|SEEK_SET. SEEK_SET is supported to allowe
+  the usual size discover pattern size = SEEK_END(0); SEEK_SET(0). Every other

+
+  If llseek on dma-buf FDs isn't support the kernel will report -ESPIPE for all

+  size using llsee.
