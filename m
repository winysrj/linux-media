Not loaded pciehp driver? Remove the device from this slot without poweroff ?

Hi Chris,
   What about use #modprobe pciehp pciehp_debug=1 pciehp_poll_mode=1 pciehp_poll_time=1 ?

Can you resend the dmesg log and "lspci -vvv" info after hotplug device from your Fujitsu laptop with above module parameters?

Thanks!
Yijing.
