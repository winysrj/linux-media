Good day all!

I saw an article this morning that MPH is being rolled out in the US
and I am interested in creating a car PC capable of DVR functionality
based on Microtune's MT2067. I tried searching for adapters online,
but only found articles related to the chip itself. Has anyone seen a
Linux adapter which will work with this tuner? Is anyone working on a
driver for the tuner?

Thanks in advance,

Brandon
