I seem to have patches I haven't had time to push back then:

<URL:http://salottisipuli.retiisi.org.uk/cgi-bin/gitweb.cgi?p=~sailus/linux.git;a=shortlog;h=refs/heads/leds-as3645a>

This seems to be mostly in line with what has been discussed in the meeting,
except that the patches add a device specific property. Please ignore the
led patches in that tree for now (i.e. four patches on the top are the
relevant ones here).
