UCB is just DTV_QOS_ERROR_BLOCK_COUNT. 

PER is DTV_QOS_ERROR_BLOCK_COUNT / DTV_QOS_TOTAL_BLOCKS_COUNT

Not all frontends will of course provide PER.

Hmm... good point.

Let's see when those counters would overflow with u64 (please correct
if I did any wrong calculus on bc).

We have:
	2^64 = 18,446,744,073,709,551,616

Assuming a bit rate of 54 Mbps, we have:
	bits_per_sec = (54*1024*1024*1024)
	bits_per_sec = 57,982,058,496

In this case, the bit error count will overflow in:
	time_to_overflow = 2^64 seconds / bits_per_sec =
			 = 18,446,744,073,709,551,616 / 57,982,058,496
		         = 318,145,725 seconds
So,
	time_to_overflow is more than 3682 days and more than 10 years

DTV_QOS_TOTAL_BLOCKS_COUNT increments slower than DTV_QOS_TOTAL_BITS_COUNT
(204 * 8 times slower).

So, it would take 318,145,725 * 204 * 8 seconds (or 6,009,419 days) to
overflow).

IMHO, except for professional applications that would be continuously
running for more than 10 years , there's no need to be
careful about overflows.

That said, I still think that the counters should be reset when
a new channel is tuned (e. g. when set_frontend is called from
userspace) or when the user requests for a counters reset, as the 
statistics from one channel/transponder are different than the ones
for other channels/transponders.
