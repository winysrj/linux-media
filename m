> The kernel IR protocol decoder works with nanoseconds length for the pulses/silences, while the IR receiver is sending back a runlenght encoded bytes with the number of ticks at 38KHz (I suppose it is 38Khz, as it is the most common carrier). While doing an hexdump of these IR bytes returned by the device, I could discern their encoding: the higher bit is the indicator of pulses (1) or space (0), the next 7 bits encode the higher 7 bits of a 8 bit counter, dropping the lowest bit (you lose precision, but increase the range of possible values from 127 to 255, reducing the chance of needing multiple bytes to encode a single value). The formula in the macro '#define TICSAT38KHZTONS(x) ((x) * (1000000000/38000))', and why it was feed with 'TICSAT38KHZTONS(((u32)(buf[i] & 0x7F)) << 1)' should be now easier to understand.

Aah, now I see, it is not 1GHz but 1 second in nanoseconds. Yeah, seems 
like that calculation is very near. There is some inner logic inside 
chip to calculate nanoseconds from the reference clock. I think 28.800 
MHz is the only possible reference clock so it is easy.

> As a bonus, found attached a statistics of the frequency and count of commands for the remote controls in available on "Remote Central"[1], as you can see the most common carrier frequency is 38KHz or some light variations of it (36, 40 comes next). This list is at least 5 years old, but I dont think there should be any variations with the possible current values.
