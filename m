I have the following question, who or what can help me with some information on the specific differences, from a programming viewpoint, between the "media controller" and "int device" frameworks for V4L2?  A checklist for forward and back porting is what I seek, but I don't expect such a thing to exist.  However, I believe someone on here may have the knowledge to author such a list, and I would be willing to pay reasonably for it.
