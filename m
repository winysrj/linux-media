A dual tuner PCI-E DVB-S2 card?

A fair few people are probably now trying to move away from legacy
(PCI) kit and at the moment the DVB-S2 PCIe area is quite badly
served.

I realise it's dependant upon your time availability and getting hold
of hardware/information to develop a driver, however if you could keep
it in mind that would be great.

If there's a particular card that catches your eye let me know and
I'll see if I can help sourcing one.

Regards
