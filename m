I was wondering if the support for this card is fixed or is going to be

fixed in some tree?
I know that there has been support for the card in manu:s Mantis tree
but hasn't been working for a long time.
For some reason the interface has been disabled in the sourcecode.

Hopefully there will be support for the card so I can get it running for
my HTPC .. or is there some other card that has CA-module support that
work on linux out there?
