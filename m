Heh.  Ther's a female in another tank - the male does the head bobbing and
the female does the arm waving.  Pretty cute mating ritual.  I'm waiting
on my daugther to set up the female tank properly and then we'll add the
girl-lizard cam.  Whee!

The camera shoots at about 7 fps and the video is shown at 30 fps; motion
drops any frames that don't have motion so the time compression is pretty
severe.  The whole video covers about 2-3 days so the lizard isn't *that*
active.  (by comparison, the snake cam covers 2 months; snakes spend most
of their time not moving.....)

You are an adult when you realize that everyone's an idiot sometimes. You
are wise when you include yourself.
