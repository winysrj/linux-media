I have serious doubts whether this is actually supported. I see no mention of
that board in the cx23885 driver. I wonder if there is a mixup between the
ImpactVCB (which IS supported) and the ImpactVCB-e.

You can try some of the existing cards: one  of 1, 2, 3, 6, 20, 24, 32 might
just work. Look in drivers/media/pci/cx23885/cx23885-cards.c.

Each card definition there defines the inputs that are supported by the card.
There is no perfect match, so you will have to change inputs to see which
input produces an image. You can also add a card definition yourself and
just fiddle around with the vmux/amux/gpio values to see which work. It is
probably something close to what is used by other Hauppauge cards.

There is no point in using the daily build. The cx23885 driver hasn't been
updated in a long time.
