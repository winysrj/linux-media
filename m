Didn't have to bisect it. The problem is caused by

commit 59529081e092506edb81a42d914e2d0522f65ca7
Author: Laurent Pinchart <laurent.pinchart@ideasonboard.com>

    V4L/DVB: uvcvideo: Cache control min, max, res and def query results

which reverts cleanly, but then the driver doesn't compile and one also
needs to revert

commit cf7a50eeb6f462a0b7d1619fcb27a727a2981769
Author: Laurent Pinchart <laurent.pinchart@ideasonboard.com>
Date:   Sun Apr 25 16:27:14 2010 -0300

    V4L/DVB: uvcvideo: Prevent division by 0 when control step value is 0

and

commit e54532e591cd5b9ce77dbc8d9786ae9f600f101a
Author: Laurent Pinchart <laurent.pinchart@ideasonboard.com>
Date:   Sat Jan 23 07:07:53 2010 -0300

    V4L/DVB: uvcvideo: Clamp control values to the minimum and maximum values
