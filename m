Subject: MSI StarCam 370i: The right way?

I have just installed a new Kubuntu 9.10 install with the
2.6.31-14-generic (stock) kernel. I need to get an MSI StarCam i370
working on this machine. The lsusb command shows the device as such:
Bus 003 Device 002: ID 0c45:60fc Microdia PC Camera with Mic (SN9C105)

Without having configured anything, Ekiga 3.2.5 and Skype 2.1.0.47
shows do not show any video, Cheese shows coloured bars, Camorama
complains that there is no video at dev/video0, and Kopete locks up
when I try to show video in the configuration menu.

I have tried many different methods of troubleshooting and installed
many different packages in the past (on different distros), with
varying levels of success but nothing satisfactory. Please tell me,
what is the "right way" to go from here? What do I need to check /
install? Thanks!
