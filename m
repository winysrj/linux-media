Yeah, there are lots of EINVAL there, as the API is fairly complex
(about 80 ioctl's for V4L, plus a similar set for DVB),  but there's
an ioctl dispatcher inside the V4L core that handles the ENOTTY case,
at drivers/media/video/v4l2-ioctl.c.

You'll see some -EINVAL things there, but they're due to errors
on parameters (the semantics there is somewhat complex, to avoid
returning -ENOTTY where a -EINVAL should be returned, instead).

In summary, the code there is:

static long __video_do_ioctl(struct file *file,
                unsigned int cmd, void *arg)
{
...
        long ret = -ENOTTY;
...
	switch (cmd) {
		/*
		 * several ioctl callbacks here. if they're not
		 * implemented, break (e. g. -ENOTTY will be returned).
		 */
...
	}
...
        return ret;

The context there is too big for noticing it with a few lines of
context, and too complex as well, as some ioctl's may be implemented 
by more than one callback, depending on what's needed, and some 
others have a default implementation there. This is somewhat similar 
to file ops callbacks.

Sure. I'm currently traveling, so I have just my "first aids kit" of devices
but they should be enough for testing it. I'll return you as soon as I finish
compiling the kernel on this slow 4 years-old notebook and run some
tests with the usual applications.
