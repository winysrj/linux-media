Seconded.

To those of you who are dissatisfied with the speed at which device
support is coming: do what I did a year ago: learn the codebase and
start submitting patches.

This is an understaffed project done by volunteers for no money.
Being abused by users who feel they have some entitlement to having
their devices supported is unacceptable.

If you want commercial level support than I would suggest you find a
consultant that you can pay for such work.

Regards,

Devin
