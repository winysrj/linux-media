Dear Good day,
I sent this mail praying for it to reach you in good health, since I myself are in a very critical health condition in which I sleep every night without knowing if I may be alive to see the next day. I am Mrs. Gangadai Nankishore, a widow suffering from long time illness. I have some funds I inherited from my late husband, the sum of (US$18,3 Million Dollars) my Doctor told me recently that I would not last due to the illness. Having known my condition, I decided to donate this fund to a good person that will utilize it the way i am going to instruct herein. I need a very honest and God fearing person who can claim this money and use it for Charity works, for orphanages, widows and also build schools for less privilege that will be named after my late husband if possible.

I accept this decision because I do not have any child who will inherit this money after I die.

Please I want your sincerely and urgent answer to know if you will be able to execute this project, and I will give you more information on how the fund will be transferred to your bank account.

I am waiting for your reply,

Mrs.Gangadai Nankishore
