Yes you did, I remember quite well, and no, I didn't listen :)

At the time, there were other issues that I had to address. The=20
configfs-part is fairly isolated. As I tried to explain the last round,=20
the *reason* I've used ConfigFS thus far, is because it makes it pretty=20
easy from userspace to signal the driver to create a new alsa-device.

And the reason I haven't changed configfs, is because so far, that part has=
=20
worked fairly well and have made testing quite easy. At this stage, *this*=
=20
is what is helpful, not a perfect interface. This does not mean that=20
configfs is set in stone.

To clearify:
I'm sending out a new set now because, what I have works _fairly_ well for=
=20
testing and a way to see what you can do with AVB. Using spotify to play=20
music on random machines is quite entertaining.

It is by no means -done-, nor do I consider it done. I have been tight on=
=20
time, and instead of sitting in an office polishing on some code, I thought=
=20
it better to send out a new (and not done) set of patches so that others=20
could see it still being worked on. If this turned out to be noise-only, I=
=20
appologize!

I was not able to find a sane way to change the mode of the NIC, some of=20
the settings required to enable Qav-mode must be done when bringing the=20
NIC up, so I needed hooks in _probe().

ANother elemnt needed is a way for tsn_core to ascertain if a NIC is=20
capable of TSN or not (this would be ndo_tsn_capable)

Then finally, you need to update values in a per-tx-queue manner when a new=
=20
stream is ready (hence ndo_tsn_link_configure).

What you mean by 'driver specific hacks' is not obvious though, TSN=20
requires a set of fairly standardized parameters (priority code points,=20
size of frames to send in a new stream and so on), adding this to the=20
hw-registers in the NIC is an operation that will be common for all=20
TSN-capable NICs.

I like feedback when it's short, sweet and to the point

So you did raise a lot of good points the last round, and no, I have not=20

Yes, I fully agree, as far as I know, no-one is working on this. That being=
=20
said, I have not paid much attention the userspace tooling lately. But all=
=20
of this must be handled in userspace, having avdecc in the kernel would be=
=20
an utter nightmare :)

And therein lies the problem. It cannot yet be written, so we have to start=
=20
in *some* end. And as I repeatedly stated in June, I'm at an RFC here,=20
trying to spark some interest and lure other developers in :)

Also, I really do not want a media-application to care about _where_ the=20
frames are going. Sure, I see the issue of configuring a link, but that can=
=20
be done from _outside_ the media-application. VLC (or aplay, or totem, or=
=20
=2E. take your pick) should not have to worry about this.

Applications that require finer control over timestamping is easier to=20
adapt to AVB than all the others, I'd rather add special knobs for those=20
who are interested than adding a set of knobs that -all- applications must=
=20
be aware of.

Could be that we are talking about the same thing, just from different=20
perspectives.

I need to revisit that discussion again I think.

Yes, indeed, that would be one good solution, and quite a lot of work.

To nitpick a bit, all AD/DAs should match that of the gPTP grandmaster=20
(which in most settings would be the Talker). But yes, you need to adjust=
=20
the AD/DA. SRC is slow and painful, best to avoid.

Yes, some hook into adjusting the clock is needed, I wonder if this is=20
possible via V4L2, or of the monitor-world is a completely different beast.

Yes, and this requires a lot of change to ALSA (and probably something in=
=20
V4L2 as well?), so before we get to that, perhaps have a set of patches=20
that does this best effort and *then* work on getting time-triggered=20
playback into the kernel?

Another item that was brought up last round was getting timing-information=
=20
to/from ALSA, See driver/media/avb/avb_alsa.c, as a start it updates the=20
time for last incoming/outgoing frame so that userspace can get that=20
information. Probably buggy as heck :)

Some (well, to be honest, most) of the of the critical functions that my=20
driver omits, are omitted because they require substantial effort to=20
implement - and befor there's a need for this, that won't happen. So,=20
consider the TSN-driver such a need!

I'd love to use a qdisc that uses a time-triggered transmit, that would=20
drop the need for a lot of the stuff in tsn_core.c. The same goes for=20
time-triggered playback in media.

Ah, a proverbial slip of the changelog, we visited this the last iteration,=
=20
that would be the ravb-driver (which is an AVB capable NIC), but it does=20
not include much in the way of AVB-support *In* kernel. Sorry about that!

Since then, the iMX7 from NXP has arrived, and this also has HW-support for=
=20
TSN, but not in the kernel AFAICT.

So, the next issue I plan to tackle, is how I do buffers, the current=20
approach where tsn_core allocates memory is on its way out and I'll let the=
=20
shim (which means alsa/v4l2) will provide a buffer. Then I'll start looking=
=20
at qdisc.

Thanks!
