Yes.  We have seen CPUs which lockup or crash as a result of mismatched
attributes in the page tables.

See my other comment in an earlier email.  See the patch which prevents
ioremap() being used on system memory.  There is active movement at the
present time to sorting these violations out and find solutions for
them.

The last thing we need is a new API which introduces new violations.

Xscale doesn't suffer from the problem.  V6 doesn't aggressively speculate.
V7 speculates more aggressively, and corruption has been seen there.

Look, I've been pointing out this problem ever since the very _first_
CMA patches were posted to the list, yet the CMA proponents have decided
to brush those problems aside each and every time I've raised them.

So, you should be asking _why_ the CMA proponents are choosing to ignore
this issue completely, rather than working to resolve it.

If it's resolved, then the problem goes away.

What the fsck do you think I've been doing?  This is NOT THE FIRST time
I've raised this issue.  I gave up raising it after the first couple
of attempts because I wasn't being listened to.

You say about _me_ not being very helpful.  How about the CMA proponents
start taking the issue I've raised seriously, and try to work out how
to solve it?  And how about blaming them for the months of wasted time
on this issue _because_ _they_ have chosen to ignore it?
