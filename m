Dan,

Your logic is correct, however, I didn't apply this patch because it broke
the driver.

I'll need to re-visit the driver when I have some time, in order to be
able to apply this one, without breaking the driver. I'll likely need to
change some other things on this routine.

(this has a low priority, as the driver is working properly the way it is).

So, I'm keeping your patch at patchwork, while I don't find some time for it.

Regards,
Mauro
