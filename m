Hi all,

I wonder if anyone knows a reasonably priced big-endian system with a PCI 
slot that I can use to test PCI capture cards with a big-endian linux 
installation. Preferable something small like a mini-ITX board.

I haven't been able to find anything yet, but perhaps someone has an idea of 
where to find something like this?

Thanks,

	Hans
