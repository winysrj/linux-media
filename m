Hi, Mauro

I'm sorry for the late reply, I'm at work.
Thanks a lot for the explanation. Such refactoring seems a bit out of
my reach, for the time being (though apparently a nice opportunity to
learn Git-fu, I'm intoxicated by CVS), but at least now I understand
what is really happening.
I may try and hack the code a bit and see what comes out, but don't
wait for me, by all means. I only have a general idea of how the
kernel works (I understand C, but stopped writing it about ten years
ago, as I do Java for a living).


Thanks, once again,

Rui Salvaterra
