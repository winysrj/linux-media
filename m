balbi,

  Agree , interrupt pkts could have handled in thread context . But in
the current way , FM driver never create any additional task in the
system
  to handle FM interrupt. In fact, there is no task being created in
this driver to handle FM RDS data, AF,etc.

  This method is suitable for light weight system where we want to
reduce number of thread in the system.
