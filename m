Those seem to improve it. But there are some bugs still:

1) If the device is inserted/removed quickly several times, the machine deadly
crashes. I tested it with alsa module, and also without it.

2) If the device got removed while streaming, bad things happen.

This is what happens with both audio and video streaming (analog mode):

	[  233.084393] usb 3-2: USB disconnect, device number 2
	[  233.084936] em28xx_audio_isocirq, status -108, 64 packets (size 4416)
	[  233.085024] em2882/3 #0: disconnecting em2882/3 #0 video
	[  233.085092] em2882/3 #0: V4L2 device vbi0 deregistered
	[  233.085630] em2882/3 #0: V4L2 device video1 deregistered
	[  233.086402] em2882/3 #0: Device is open ! Memory deallocation is deferred on last close.

Logs are ok, but the application (xawtv) refuses to die.

I manually removed em28xx-alsa from /lib/modules/.../usb/em28xx. After
such change, device removal while streaming worked.

3) DVB removal while streaming worked relatively well:

[  513.709376] usb 3-2: USB disconnect, device number 5
[  513.709666] em2882/3 #0: disconnecting (null)

	Note that the device name is "(null)" here.

In summary, it seems that there are still two bugs:

a) the error patch during device initialization has likely bugs;

b) there are still some things missing on em28xx-alsa, in order to
properly handle device removal.

Yet, there are some improvements on this series. If nobody complains, I'll
likely merge this series in a few days.
