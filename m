Hi, Rod:

I'm just a little owner of T750, and not a electrical circuit expert. I just 
can read some code of kernel drivers. I do definitly want to give you a hand 
and make this cards work over v4l, but what can I do for you? I live in 
Taiwan, if it necessary and Compro wants to tell me, I can give Compro a call 
and ask some questions which may keep this branch forward.
