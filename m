Hi Enrico,

Yes, you are right in interlaced mode the VD1 interrupt handler
doesn't have to be executed. In v1 there is a conditional execution
and that is why the ISP doesn't hang up.

Could you please try changing this on ispccdc.c with v2 patches?

diff --git a/drivers/media/video/omap3isp/ispccdc.c
b/drivers/media/video/omap3isp/ispccdc.c
index 9b40968..bfd3f46 100644
--- a/drivers/media/video/omap3isp/ispccdc.c
+++ b/drivers/media/video/omap3isp/ispccdc.c
@@ -1658,7 +1658,8 @@ int omap3isp_ccdc_isr(struct isp_ccdc_device
*ccdc, u32 events)
        if (ccdc->state == ISP_PIPELINE_STREAM_STOPPED)
                return 0;

-       if (events & IRQ0STATUS_CCDC_VD1_IRQ)
+       if ((events & IRQ0STATUS_CCDC_VD1_IRQ) &&
+           !ccdc_input_is_fldmode(ccdc))
                ccdc_vd1_isr(ccdc);

        ccdc_lsc_isr(ccdc, events);

With this change the ISP shouldn't hang but I don't know if you will
get the right data.

Best regards,
