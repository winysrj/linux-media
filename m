Hi all

The hard-drive of my mail server died last Sunday and my last back up was 
from Friday evening, so, I lost about 1.5 days worth of mail. I don't 
think I lost anything important: I saw all mails in my INBOX before 
powering down the system to not be able to bring it back up again:-) But 
if anyone thinks, that I missed their mail, please, re-send.

Thanks
Guennadi
