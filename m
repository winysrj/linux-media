We are trying to get something that really works and SOLVES some of the
problems with real devices that require contiguous memory for DMA.

It requires some amount of work but I see no reason why we shouldn't be
able to unmap that pages to stay 100% conformant with ARM spec.

Please notice that there are also use cases where the memory will not be
accessed by the CPU at all (like DMA transfers between multimedia devices
and the system memory).

Go ahead! Remeber to remove dma_coherent because it also breaks the spec. :)
Oh, I forgot. We can also remove all device drivers that might use DMA. :)



Merry Christmas and Happy New Year for everyone! :)
