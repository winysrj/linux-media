That sounds like a bug in those drivers, why not fix them to properly
pass in the correct pointer?

Then they shouldn't be "plain" platform drivers, that should only be
reserved for drivers that are the "lowest" type.  Just make them MFD
devices and go from there.

They shouldn't be "independant", make them "dependant" and go from
there.
