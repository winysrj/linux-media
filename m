Hi,

there is not the slightest reason to do so.

The input layer for video4linux was done by Gerd once, because lirc was
totally unavailable during the 2.6 test kernels (last was 2.6.0-11 ?),
IIRC, and there was totally nothing there at all.

At least it did continue up to something more close to -10 than -0.

How, can someone made lirc a must have on all packaged stuff ?

Not been there?

Nothing against anyone there personally, never met, but how can this
ever be above projects like mplayer, xine, vlc and many others ?

Something is going very wrong.

Cheers,
Hermann
