In some cases, they need the whole cell to clone it. So I'm up for adding an
mfd_cell pointer to the platform_device structure.
Below is a tentative patch. This is a first step and would fix all
regressions. I tried to keep the MFD dependencies as small as possible, which
is why I placed the pdev->mfd_cell building code in mfd-core.c
The second step would be to get rid of mfd_get_data() and have all subdrivers
going back to the regular platform_data way. They would no longer be dependant
on the MFD code except for those who really need it. In that case they could
just call mfd_get_cell() and get full access to their MFD cell.
