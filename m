I'm using here udev-182.

I don't think that putting firmware on initrd is something that we want to
for media drivers. None of the webcam drivers currently need a firmware;
those are required on more complex devices (typically digital TV ones).

While there are a number of PCI devices that require firmware, in practice,
we're seeing more people using USB devices. IMO, it doesn't make any sense
that a hot-pluggable USB device to require a firmware at initrd/initramfs,
with is available only at boot time.

I'll run some tests with this patch applied and see what happens.
