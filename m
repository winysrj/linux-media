i think i need to revive this very old thread.
i ran into some problems with my new dvb box after the old one gave up 
permanently (probably due to worn out flash) and then learned a few things.

apparently i need to use PLP=1 for the dvb-t2 channels to get a lock.
if i use my dvb box and uses plp=0 as is the default it never locks on 
to the t2 frequencies and never finds any of the dvb-t2 channels (= all 
the hd channels)

so as was discussed earlier i think my issue with the new version of 
ct2-4650 is related to plp.

when this thread was going last year i ran into issues i could not solve 
and then gave up since it wasn't too important to have the ct2-4650 working.
but maybe it is time to give this another try.

also last year i had issues loading the media build modules due to an 
extra kernel module that was built that i just had to delete (didn't 
know it back then)



so, two main questions:
how is plp supposed to work? is the drivers supposed to auto detect this?
if so, how do i convince the drivers to use plp=1 when i use for example 
w_scan ?

and secondly, if drivers is supposed to auto detect plp, it clearly 
doesn't happen for me.
since this works on windows, is it possible that the windows driver is 
using a newer firmware for the si6168-b40 than 4.0.25?
(latest one i found on: 
http://palosaari.fi/linux/v4l-dvb/firmware/Si2168/Si2168-B40/)
any advice on how to check or capture what the windows driver uses?

thanks.
