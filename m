The following is a much simpler change that maintains precision and
avoids 64-bit arithmetic.  Moving the division by 1000 and grouping it
with (NSEC_PER_SEC / 1000), an exact integer, avoids the 32-bit overflow
and allows the compiler to optimise the division without losing any
precision.

And, FWIW the following patch fixes RC key input for Nova-S plus,
HVR1100, HVR3000 and HVR4000 in the 2.6.38 kernel.  Apparently a
Hauppauge keymap with system ID code was added in this release but the
cx88 code was not updated when the RC5 decoder changes were made:
