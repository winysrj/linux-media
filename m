Wrong! Hans Verkuil and you tried to do it, without caring that it would
break userspace, and it was NAKed.

Btw, if there is an API conflict, you guys created it.

Anyone, who is interested in the _true_ history, should have a look at
the GIT changelog:
- dvb/{video.h,audio.h,osd.h} was the original decoder API.
- Then Hans extended this API, still using the same files.
- Later the v4l guys decided to create a new API.
- Now they want to (re)move the old one, breaking userspace.

I explicitly NAK any attempt to break userspace applications and tools!
There is no reason to do it!

The driver works fine, and it will continue to do so, unless someone
tampers with it. It does not require maintenance.
The hardware is old, but it is still in use, as it is easy to create a
pc-based settopbox with it.

It you move the API somewhere else, you will break userspace applications
like VDR. This is not acceptable.

As far as I understand the original patchset, it will not break
userspace, as it will simply move all files somewhere else, preserving
file names and the position of the files in the tree.

Mauro is trying to the move the old decoder API somewhere else, possibly
into a different file, which will definitely break userspace.
NAK for this!

Oliver
