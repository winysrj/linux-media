I did see some issues when I did the following sequence:

- blacklisted au0828 and snd-usb-audio was probed first
  graph is good just with audio entities as expected
- modprobed au0828 - graph looks good.
- rmmod au0828 - no problems seen in dmesg
- modprobe au0828 - problems kasan reports bad access etc.
  http://pastebin.com/FFqNzx9G

Here is what's going on after each step:

blacklisted au0828 and snd-usb-audio was probed first
1. snd-usb-audio creates media device and registers it
   Creates its graph etc.
2. modprobed au0828
   au0828 finds the media device created and registered.
   Adds its graph
3. rmmod au0828
   Even though there are no problems reported, at this
   time media device is unregistered, and /dev/mediaX is
   removed. We still have snd_usb-audio and media device.
   As media device is a device resource on usb device parent,
   it will still be there, but no way to access the device
   itself, because it is no longer registered.
4. modprobe au0828
   At this point, au0828 finds the media device as it still
   there, registers it and adds its graph. No audio graph
   present at this time.

Please note that the media device will not be deleted until
the last put on the parent usb struct device. So even when
both snd-usb-audio, and au0828 modules are removed, media
device is still there without its graph and associated devnode
(/dev/mediax is removed).

This isn't bad, however, media_device could still have
stale information.

e.g: enable/disable handlers - when au0828 is removed,
these are no longer valid. Could be cleaned up in
media device unregister just like entity_notify() handler
gets deleted from media device unregister. At the moment,
either driver can call unregister and same cleanup happens.

I will send a patch to do enable/disable handler cleanup
in unregister path.

However, the root of the problem is media device is
still there without its graph and associated devnode
(/dev/mediax is removed) when any one of the drivers
is removed. This leaves the remaining drivers in a
degenerate state.

The problem can be solved with some handshaking at
unregister time. We could add a callback for each
if the drivers to handle media device unregister.
However, that would add delays in device removal path
when all the drivers exit. I think it will be hard to
handle all the corner cases without adding run-time overhead.

Any thoughts on whether we want to unofficially support
being able to remove individual drivers?
