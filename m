[Follow-up post] *Delivery issues resolved, although there's still 
delays of 7hrs or more being investigated with postmasters*

Attention Kernellabs devs,
I've deliberately delayed these two posts as Steve mentioned he wouldn't 
have time to respond for at least 1wk.

It's now been almost two weeks, do you think you might have 5-minutes to 
spare now?
I realise you might not "know" the answer to some of my questions 
yet!...  :-)

All the best,
Jed
