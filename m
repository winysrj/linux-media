Hello Oliver,

I've managed to run Win 7 on the computer. Tested the encrypted channels with
WIndows Media Center and the DigitalDevices driver version 2.1.0.30. I cannot
get the channels to show up. MCE shows an error stating that those channels
are encrypted or there are no signals for them.

FTA works.

Any suggestion from here ?

I've read on the digital devices FAQ that the SMIT viaccess CAM has been
successfully tested...

Thx
