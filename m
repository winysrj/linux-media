I agree with Rob here - I think especially for the coherency discussion
some actual users of dma_buf on a bunch of insane platforms (i915
qualifies here too, because we do some cacheline flushing behind everyones
back) would massively help in clarifying things.

It also sounds like that at least for proper userspace mmap support we'd
need some dma api extensions on at least arm, and that might take a while
...
