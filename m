Hi Rob,

I would agree with you if we were only talking about GPU, but display is 
broader than that. Many hardware available today have complex display 
pipelines with "deep tunneling" between other IP blocks (such as the camera 
subsystem) and the display. Configuration of such pipelines isn't specific to 
DRM/KMS.

I agree that DRM/KMS must be used to address needs specific to display 
hardware, but I don't think *all* display needs are specific to the display.

The MC API has been designed to expose pipeline topologies to userspace. In 
the plane->crtc->encoder->connector case, DRM/KMS is probably enough. However, 
many pipelines can't be described so simply. Reinventing the wheel doesn't 
look like the best solution to me.

That's why I'm not advocating replacing DRM with V4L :-)

As explained in my previous mail, V4L and DRM started as monolithic APIs to 
solve different needs. We now realize that they're actually made (or should be 
made) of several sub-APIs. In the V4L case, that's pipeline discovery, 
pipeline setup, format configuration (at the pad level in the pipeline, 
including cropping, scaling and composing), controls (at the entity and/or pad 
level in the pipeline), memory management and stream control (there are a 
couple of other tasks we can add, but that's the basic idea). Some of those 
tasks need to be performed for display hardware as well, and I believe we 
should standardize a cross-subsystem (DRM, FB and V4L) API there. All the 
display-specific needs that DRM has been designed to handle should continue to 
be handled by DRM, I have no doubt about that.

To summarize my point, I don't want to fit V4L in DRM, but I would like to 
find out which needs are common between V4L and DRM, and see if we can share 
an API there.
