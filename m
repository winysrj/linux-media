Right, and the patch doesn't change that. The bus switch is still done
when configuring register 0x06.

No, the device probing ist still done _after_ register 0x06 (i2c speed
etc.) is configured.
That's why I moved the call to em28xx_do_i2c_scan() from
em28xx_i2c_register() to em28xx_init_dev() (after the register 0x06
configuration).
See the commit message.

Old code:
(device seems to starts up with bus B selected)
- configure EM28XX_R06_I2C_CLK    <=== SWITCHES TO BUS B
- call em28xx_i2c_register()
        - calls i2c_add_adapter() /* adapter registration */
        - calls em28xx_i2c_eeprom() /* read eeprom, calculate hash,
print content */        <=== FAILS, EEPROM IS ON BUS A
        - calls em28xx_do_i2c_scan() /* probes for presence of devices
at known i2c addresses */

New code:
(device seems to starts up with bus B selected)
- clear bit EM2874_I2C_SECONDARY_BUS_SELECT of register
EM28XX_R06_I2C_CLK (only for bridges that support it)        <= SWITCHES
TO BUS A
- call em28xx_i2c_register()
        - calls i2c_add_adapter() /* adapter registration */
        - calls em28xx_i2c_eeprom() /* read eeprom, calculate hash,
print content */
- configure EM28XX_R06_I2C_CLK    <=== SWITCHES TO BUS B
- call em28xx_do_i2c_scan() /* probes for presence of devices at known
i2c addresses */


The new order now is also exactly the same as used by the Windows driver
(mentioned in the commit message, too).

Definitely. :(
We talked about that at the beginning.

I have spent several ours working on this, but finally gave it up (for
now), because
a) it is a very huge change. I started changing/fixing one thing, then I
noticed that this requires fixing 2 other issues first, which again made
it necessary to change others and so on...
The main problem isn't the i2c adapter/bus changes, it's the subdevice
handling/tracking...
b) the resulting code has a big overhead and I'm not sure if it is
justified as long as there is no device yet using both busses in parallel.

Sure, we all like clean code and sooner or later we will likely be
forced to do it properly.
Maybe I will come back to it when the webcam stuff is finished.
But for now (with regards to the eeprom reading), reordering the bus
setup/configuration calls seems to be the easiest and appropriate
solution to me.

Frank
