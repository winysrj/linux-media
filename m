Nothing really "breaks", It's "slow" and it will surely be fixed when
we know what's the right fix, which we haven't sorted out at this
moment.

Not saying that it is right or nice, but it's the kernel itself that
blocks. Run init=/bin/sh and do a modprobe of one of these drivers and
it hangs un-interruptible until the kernel's internal firmware loading
request times out, just because userspace is not there.

No, we used to un-queue events which had a timeout specified in the
environment, that code caused other issues and was removed.

It should not be an issue, the serialization is strictly parent <->
child, everything else runs in parallel.

It is a kind of lock up, just try modprobe with the init=/bin/sh boot.

That's the current idea, and Tom is looking into it how it could look like.

I also have no issues at all if the kernel does load the firmware from
the filesystem on its own; it sounds like the simplest and most robust
solution from a general look at the problem. It would also make the
difference between in-kernel firmware and out-of-kernel firmware less
visible, which sounds good.
Honestly, requiring firmware-loading userspace-transactions to
successfully link a module into the kernel sounds like a pretty bad
idea to start with. Unlike module loading which needs the depmod alias
database and userspace configuration; with firmware loading, there is
no policy involved where userspace would add any single additional
value to that step.

Thanks,
Kay
