Hi all,

There are lot's of discussions, but it can be hard sometimes to actually 
determine someone's opinion.

So here is a quick poll, please reply either to the list or directly to me 
with your yes/no answer and (optional but welcome) a short explanation to 
your standpoint. It doesn't matter if you are a user or developer, I'd like 
to see your opinion regardless.

Please DO NOT reply to the replies, I'll summarize the results in a week's 
time and then we can discuss it further.

Should we drop support for kernels <2.6.22 in our v4l-dvb repository?

_: Yes
_: No

Optional question:

Why:



Thanks,

	Hans
