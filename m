Thanks Mike, I managed to find it finally on Amazon.co.uk which claimed 
that it was available from June 2007!

That might explain why it's not on the Hauppauge website as it is most 
likely getting replaced....

I actually expected this to be one of those cute USB keys but this thing 
resembles a set top box :-)

I think the WinTV HVR-900 maybe a better option as it is supported. I am 
guessing that this is the same thing as the H model without the HD support?

It maybe ok what do you think?? Also you can use this with a remote too 
can't you??
