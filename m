Right. A copy-pasto.

Unless you need more than one PHY in this driver...

Well, such dynamic allocation is a must. We don't accept non-multiplatform 
aware code anymore, not even saying about multiboard.

Yes, technically this can work. You would still have to perform some kind 
of synchronization to make sure that the PHY bound to this structure is 
actually present. This is again technically doable (e.g. a list of 
registered struct phys inside PHY core).

You can't assure this. Board file is free to do whatever it wants with 
this struct. A clean solution would prevent this.

Not really. The phy struct is something that _is_ private data of PHY 
subsystem, not something that can store private data of PHY subsystem 
(sure it can store private data of particular PHY driver, but that's 
another story) and only PHY subsystem should have access to its contents.

By the way, we need to consider other cases here as well, for example it 
would be nice to have a single phy_get() function that works for both non-
DT and DT cases to make the consumer driver not have to worry whether it's 
being probed from DT or not.

I'd suggest simply reusing the lookup method of regulator framework, just 
as I suggested here:
