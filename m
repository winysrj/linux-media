NACK: we need to replace those kmalloc's with kzalloc. This patch will just
fix the internal_ops problem, but sd->entity isn't zeroed. It's going to be
a neverending problem unless we fix those kmalloc's. It is my fault, I guess:
I should always have required the use of kzalloc.

I grepped for this and the number of kmalloc's is quite small:

drivers/media/video/tda9840.c
drivers/media/video/upd64031a.c
drivers/media/video/m52790.c
drivers/media/video/tea6415c.c
drivers/media/video/tea6420.c
drivers/media/video/upd64083.c
drivers/media/radio/saa7706h.c
drivers/media/radio/tef6862.c

If you fix those kmalloc's, then I'll ack those changes. There is just one
relevant kmalloc in each file.

The reason this wasn't noticed before is that all these devices are all
pretty rare. All the more common device drivers use kzalloc. I am really
surprised to hear of mxb boards still in use! Just for the record: I have
one myself for testing, although I clearly never realized that I should
test that particular change with that board...

Thanks for doing such a great job of tracking this down!

	Hans
