Hi,

Sorry to bother you again, but here is the situation:
I have 2 drivers: an ov2640 driver and my atmel driver.
Basically the ov2640 driver is the same as the ov7670 driver.

So what I don't know is how to call the ov2640 functions(such as set 
format) in my atmel driver.

In the ov2640 I used the function: v4l2_i2c_subdev_init, and in the 
atmel driver I used v4l2_device_register.

But I don't know where I should use the v4l2_i2c_new_subdev function, 
and how to link my atmel video struct to the i2c sensor.

Is there any examples in linux?

Regards,
Sedji
