I'm also interested, but, for me, being in US or in Europe requires me some
months in advance for planning.

It is probably hard for me to get budget for 2 international travels per year.
So, except if I can get some sponsor, I probably won't be able to be on the
interim meeting.

I'm planning to be on LPC, so we can schedule the subsystem mini-summit to 
happen in Cambridge, MA, US, in November.

I can also try the same. If there are enough interested people, I may be
able to organize a meeting on Red Hat's office in Sao Paulo, Brazil.
