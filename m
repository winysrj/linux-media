If you say so, I don't know what sets the standard but that seems
kinda backwards.

I'd expect the "flick the switch, expose to userspace" to always be
the last thing, but I'm happy to be shown examples to the contrary.

The only "broken" thing, is as I said - I can apply this patch to a
kernel (any kernel, because there's no dependencies in the code), and
it won't do what the kernel-doc says it will.

Maybe I'm crazy, but shouldn't comments at least be correct at the
point where they are added, even if they become incorrect later
through neglect?
