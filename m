Who do I need to bribe to get you enough time to do this? We bought a 
couple of those Hauppauge cards and still can't use them. I've had 
numerous requests for more of these machines, but I'm not going to sell 
something that won't work. If they're the ones not giving you enough 
time, I'd be happy to call and complain.
