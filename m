As far as I can recall, the only constraint is the USB host controller
isochronous bandwidth.
Given the stk1160 chip streams raw video, and given I have found no
way to implement frame size in-chip reduction,
your USB host must be able to deal with raw full frames. Roughly
speaking you need as much as 20 MB/s for each stk1160 video input.

Such throughput is more or less close, to USB2.0 maximum throughput.

I hope someone can jump in and correct me if I'm wrong here.

I think this is a hardware limitation. The stk1160 is not able to
capture from the multiple channels
simultaneously. I honestly don't recall how it performs when fast
switching between channels, but I wouldn't expect much.

Maybe you can get yourself a video capture device that can stream
compressed video? That will certainly reduce the USB bandwidth
requirement.

Hope this helps!
