Oh right, now I understand. Somehow I've always thought we already take
care of this case, since I remember discussing it.

To fix that we need a device-global import cache similar to how we already
have one for each file_priv. I think we can reuse the same locking and
refcounting scheme, but I haven't checked. The commit messages of the past
few prime changes have fairly good explanations of the tricky stuff going
on there.

Sorry for being dense for so long, I should have checked my idea of what
the drm prime code does with reality sooner ;-)

Cheers, Daniel
