I did not follow all the thread, but I was wondering about an other
solution: what about offering both USB mass storage and webcam accesses?

When a dual-mode webcam is plugged in, the driver creates two devices,
the video device /dev/videox and the volume /dev/sdx. When the webcam is
opened, the volume cannot be mounted. When the volume is mounted, the
webcam cannot be opened. There is no need for a specific API. As Mauro
said:

That's all. By where am I wrong?
