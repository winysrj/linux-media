Hi Ezequiel,

Thanks for your offering.

There are 400+ patches pending today at patchwork. I doubt I'll have enough
time for all of them, so, I'll skip cleanup patches like the above, in order
to try to focus on bug fixes and patches that brings new functionality to
existing code and with a low risk of breaking anything.

Next year, we'll start implementing the sub-maintainers, and, with their
help, I suspect we'll be able to finally apply those patches.

If you want us to help, feel free to review/test the individual patches
submitted by non-maintainers to the ML. We tend to apply faster patches
that are more reviewed. 

Hmm... well, actually it is just the opposite: we explicitly delay 
not-reviewed patches for unmaintained/bad maintained drivers,
to see if someone acks or nacks them after testing.

Regards,
Mauro
