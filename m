Yes I agree.

How are we going to address use case highlighted by Mark R, like N
Connections on a single IP block?

This use-case can not be addressed with tx-mode and rx-mode or
tx-proto-stack/rx-proto-stack properties.

So the idea of generic properties for tx and rx sounds incorrect.

IMHO, Best thing would be to drop the idea of using tx-mode and rx-mode
as generic properties and use "st,tx-mode" and "st,rx-mode" instead for
st-rc driver.

What do you think?
