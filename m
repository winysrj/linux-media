Mauro, just because code luckily 'works' in the current constellation,
it isn't necessarily good code.
It's this kind of issues that can easily cause regressions if the code
changes somewhere else.

em28xx-input registers the i2c device, so it should unregister it on
uninit/close/unload, too.
Pretty simple and easy to fix (+5 - 2 = 3 additional lines of code).

I'm talking about em28xx-input and the RC part only. Of course not the
whole driver.
Do you really want to load module ir-kbd-i2c even though there is no
device ?

You can check the success of request_module.

The whole thing is really easy to fix, I fail to see why you don't want
to do it.

... which is exactly what made it so easy to cause this regression !!!

It's not obvious for programmers that no RC map has to be specified for
i2c RCs in the board data.
It's also not obvious that em28xx-input silently overwrites the rc-map
assigned at board level.
In general, it's not obvious that two completely different code areas
have to be touched for these devices.
That's why we really should avoid those board specific code parts spread
all over the driver as much as possible.
In case of the RC map it's really easy.

I also fail to see what you would loose in em28xx-input. We would still
assign the RC map to dev->init_data.
If you prefer seeing the used RC map in the em28xx-input code directly,
then the same should apply for devices with built-in IR
recceiver/decoder (which means moving all rc-map assignments to
em28xx-input).
You could also get rid of field ir_codes this way.

Different case.
Avoiding board specific code parts there likely isn't possible (and
reasonable), although it should be the goal.

Coming soon.

Yes, this is indeed more a theoretical thing.
I think good code should have such a warning, but that's also matter of
taste.
Talking about code bloating seems a bit exaggerated to me, we are
talking about 1 or 2 extra lines of code.

Yepp, and that's the responsibility of the driver. em28xx-input and not
ir-kbd-i2c !
The driver that supplies the key polling functions.

Mauro,
I would like to repeat what I've already said above: just because code
'works' in a specific constellation, it isn't necessarily good code.
The fact that this code has been suffering from a big fat regression for
a long time should really draw our attention !
So let's try to avoid this happening again by fixing the issues the code
has, so that it becomes much more robust.
I'm offering to send patches.

Regards,
Frank
