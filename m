I am planning to buy a new system and want to be able to record video 
(from a camera, using a composite signal).

I am considering a Intel Core 2 Duo E8200 processor running Fedora 9 and 
a KWorld PVR_TV 7131 TV Tuner card.

The card has many features that I don't need - (Remote Control, 
Scheduled recording in the Power off mode, Sleep timer etc.) - but does 
include Composite Input.   Where can I look to verify that I will (or 
won't) be able to use this card as I wish.  Is it supported?

Thanks in Advance
