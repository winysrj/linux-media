Stop this crazy. FIX UDEV ALREADY, DAMMIT.

Who maintains udev these days? Is it Lennart/Kai, as part of systemd?

Lennart/Kai, fix the udev regression already. Lennart was the one who
brought up kernel ABI regressions at some conference, and if you now
you have the *gall* to break udev in an incompatible manner that
requires basically impossible kernel changes for the kernel to "fix"
the udev interface, I don't know what to say.

"Two-faced lying weasel" would be the most polite thing I could say.
But it almost certainly will involve a lot of cursing.

The fact is, udev made new - and insane - rules that are simply
*invalid*. Modern udev is broken, and needs to be fixed.

I don't know where the problem started in udev, but the report I saw
was that udev175 was fine, and udev182 was broken, and would deadlock
if module_init() did a request_firmware(). That kind of nested
behavior is absolutely *required* to work, in order to not cause
idiotic problems for the kernel for no good reason.

What kind of insane udev maintainership do we have? And can we fix it?

Greg, I think you need to step up here too. You were the one who let
udev go. If the new maintainers are causing problems, they need to be
fixed some way.
