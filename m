I can't read my xs4all.nl email at the moment, I suspect that port forwarding on my router
is broken. Of course, it happens just as I am abroad. So until Tuesday CC important emails
also to my work email: hans.verkuil@cisco.com.

Note that emails to xs4all.nl aren't lost, I just can't access them at the moment.

Regards,

	Hans
