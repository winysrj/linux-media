Yeah, this is a known misfeature of bttv, and very likely documented on
several wiki pages like those:
	http://linuxtv.org/wiki/index.php/Remote_controllers-V4L
(btw, this wiki page is very likely outdated)
	http://www.mythtv.org/wiki/Ir-kbd-i2c
	http://www.linuxtv.org/wiki/index.php/Prolink_Pixelview_PlayTV_Pro

I can't remember if this were always this way, or if this was
caused by the I2C core redesign (2006?). I think it was always like that,
and, as I2C comes with a cost (polling can affect video processing with
old machines), so, we decided to not do the auto-load on the older
drivers that weren't doing it already.

Btw, the fact that there's no clear indication about what bttv boards
require I2C made hard to remove the get_key codes from ir-kbd-i2c.

It probably makes sense to add a "has_ir_i2c" field at bttv, add a flag
there at modprobe to prevent the autoload, and start tagging the boards
with I2C IR with such tag.

If you care enough, feel free to send us such patch.

Cheers,
Mauro
