Hi Mauro,

I would like to personally thank you for spending time on git support at 
linuxtv.org. Git support was a long-awaited feature for many developers (and I 
certainly was one of them).

All the work done behind the scene on linuxtv.org isn't seen by end-users and 
can thus be less rewarding than working on the code. However, it's of critical 
importance to make the development process as smooth as possible. For that 
reason, thank you again.

Thanks to Douglas too for agreeing to manage backports. Getting the latest 
version of our drivers working on older kernels make the test base much 
larger, leading to better quality code (or at least to more bug reports :-)).

Laurent Pinchart
