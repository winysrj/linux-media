I'm going to be blunt about something -- you're not being particularly 
helpful to yourself or the list:
- To yourself because you're not being very efficient.
- To the list because you're breeching etiquette.

Here are a few tips:

1 - instead of breaking threading, and opposed to having a zillion 
different threads essentially all about the same things, keep your 
content within one i.e. the original message ... having a contiguous 
thread will also help those who may, in future, search the lists for 
similar problems

2 - entitle your threads appropriately  -- i.e. "another very basic 
question ... " or "the final inch" are not very helpful  .... the last 
one in particular, given the thousand or so emails I receive each week 
from China, Russia etc etc regarding viagra, penis enlargement etc etc 
etc ... if your goal is to get/reach those who are most capable of 
helping you, you're certainly going about it the wrong way ... (i) busy 
people will browse over items that don't seem interesting or appear on 
the surface to possibly be spam  and (ii) please don't ambiguious 
messages  as it just ends up wasting others time in trying to figure out 
what your question is/relates too (i.e. perfect example: Merc trying to 
figure out what you were talking about in this thread)

3 - a number of the "basic questions" you have posed are readily 
answered in the wikis ... so, in posting here about these elementary 
issues,  you've wasted your and my (and others) time too ...
- your time because you likely could have read about the solutions 
quicker then you typed/enquired about them
- my and others time because we've already spent considerable time 
trying to document such elementary questions in the wiki ... and my time 
again in having to compose this message to draw light to this fact

4 - please don't top post
