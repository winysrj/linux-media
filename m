I complained about configfs before, but you didn't listen.

The igb hacks show that you are on the wrong track.  We can and should
be able to support TSN without resorting to driver specific hacks and
module parameters.

As I said before about V1, this architecture stinks.  You appear to
have continued hacking along and posted the same design again.  Did
you even address any of the points I raised back then?

You are trying to put tons of code into the kernel that really belongs
in user space, and at the same time, you omit critical functions that
only the kernel can provide.

And which driver is that?

Thanks,
