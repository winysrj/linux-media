I have the good fortune to be the 'lucky' owner of an stb0899/stb6100 based 
DVB card. 

Whilst the performance of the card is fine, at least as good as the two other 
s1 TT cards I have, I find it really frustrating that I can't use it in the 
way that I can the other two.


I use them, together with the femon and rotor plugins, to tune up my roof 
mounted dishes. with the s1 cards I can see that I am getting closer from the 
displays, but with the s2...................................... nothing.

I have been keeping my eye on the list for ages hoping that there will be some 
advancement in this area and although there was quite some discussion in 
March about the right way to interpret these stats., that dried up at the end 
of March with nothing further since.

I am only a User having no development skills so can't help in that area
but I do know that I want measurements that get bigger as dish alignment gets 
better. I really don't give a knack what units are used.

I don't want to start world war 3 ( or even another interminable and seemingly 
fruitless discussion ) but can someone in the development team tell me what 
is being done, if anything, to incorporate SNR SS and BER in STB0899/STB6100 
drivers. Lets face it these drivers have been around for quite some time and 
my guess would be that Technotrend cards represent a fair proportion of the 
total out there.

Regards


Mike
