Any "hint" code that would try to do some NOP operations may fail. One of the
reasons is that such hint is not documented. Yet, I don't officially support
such "hint" methods at the API.

Well, a V4L1 call now returns -ENOTTY, with the current behaviour. 

Btw, there are two drivers returning -ENOTTY, when the device got disconnected
(or firmware were not uploaded).

The truth is that the current API specs for return code is bogus.

The V4L2 spec needs to be fixed with respect to error codes. Driver authors
are much more creative than DocBook authors ;) There are a lot of return
codes used by the drivers whose API spec doesn't mention (and, on this subject, 
the same applies to the DVB API). What I've seen is that:
- Sometimes, a core return code is returned. One of the important examples is
  the ENOSPC error returned when the usb core refuses to stream when the USB
  bus reached 80% of the available bandwidth. There's a patch floating around that
  would allow to override the 80% hard limit, via sysfs. So, if properly documented,
  an userspace application could give a hint that the user needs to either use a
  different bus or try to change the hard limit;
- For every ioctl, it presents its own "private" list of error codes. If someone wants
  to add a new code (for example, standardizing ENOTTY or ENOSPC), all affected
  ioctl's will need to be touched. This is hard to maintain;
- Drivers are not compliant with error codes.

The right thing to do is to create a separate chapter for error codes, based on errno(3)
man page, where we document all error codes that should be used by the drivers. Then,
at the ioctl pages, link to the common chapter and, only when needed, document special
cases where an error code for that specific ioctl has some special meaning.

I ran a script here to check how many different error codes are used inside drivers/media:

$ find drivers/media -type f -name '*.[ch]'  >files
$ grep define `find . -name errno*.h`|perl -ne 'print "$1\n" if (/\#define\s+(E[^\s]+)/)'|sort|uniq >errors
$ for i in `cat errors`; do COUNT=$(git grep -c $i `cat files`|wc -l); if [ "$COUNT" != "0" ]; then echo $i $COUNT; fi; done

The result is that we're using 53 different types of errors, but the API specs documents
only 17 of them. Those are the currently used errors at drivers/media:

I suspect that we'll need to both fix some drivers, and the API, as I bet that
the same error conditions are reported differently on different drivers.

As I said, the current API is bogus with respect to error codes. Of course,
we need to do take care to avoid userspace applications breakage, but we can't
use the excuse that it is there for a long time as a reason for not fixing it.
