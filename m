Okay, fair enough. Please include some of this explanation in the
binding description.

I do still have some concerns about led-sources and whether it can
support other scenarios. It is very much tied to the parent node. Are
there any cases where we don't want the LEDs to be sub nodes? Perhaps
the LEDs are on a separate daughterboard from the driver/supply and we
can have different drivers. It's a stretch maybe. Or are there cases
where you need more information than just the connection?
