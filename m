Dear all ~
     I have to implement the hal in Android with v4l2. Now i use one
thread to preview , i just use V4L2 capture interface to implement the
preview. Now i have one confusion : 
     I think i can implement the taking picture just copy the preview
frame , and  am i right ? I want to use another thread to take picture ,
when I am taking picture ,whether I have to stop the previewing ?
     Thanks a lot ~!~
