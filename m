Thanks for the info.  I just skimmed Documentation/sound/alsa/timestamping.txt.

That is fairly new, only since v4.1.  Are then any apps in the wild
that I can look at?  AFAICT, OpenAVB, gstreamer, etc, don't use the
new API.

Documentation/sound/alsa/timestamping.txt says:

  If supported in hardware, the absolute link time could also be used
  to define a precise start time (patches WIP)

Two questions:

1. Where are the patches?  (If some are coming, I would appreciate
   being on CC!)

2. Can you mention specific HW that would support this?


Thanks,
Richard
