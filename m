Personally I would like to have a working PCI DVB-C card with CI here in
Finland so I could watch encrypted channels. My current Terratec Cinergy
(mantis, VP-2040 clone) gives me CAM menu but locks computer shortly
thereafter. There aren't many different cards available and information
about whether they actually work is even more rare.

I wonder would it be possible to have some sort of compatibility testing
project (with help of some companies to get the hardware). Just test
different cards/USB-sticks and see how well they work, are drivers
available on current kernel, any hacks needed etc.
