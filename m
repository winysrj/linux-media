Hi Andreas

Exactly that was an intention for my first RFC - to get driver reviewed by
kernel hackers and enhance/fixe it to prepare it for merging.

I'm going to address all your findings during Xmass, so hopefully I will
spam here again after New Year :-)

I very appreciate your POV which helped me stay remembering
it is not way to the wall.

Thanks
