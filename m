Hi Douglas,

Thanks for the response. I know how to deal with hg. Now that there is
a transition to git, I would like to learn how to achieve the same
results. Access to building new drivers with the same running kernel.
My concern is that I have 2 device types (HVR-1600 and HD-PVR) and one
of the devs has submitted their latest bits via git and I didn't see
it ported over to the hg tree. While I realize everything takes time -
I thought I would check into git and see if I could deal with it.

When development moves to git, how do I replace that ability?

Thanks,

Brandon
