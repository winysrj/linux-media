This is a repost from earlier.  I didn't see this E-mail show up on the 
maillist:


Hello,

I saw some old posts on this maillist about someone trying to get some 
information on a Linux Avermedia A312 driver  around Nov., 2008.  I'm 
just wondering if any progress has been made towards this driver.

I'm interested since I do have a USB Avermedia A312 (ATSC capable) card 
in my HP laptop, and I'd like to get it playing on my machine.

Also, I do know how to program and could probably help out on 
development on this driver as long as I have a starting point to program 
with.  Send me an E-mail if I can help.

Thanks,
--Spicerun
