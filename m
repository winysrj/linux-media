I said 'i2c device', not i2c address. That would definitely be wrong. I'm also
not saying that each i2c device (chip) maps always to one entity, although this
is generally true. In the end it depends on the driver author to decide how
to split up the functionality of the device into entities. There is no hard
and fast rule for that.

Perhaps, perhaps not. There is in the general case no clear rule at what
level you design your entities. In a complex pipeline it would be madness
to map every little HW block to an entity since you would get a zillion
entities, which is highly impractical. The cx25840 combines multiple
functions (tuner, audio/video decoders), and I am not at all sure you
would gain anything from splitting that up into smaller entities. In the
end, if you would write a block diagram of your board the cx25840 would be
a single block. And experience has shown that that is typically the right
level for deciding what will be an entity or not.

Also, in such devices the various functions are often intertwined and
generally not easy to separate.

I agree. MEDIA_ENT_T_V4L2_SUBDEV_SENSOR basically contains two bits of
information: the linux API used to access the entity and the function.

Since you don't combine multiple APIs (e.g. ALSA and V4L2) for a single
device node (I would certainly never allow such code in the kernel!) there
is only one of those, but one entity can certainly combine multiple functions
as I argued for above. Hence, those should be properties.

Anyway, let's wait what Laurent thinks and setup an irc session for this.
