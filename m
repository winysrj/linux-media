Bear in mind that this may not actually be the same product.  Many of
these vendors release multiple products with the same name.  Hence the
"EyeTV One" sold in the Netherlands may be different than the one that
started this thread.  This is especially likely since your product has
a smartcard reader (and I don't think Tim's product does).
