I don't care about this driver, but I mean yes.  That's the point of
linux-next.

I would say the standard rule is that it should sit in linux-next
for a week.  If I submitted a one line bugfix, normally that sits in
linux-next for a week before going upstream.

What frustrates me is that last merge window someone merged a driver
into linux-next for one day.  I submitted a memory corruption fix
the very next day but the maintainer said my fix arrived too late
for the 3.7 release.  What's the point of sending it to linux-next
if you don't have time to take feedback?  So yes, this thread is
mostly me still being cross about that.  :P

We were all expecting Linus to release the kernel last week so no
one should have expected to merge new drivers this week anyway.
