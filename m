Hello again.

And thanks for the comments.

It the first patch I'm kind of suggesting a couple of additions to the
general interface: signal level stuff in the hw seek struct and then a 
function / IOCTL for asking for minimum and maximum for the level.

There are many changes I'll follow by commenting to Hans's comments:

Region is relevant for receiving only. Now I've changes the naming to "band"
because TI uses that in their latest document version.

>> 2. WL1273_CID_FM_SEEK_SPACING: defines what resolution is used when scanning

I've added spacing to the hw seek struct.

>> 3. WL1273_CID_FM_RDS_CTRL for turning on and off the RDS reception / 
>> transmission. To me this seems like a useful standard control...

I did this.

>> channels when doing automatic scan. This could be useful for fine tuning

I've added this as well. The unit is some kind of dB value: "8 bit signed
number in 2Ã¢s complement format Each LSB = 1.5051 dBuV". I also added min
and max values for the level.

Yes the radio can only transmit or receive at a time. And the states are:
On (RX or TX), Off and Suspended. In the suspended mode that firmware patch
is kept in the memory and it doesn't need to get uploaded again when operation
resumes.

I added this...

Yes that can be done. Also volume control could be used. But also there's
nothing to put the radio to stand-by (suspension).

OK, that's fine by me

>This probably should be discussed a bit more.

Ok.

There's also two "new" things. The chip supports in addition to the normal
HW seek a HW block seek, which finds all receivable channels at once. And
then there's  a RSSI block scan that be used in both RX and TX modes to find
transmitting radio stations. Should we try to get these also into the
general interface?

Cheers,
Matti
