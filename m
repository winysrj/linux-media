Android sync is designed not to allow userspace to deadlock the
kernel, a sync_pt should only get created by the kernel when it has
received a chunk of work that it expects to complete in the near
future.  The CONFIG_SW_SYNC_USER driver violates that by allowing
userspace to create and signal arbitrary sync points, but that is
intended only for testing sync.

Timestamps are necessary for vsync synchronization to reduce the frame latency.

As far as I know, every SoC vendor that supports android is using sync
now, but none of them have succeeded in pushing their drivers upstream
for a variety of other reasons (interfaces only used by closed source
userspaces, KMS/DRM vs ADF, ION, etc.).

As long as that doesn't involve removing the Android sync interfaces
from staging until dma fence fds are supported, that's fine with me.
