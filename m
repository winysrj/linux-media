Hi everyone


My remote which used to work with older versions of ubuntu now wont
work with the new natty 11.04.

It used to be detected in /proc/bus/input/devices as input 5 but now i
see no such entry.

Is it because of move from hal to udev in new ubuntu .

Please let me know what info you require.I have filed a bug on
launchpad also.
https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/udev/+bug/748284


Any help is appreciated.


warm regards

rajeev
