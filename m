I just a quick look at the patch series, but I have a few generic
comments:

1) Why are you commenting things on patch 0/0, instead of adding a better description
inside each patch? Some patches deserve descriptions, like this one "v4l2-ioctl.c: finalize table conversion."
The description says nothing, and it seems that it does more than just "Remove the last part of the switch"
as said above.

2) The check you're using to know if an ioctl exists is:

1948 bool v4l2_is_known_ioctl(unsigned int cmd)
1949 {
1950         if (_IOC_NR(cmd) >= V4L2_IOCTLS)
1951                 return false;
1952         return v4l2_ioctls[_IOC_NR(cmd)].ioctl == cmd;
1953 }

That assumes that: 
	a) there's just one ioctl using the same number.
	b) all ioctl's using numbers from 0 to ARRAY_SIZE(v4l2_ioctls) are valid;

With regards to (a), an ioctl code is given not only by its number, but also by
its size, it could be possible that two ioctls would share the same number,
but having different sizes.

Subsystems like input use that for some things: there, GET/SET ioctl's share
the same number (with different read/write flags). Also, different versions
of an ioctl uses different struct sizes.

We currently don't use this way (although it migh be required in the future, if we
need to extend some ioctl out of the current reserved range). So, it may be
interesting to add some note there about the current restriction added by this
patchset.

With regards to (b), this is more serious, as, if an ioctl number is not used, the
code may be doing wrong things (and even OOPSing). 

There are actually some unused numbers: 3, 6, 7, ... Also, as time goes by, ioctl's
can be deprecated and removed (like VIDIOC_G_JPEGCOMP/VIDIOC_S_JPEGCOMP). So,
it is important to actually look inside one of the ioctl fields, to check if the table
entry is really filled.

3) it would be interesting if you could benchmark the previous code and the new
one, to see what gains this change introduced, in terms of v4l2-core footprint and
performance.

Mauro
