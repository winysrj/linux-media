I think I've applied your series yesterday. Yet, patchwork is currently at bad mood, and it is
not allowing to mark your patches as applied (and the previous series as superseded).

I suspect that I'll need to completely abandon patchwork and work on a new way for handling it
that doesn't depend (nor will update) patchwork.kernel.org.
