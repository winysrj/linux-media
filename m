Actually I'd like to see those flash fault code defined in LED
subsystem. And V4L2 will just include LED flash header file to use it.
Because flash fault code is not for V4L2 specific but it's a feature
of LED flash devices.

For clearing error code of flash devices, I think it depends on the
hardware. If most of our LED flash is using reading to clear error
code, we probably can make it simple as this now. But what if some
other LED flash devices are using writing to clear error code? we
should provide a API to that?
