Hi All,

I've been working on and off on the new v4l-utils git repo.

I've just pushed my latest work, some restructuring of the
files under the utils dir, and I've replaced the old Makefiles
which were meant for compilation inside the v4l-dvb hg tree
with new ones which work for standalone compilation.

I've ended up with including copies of a few recent kernel
headers as that indeed was the easiest way.

I'm using plane (GNU) make for now, as that seems to work
very well and I very much like the clean and simple Makefiles
this has resulted in (as opposed to the zillion line
makefiles generated by autotools). And yes the Makefiles
take into account that libsysfs and / or qt might not
be installed and do not build the relevant bits when they
are missing.

Regards,

Hans
