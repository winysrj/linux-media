I can see you ask the other way round, but just in case, I don't have
that bug neither on some self compiled 2.6.30 with recent mercurial
v4l-dvb on some outdated Fedora nor on a 

Linux localhost.localdomain 2.6.30.5-43.fc11.x86_64 #1 SMP Thu Aug 27
21:39:52 EDT 2009 x86_64 x86_64 x86_64 GNU/Linux

with my recently purchased older Pinnacle 310i.

Hm, there are different versions of that card, to have it mentioned,
obviously also with different remotes, and I can't tell how to identify
them.
