Hi Kieran,

You could have inlined this in uvc_queue_buffer_complete(), but the above 
documentation is useful, so I'm fine if you prefer keeping it as a separate 
function. Maybe you could call it uvc_queue_buffer_requeue() to be consistent 
with the other functions ?

This changes the behaviour of the driver. Currently when an erroneous buffer 
is encountered, it will be immediately reused. With this patch applied it will 
be pushed to the back of the queue for later reuse. This will result in 
buffers being reordered, possibly causing issues later when we'll implement 
fences support (or possibly even today).

I think the whole drop corrupted buffers mechanism was a bad idea in the first 
place and I'd like to remove it at some point, buffers in the error state 
should be handled by applications. However, until that's done, I wonder 
whether it would be possible to keep the current order. I unfortunately don't 
see an easy option to do so at the moment, but maybe you would. Otherwise I 
suppose we'll have to leave it as is.

I'm tempted to flip the driver to not drop corrupted buffers by default. I've 
done so on my computer, I'll see if I run into any issue. It could be useful 
if you could set the nodrop parameter to 1 on your systems too when performing 
tests.

Please capitalize the first word to match other comments in the driver.

No need for the extern keyboard. I'll submit a patch to drop it for all 
functions.
