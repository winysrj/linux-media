Coming in mid topic...

I've seen this split bank allocation in Qualcomm and TI SoCs, with
Samsung, that makes 3 major SoC vendors (I would be surprised if
Nvidia didn't also need to do this) - so I think some configurable
method to control allocations is necessarily. The chips can't do
decode without it (and by can't do I mean 1080P and higher decode is
not functionally useful). Far from special, this would appear to be
the default.
