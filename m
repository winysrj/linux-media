Hello all,

I'm new on media and camera, I try to use the OMAP3 ISP driver on
OMAP3530 with media framework. I've a TVP5151 connected on ISP port
though the parallel interface on own custom board

   Against which repository/branch should I start the development ?
   Should I port tvp5150 driver to new tvp5151 device and new media
framework ? Any driver as reference ?

Hopefully, somebody can give me some tips. Thanks

Thanks in advance,
   Enric
