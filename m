OK.  Deleting 200 completely useless lines of code is nothing?  I don't
think we live in the same world.

Right.  And every single USB hard drive out there should have it's own
duplicated usb-storage driver?  I don't think so...

I am sure you are right that the cards are different.  It just doesn't
matter as long as the drivers are identical.

Thank you Mauro for doing this long awaited cleanup.  Getting rid of all
the duplicated and unused code in this driver will make it easier for
others to get involved in fixing the real bugs.
