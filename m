My Dvico HDTV Dual Digital 4 (PCI and confirmed Rev2) works perfectly.  
No problems at all.

I also have 3 x Dvico HDTV Dual Digital Express (PCI Express dual  
hybrid). It is the card with poor tuner performance. I know of some  
people getting good results with the card, but I am guessing that it  
could be related to where on the RF side that the channels are  
transmitting. I have a friend in Canberra with the same card, and he  
has very similar problems to me.

I'm just not sure where to go from here, as I know it isn't a faulty  
card (works in Vista), I know it isn't a faulty antenna installation  
(Works with my dual digital 4 and various Hauppauge cards).
