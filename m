Thanks Steve. Sorry for the slow reply. I'm doing this in my limited 
spare time.

Patches to follow. Nothing exciting. Just trying to make the code more 
robust. Patches are very granular. Let me know if that doesn't work for you.

Knowing the driver works on the nova-s-usb2 would be encouraging. I'm 
trying to get it to work on an hvr-900h.
