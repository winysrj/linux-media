    Hello,
    Does anyone know if there is a driver for this cheap USB DVB-S 
device?  It's only $35 USD on Ebay.  I didn't find any info with Google.

Model Name: DM04+  (or sometimes listed as DM04)
Manufacturer: Forwardvideo (HK) Co., Ltd.
Manufacturer Ref.: EQZ2SH5473Y6
Pictures & Specs:

For sale on Ebay ($35 USD):

    This product is also being sold on ebay with the moniker "T-4".  By 
looking at the paper manual in the picture, one can see that it is 
really the DM04+:

    Beware: there is another "DM04" product from China which looks 
different. 

Model Name: DM04
Manufacturer: Shenzhen Forward Video Co., Ltd.
Pictures & Specs:

    I think this may have been an older version of the DM04+, because 
instead of "Recommends WinXP" it says "IBM PC Compatible: Pentium III 
667MHz, with 128 MB RAM".  Perhaps the "+" (plus) indicates the newer 
version of the product.  Also, note the company name is roughly the same 
for both products ("Forward Video").

    Any help or info is greatly appreciated.


Thanks,
Derek Simkowiak
