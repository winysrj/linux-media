Yes, please do that. It's too bad that never made it into the kernel, so let's
do it now.

So take the controls that you can use from that patch and leave out those that
do not apply to your driver. From the remaining controls not covered by that
patch you will have to decide which are truly chip-specific and which are
valid for any advanced radio receiver.

The really chip(set) specific controls should be put in their own header,
but add the base control ID to v4l2-controls.h (see for example the way that
is done for the MEYE controls).

If you can do that quickly and post a v5, then I will do my best to review
it this week or Monday at the latest. Let's finish this driver asap.

Regards,

	Hans
