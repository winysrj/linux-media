Hi Hans,

As you may see in Jose Alberto's message, the problem occurs with
640x480 and, yes, the image bottom is lacking, but also the right side.

I did not lose your patch, but I did not apply it because most of the
time, the webcams work in the best resolution (VGA) and the associated
problem has not found yet a good resolution...

Regards.
