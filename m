well, as new pads will require new Kernel patches, nothing prevents to add
a new #define. A string would also work.

Well, that's one way, to just quickly express what I meant to say ;)

It is possible to avoid that using other data representations on
userspace, like having a get_field() macro that would return zero
if trying to access past the length.

I guess you meant to say that it can be merged with ID. Yes, agreed.

Either that or we'll have an array of pointers, or, as suggested during
the MC, offsets that will be converted into pointers with something like:

	obj[4] += obj_base;

Well, we currently have 80+ ioctls at V4L2, and it is still usable.

And, from your own suggestions: connectors

I agree that 30 sounds a good number, but the thing is: it is hard to
tell that in advance. As we add support for other subsystems like IIO,
different needs could popup.

For example, if I remember well, on IIO, PADs aren't needed. So we
may end by having some pad-less type of entity to fulfill its
needs.

The thing is: APIs generally start simple, but tend to grow as new
needs happen. See the crop/scaler thing... every time we discuss that,
new proposals to extend the API by creating a new ioctl or a new
type of crop that we didn't foresee in the past discussions.

Using a single ioctl to pack different things will always require some
unpacking/parsing effort on the other side, whatever approach we take.

That's why I think we should have a way to report topology changes as
well.
