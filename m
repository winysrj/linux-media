Since there has been no answer to your question for some time, I think I
will step in.
>From http://mcentral.de/wiki/index.php5/Terratec_HTC_XS , the future for
a driver from Markus for this device does seem to look quite bleak.
However, from looking in the mailinglist archive I gather that Steven
Toth has offered to try getting it to work if someone is willing to
provide him with a device.
Maybe you two could get in contact.
I myself am also interested in a driver for this device but I haven't
got one yet.

Kind regards,

Alain
