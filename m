Hans, I don't have the bandwidth to go through a long discussion in
which probably nobody is really interested.
So please just drop the last two patches which are related to the
V4L2_CID_GREEN_BALANCE issue.
I documented the registers and behavior of the Windows driver, so if you
one day come to the conclusion that such a control would be usefull, it
can be added easily at any time later.

But I would really like to see the first two patches getting applied for
3.7.
The first one is a documentation fix, the second one clearly improves
the behavior of the red and blue balance control (as explained above).
I will resend both patches.


Regards,
Frank
