Thanks, Keith, although I am familiar with the link and the resources
linked to there.

The way I read it, it appeared that the PVR-150 "just works" and as such
should be a safe bet.

So another way of putting my question is really whether the HVR-1300
would work equally well (since it is roughly the same price here, and
appears to support also DVB-T)?

>From the resources linked, it appears to not yet have MPEG encoder support.

However, from earlier mails here and elsewhere, it appears that some
people may have MPEG HW encoder support working -- but  additionally,
some are reporting problems with it under MythTV, so I was hence
wondering which is it...

Is the HVR-1300 MPEG encoder HW support in place now? Do a lot/at least
some have it working well in their setup, using either Analog or DVB-T?

Thanks again for your reply,


-- Per.
