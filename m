Wrong! For the user who does not look behind the curtain (and the majority of 
them do not) the recommended solution wins. The essence of the recommendation 
is the decisive point, nothing else.

Nonsense! How can you talk about "public development" if the majority of 
developers is forced to sign non-disclosure agreements as a necessary 
precondition to get access to data sheets?

Dream on baby, I'm sure tomorrow you will tell us all that pigs can fly :)
The majority is still MS, and you and I won't change that - unfortunately.

Who gives you the right to say that to anybody?
You should perhaps take some lessons about the philosophical basics of open 
source @ Mister Richard Stallman:
There you will learn what "freedom" in the deeper sense of open source means:
It does not mean "free beer". But in fact it is equivalent to "free speech".

And this equivalent to "freedom of speech" definitely excludes fascistoid small 
brained gestures like "I am the boss" or "You are not allowed to speak in that 
forum" and other Machoist stupid omnipotence phantasies of that rather poor 
and primitive no brain kind.

I'd call that fascist crap.

And to teach you, Chehab, (and of course all your brothers and sisters in 
mind) in how far you are a wrong and a completely displaced person I will give 
you a citation of John Lennon from 1966.
It treats the difference of the pure idea of "christian religion" and small 
brained human hypocritic practice on the other hand:

"Jesus was alright, but his disciples were nothing but thick and ordinary.
It's them twisting it that ruins it for me."

Available here: http://quotationsbook.com/quote/21607/

So everyone reading that who can really think further without external 
leadership (following the studies of Immanuel Kant) will easily understand in 
how far Markus' decision to quit linuxtv.org was NOT a pure technical one.

To make open source a real fun and pleasure we need large minded, real 
liberal, progressive thinking maintainers, NOT blind functioning brain-washed 
soldiers of the rather disgusting primitive fascistoid kind.
