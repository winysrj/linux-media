I only tested on 32-bit, both ARM and x86, but had a longer set of patches
applied below.

No strong reason. I went back and forth a bit on the m.offset field that
is part of a union: In a previous version, I planned to move all the
compat handling here, and doing the conversion one field at a time would
make it easier to share the code between 32-bit and 64-bit kernels
handling old 32-bit user space. This version doesn't do that, so I can
use the memcpy approach instead.

Ah, I see. No idea why that did not cause a compile-time error. I got some
errors for duplicate 'case' values when the structures are the same size
(that's why we need the '#ifdef CONFIG_64BIT' in some places) but not here.

Does the handler have access to the _IOC_SIZE() value that was passed? If
it does, we could add a conditional inside of v4l_querybuf().
I did not see an easy way to do that though.

Agreed.

Yes, makes sense. I think for the other structures I just enclosed them
inside #ifdef __KERNEL__ so they get stripped at 'make headers_install'
time, but I forgot to do that here.

My intention was to keep the structure close to the other one, so any
changes to them would be more likely to make it into both versions.

Let me know if you prefer to have an #ifdef added here, or if I should
move all three structures to v4l2-ioctl.h.

Thanks a lot for the review!
