Yeah, scanout buffers are special and imo we should only uses fences
as barriers just around the flip, but _not_ to prevent frontbuffer in
general. Userspace is after all allowed to do that (e.g. with the dumb
bo ioctls). If we'd premanently lock scanout buffers that would indeed
result in hilarity all over the place, no surprises there. And all
current drivers with dynamic memory management solve this through
pinning, but not by restricting write access at all.

So I think we can shrug this scenario off as a non-issue of the "don't
do this" kind ;-) Thierry, is there anything else you've stumbled over
in the tegra k1 enabling work?

I still get the impression that there's an awful lot of
misunderstandings between the explicit and implicit syncing camps and
that we need to do a lot more talking for a better understanding ...

Cheers, Daniel
