I agree with you here, and this mismatch between the V4L and UVC controls is 
the reason why I haven't implemented relative pan/tilt support.

We could extend the meaning of the controls to cover the UVC behaviour in a 
device-specific fashion, but that would be confusing for applications, so new 
controls might be a better idea.
