This patch series cleanup's the VPSS clock enabling.
The first patch removes vpss clock enabling from the capture
drivers and moves it to the VPSS driver itself.
The second patch moves the venc_enable_vpss_clock() to the driver
which was being done in platform code.

Changes for v3:
1: Changed the commit message for first patch as pointed by Sekhar.
2: Removed a semicolon after NULL in con_ids as pointed by Sekhar.
3: Included the Ack from Sekhar for first patch.

Changes for v2:
1: Used PM runtime API for clock handling and nit's pointed by Sekhar.

  media: davinci: vpbe: venc: move the enabling of vpss clocks to
    driver
  davinic: vpss: trivial cleanup
