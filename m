Decoupling CONFIG_VIDEO_V4L2_SUBDEV_API from the availability of the in-kernel 
pad format and selection rectangles helpers is definitely a good idea. I was 
thinking about decoupling the try format and rectangles from v4l2_subdev_fh by 
creating a kind of configuration store structure to store them, and embedding 
that structure in v4l2_subdev_fh. The pad-level operations would then take a 
pointer to the configuration store instead of the v4l2_subdev_fh. Bridge 
drivers that want to implement TRY_FMT based on pad-level operations would 
create a configuration store, use the pad-level operations, and destroy the 
configuration store. The userspace subdev API would use the configuration 
store from the file handle.
