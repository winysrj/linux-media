As written there the Görler Telekom bought the business and stock of TT, 
that includes the brand name, all products and most of the developers. 
They formed a new Company called TechnoTrend Görler GmbH, that will 
continue development, production and sales.

See here: http://www.kathrein.de//en/press/cont/texte2009/pi0910.htm

Even if not explicitely mentioned there, PC products are included in 
that deal.

New web site is still under construction: http://www.ttgoerler.de/
