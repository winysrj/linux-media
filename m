Subject: [PATCH 6/7] reservation: cross-device reservation support
Date: Tue, 15 Jan 2013 13:34:03 +0100
Message-Id: <1358253244-11453-7-git-send-email-maarten.lankhorst@canonical.com>
In-Reply-To: <1358253244-11453-1-git-send-email-maarten.lankhorst@canonical.com>
References: <1358253244-11453-1-git-send-email-maarten.lankhorst@canonical.com>
Sender: linux-media-owner@vger.kernel.org
List-ID: <linux-media.vger.kernel.org>

This adds support for a generic reservations framework that can be
hooked up to ttm and dma-buf and allows easy sharing of reservations
across devices.

The idea is that a dma-buf and ttm object both will get a pointer
to a struct reservation_object, which has to be reserved before
anything is done with the contents of the dma-buf.
