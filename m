Part of problem is that adp1653 is not regarded as "LED" device by
current kernel driver.

I don't get it; system-status describes single LED, why are iout-torch
(and friends) arrays of two?

Also, at least on adp1653, these are actually two leds -- white and
red. Torch and flash is white led, indicator is red led.

What device are you using for testing? Can you cc me on future
patches?

Why do we need complex "flash LED class" support, and where is the
V4L2 glue?
