I am using the current git version of Linux 2.6 and I was wondering if somebody is still working on Apple remote support?

I've found this patch[1] which seems to add support for the Apple remote, but it does not compile any more with the current git tree.

The Apple remote is a very popular device and it would be nice if the mainline kernel would support it.


Regards,
Andreas
