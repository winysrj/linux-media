I donâ€™t think it is a complex problem, just I waste too time on v4l2 part
All the current clock frequency at rk3328 is too low for H.264 decoding you may find my previous mail.

I have not. I would like to move my work on userspace interface later, as I said in IRC.
MPEG-2 is just a simple codec I choose for demo(userspace and some not normal picture coded like fileds) and if there is a codec parser there, I can solve it easily.
Adding support to new codec is not complex in this driver once the interface problem is solved. I just copy the public rockchip mpp userspace library into it. It is the other advantage use the register structure.
But I do like people to merge the final version I submit, I would prove it why later.
