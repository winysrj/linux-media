lockdep just requires a bunch of annotations, is a compile-time configure
option CONFIG_PROVE_LOCKING and if disabled, has zero overhead. And it's
rather awesome in detected deadlocks and handling crazy locking schemes
correctly:
- correctly handles trylocks
- correctly handles nested locking (i.e. grabbing a global lock, then
  grabbing subordinate locks in an unordered sequence since the global
  lock ensures that no deadlocks can happen).
- any kinds of inversions with special contexts like hardirq, softirq
- same for page-reclaim, i.e. it will yell if you could (potentially)
  deadlock because your shrinker grabs a lock that you hold while calling
  kmalloc.
- there are special annotates for various subsystems, e.g. to check for
  del_timer_sync vs. locks held by that timer. Or the console_lock
  annotations I've just recently submitted.
- all that with a really flexible set of annotation primitives that afaics
  should work for almost any insane locking scheme. The fact that Maarten
  could come up with proper reservation annotations without any changes to
  lockdep testifies this (he only had to fix a tiny thing to make it a bit
  more strict in a corner case).

In short I think it's made of awesome. The only downside is that it lacks
documentation, you have to read the code to understand it :(

The reason I've suggested to Maarten to abolish the trylock_reservation
within the lru_lock is that in that way lockdep only ever sees the
trylock, and hence is less strict about complainig about deadlocks. But
semantically it's an unconditional reserve. Maarten had some horrible
hacks that leaked the lockdep annotations out of the new reservation code,
which allowed ttm to be properly annotated.  But those also reduced the
usefulness for any other users of the reservation code, and so Maarten
looked into whether he could remove that trylock dance in ttm.

Imo having excellent lockdep support for cross-device reservations is a
requirment, and ending up with less strict annotations for either ttm
based drivers or other drivers is not good. And imo the ugly layering that
Maarten had in his first proof-of-concept also indicates that something is
amiss in the design.

[I'll refrain from comment on ttm specifics to not make a fool of me ;-)]

tbh, this should be a simple testsuite that you can just run. Like we're
(slowly) building up for drm/i915 in intel-gpu-tools. At least that'll be
one of the merge requirements for i915.ko.
