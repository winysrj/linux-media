I have and I haven't seen any way how

   void *()(struct request_queue *q, unsigned size, gfp_t gfp);

prototype could be applied to CMA.  I admit that I haven't read the whole
discussion of the patch and maybe I'm missing something about Andi's patches
but I don't see how CMA could but from what I've understood blk_kmalloc() is
dissimilar to CMA.  I'll be glad if you could show me where I'm wrong.

Yes, but I don't really know what you have in mind.  CMA is similar to various
APIs in various ways: it's similar to any allocator since it takes size in bytes,
it's similar to coherent since it takes device, it's similar to bootmem/memblock/etc
since it takes alignment.  I would appreciate if you could give some examples of what
you mean by similar and ideas haw CMA's API may be improved.

Ah, sorry.  I misunderstood you.  I thought you were replying to both 2. and 3.
above.

If we only take allocating algorithm then you're right.  Reusing existing one
should not increase the patch size plus it would be probably a better solution.

No matter, I would rather first work and core CMA without worrying about reusing
kmalloc()/coherent/etc. code especially since providing a plugable allocator API
integration with existing allocating algorithms can be made later on.  To put it
short I want first to make it work and then improve it.
