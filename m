I've changed the patch to still auto-activate, but "locally": a new
key-event will only be forced if the previously received code was a
repeat-code. This is means that non-compliant remotes will work as
before, and compliant remotes will work better: key's need to be pressed
at least for 1 repeat interval (nominally 100ms) for this feature to
activate.

I've tried this on my setup, and while it's better than the original, it
is, for me, still unacceptable. The previous version of this patch allowed
me to do a quick "3 times down". This version (and the original) doesn't.
So I'm not even posting this one.

Which makes me wonder: It seems as if it's impossible to differentiate
between the two types of remotes before the first repeat is sent, and by
then it's too late.  And it's not acceptable to latch the
repeat-code-capable flag in to the kernel. Would it be an option to make
this user-configurable? Either by splitting NEC into two variants, or by
using a parameter somehow? And if so: what is the preferred way?
