The discussions didn't finish yet. We can't hold pushing the patches
forever due to a few patches in this series, and there's another pull
request waiting for this to be merged.

We can latter send a fix for the patches that are not ok early at
-rc tests, or next week if we come on an agreement.

Regards,
Mauro
