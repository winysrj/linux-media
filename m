yeah, INIT_WORK does more.. although maybe some day we want
INIT_FENCE_CB to do more (ie. if we add some debug features to help
catch misuse of fence/fence-cb's).  And if nothing else, having it
look a bit like other constructs that we have in the kernel seems
useful.  And with my point below, you'd want INIT_FENCE_CB to do a
INIT_LIST_HEAD(), so it is (very) slightly more than just setting the
fxn ptr.

I was thinking for crtc and page-flip, embed the fence_cb in the crtc.
 You should only use the cb once at a time, but in this case you might
want to re-use it for the next page flip.  Having something to catch
cb mis-use in this sort of scenario seems useful.

maybe how I am thinking to use fence_cb is not quite what you had in
mind.  I'm not sure.  I was trying to think how I could just directly
use fence/fence_cb in msm for everything (imported dmabuf or just
regular 'ol gem buffers).

well, names are important to convey meaning, and not confusing users
of the API..  but fence_context*s*_alloc() also sounds a bit funny.
So I could live w/ just some kerneldoc.  Ie. move the doc about
fence_counter_contex down and make it doc about the function.  That
was a bit my point about moving the function into the .c and making
fence_context_counter static.. ie. I don't think it was your intention
that anyone accesses fence_counter_context directly, so better to
document the function and make fence_counter_context the internal
implementation detail.

Anyways, some of this is a bit nit-picky, but since fence is going to
be something used by many different drivers/subsystems, I guess it is
worthwhile to nit-pick over the API.
