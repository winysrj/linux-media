HVR2200 is a cool new card, dual hybrid analog / digital........  but
Nova-TD-500 is *not* end of life -- the card is still available, and
there are still new Nova-TD-500 cards being made, and new drivers are
available in my bristol repository.  The new card (Nova-TD-500) is not
available on the market yet, but the driver is -- the card will be
supported long before people have it in their hands.
