Dear Guennadi

Thank your for checking patch.

Of course I tested it.

Hmm. I should have asked you what is MASTER/SLAVE before sending patch.
I suspect it it about who generates the clock signal 
either the camera or the host.
Our CEU does not support any clock generation so it is always SLAVE.
Therefore I didn't support MASTER for CEU.

But it seems wrong understanding...
I would like ask you What MASTER/SLAVE means ?

Best regards
