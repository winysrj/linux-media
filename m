I checked the usage of vb2_dma_contig_set_max_seg_size(). What it
does is to allocate dev->dma_parms and call dma_set_max_seg_size().

Allocating dev->dma_parms change the behavior of 2 function pairs 
(inlined at dma_mapping.h):

1) dma_get_seg_boundary() / dma_set_seg_boundary()

As no media drivers use dev->dma_parms->segment_boundary_mask,
it will keep returning DMA_BIT_MASK(32), either calling or not
the VB2-specific function.

1) dma_get_max_seg_size() / dma_set_max_seg_size()

Checking where dma_get_max_seg_size() is used returns:

$ git grep dma_get_max_seg_size
arch/alpha/kernel/pci_iommu.c:  max_seg_size = dev ? dma_get_max_seg_size(dev) : 0;
arch/arm/mm/dma-mapping.c:      unsigned int max = dma_get_max_seg_size(dev);
arch/ia64/hp/common/sba_iommu.c:        unsigned int max_seg_size = dma_get_max_seg_size(dev);
arch/powerpc/kernel/iommu.c:    max_seg_size = dma_get_max_seg_size(dev);
arch/s390/pci/pci_dma.c:        unsigned int max = dma_get_max_seg_size(dev);
arch/sparc/kernel/iommu.c:      max_seg_size = dma_get_max_seg_size(dev);
arch/sparc/kernel/pci_sun4v.c:  max_seg_size = dma_get_max_seg_size(dev);
arch/x86/kernel/amd_gart_64.c:  max_seg_size    = dma_get_max_seg_size(dev);
drivers/firewire/sbp2.c:        if (dma_get_max_seg_size(device->card->device) > SBP2_MAX_SEG_SIZE)
drivers/iio/buffer/industrialio-buffer-dmaengine.c:     dmaengine_buffer->max_size = dma_get_max_seg_size(chan->device->dev);
drivers/iommu/dma-iommu.c:      unsigned int cur_len = 0, max_len = dma_get_max_seg_size(dev);
drivers/media/common/videobuf2/videobuf2-dma-contig.c:  if (dma_get_max_seg_size(dev) < size)
drivers/mmc/host/mmci.c:                unsigned int max_seg_size = dma_get_max_seg_size(dev);
drivers/mmc/host/mmci.c:                unsigned int max_seg_size = dma_get_max_seg_size(dev);
drivers/mmc/host/mxcmmc.c:              mmc->max_seg_size = dma_get_max_seg_size(
drivers/mmc/host/mxs-mmc.c:     mmc->max_seg_size = dma_get_max_seg_size(ssp->dmach->device->dev);
drivers/parisc/iommu-helpers.h: unsigned int max_seg_size = min(dma_get_max_seg_size(dev),
drivers/scsi/scsi_lib.c:        blk_queue_max_segment_size(q, dma_get_max_seg_size(dev));
drivers/spi/spi.c:      unsigned int max_seg_size = dma_get_max_seg_size(dev);
include/linux/dma-mapping.h:static inline unsigned int dma_get_max_seg_size(struct device *dev)
lib/dma-debug.c:        unsigned int max_range = dma_get_max_seg_size(ref->dev);
sound/soc/soc-generic-dmaengine-pcm.c:  hw.period_bytes_max = dma_get_max_seg_size(dma_dev);

As vb2_dma_contig_set_max_seg_size() is called only on ARM drivers
for Exynos and Mediatek, we only need to check where it is used inside
arch/arm/mm/dma-mapping.c. There, only __iommu_map_sg() function
calls it. So, except if mis-named, I would be expecting it to be used
only for Scatter/Gather DMA.

So, it seems that, with the current code, setting it for dma_contig 
probably does nothing.

Please double-check, as things like that can be tricky.

IMO, it is worth removing vb2_dma_contig_set_max_seg_size() and be sure that
the drivers calls it are calling dma_coerce_mask_and_coherent().

Thanks,
Mauro
