Applied, thanks.

>From what I understood from your comments, this driver will also cover 
wl127x chips. As such, it would be better to double check if all functionalities
present at drivers/media/radio/radio-wl1273.c (assuming that wl1273 is covered)
are also on the new driver, and, if not, merge the remaining ones and deprecate
the wl1273-specific driver.

Cheers,
Mauro
