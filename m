I don't think that this is a hardware problem. I think it is related to 
the driver. When I added support for the S2-3650CI to Dominik Kuhlen's 
code for the PC-TV452e, I used the RC-code function "pctv452e_rc_query" 
for the S2-3650CI. I ran into this problem back then and thought that 
setting .rc_interval to 500 would "fix" the problem good enough. Since I 
never used the supplied remote with my box, I never looked into the 
problem again.

Unfortunately I do not know how to fix this problem. If anyone has some 
insights on reading remote control inputs, please take a look here and 
see if you can fix the problem:
http://mercurial.intuxication.org/hg/s2-liplianin/file/7e47ba1d4ae8/linux/drivers/media/dvb/dvb-usb/pctv452e.c#l1355
The remote is the same as the one shipped with the TT-S1500. So the code 
for reading the remote input should already exist.
