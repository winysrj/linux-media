Being able to align dishes to the correct sats @ the best signal is
definitely of interest to many people and since linux lacks a good
signal meter/sat identifier, there is much hope these talks will
actually lead to something tangible for users.  There is also a big
worry that it will degrade to personal conflicts and stall out with no
progress.  Let's cross our fingers the greater good for the users and
a working usable solution is the end result!!
