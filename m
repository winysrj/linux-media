Shubhrajyoti,

Thanks for your patches.

I'm adding media maintainer (Mauro) in Cc. When you send
patches for a file you should check who maintains them
and put those people in Cc.

This is really easy with get_maintainer.pl. You can also
check with git log / git blame to see who has been working
on that file.

You should read Documentation/SubmittingPatches
if you haven't already (and read it again if you already have ;-)

IMO, sending several different patches with the same commit
subject is not the best thing to do.

Perhaps this is too much to ask, but I'd prefer something
like:

media: saa7706h: Convert struct i2c_msg initialization to C99 format
