The two problems you show here are not a real problems in this framework:
1. making real device initialization during drm initialization - 
decision is left
to driver developer what should be done in probe, what should be done in
'bind', I guess this is also true for components, at least the framework 
allows it.
2. initialization order - if you put initialization into components 
'bind' function,
master can choose any order of calls to 'bind'.

Anyway you can implement the same behaviour as components with
interface_tracker. Just simple proof of concept, how to convert 
componentized
drivers to interface_tracker:
Components:
1. you can reuse component_ops
2. You replace calls of component_add and component_del with calls
to interface_tracker_ifup(dev, INTERFACE_TRACKER_TYPE_COMPONENT, 
&specific_component_ops),
or interface_tracker_ifdown.
Thats all for components.

Master:
1. you register callback for tracking all components.
2. in the callback you check if all components are up, if yes you do the
same as in component framework initialization, to simplify it
helper function can be added.

I guess it should work the same way, if there is interest in it I can 
develop the
helper next week, I hope.

What is the benefit of interface_tracker:
1. interface_tracker is more generic - it can track not only components.
2. you put component initialization code into helper function - sounds 
like mid-layer removal,
developer can choose different helper if it suits better.

So from component point of view interface_tracker can be treated as kind 
of extensions
of the component framework.

I hope I have answerer all your concerns.

I have holidays till Sunday and I am not sure if I will be able to 
answer next emails before
Monday.

Andrzej
