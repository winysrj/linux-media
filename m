Hi,

Very unlucky, i bought a pinnacle hybrid pro and couldn't get it to work 
with linux, then i gave it up, and i found that HVR-900 card works well 
under linux, i got one, but i didn't know that the company is referring 
now for 900 same as 900H.

900H doesn't work under Linux, is there is way to get this card working?

googling i didn't find much information, all i found is work under way 
to get this card supported (2008).

Please help,
.
