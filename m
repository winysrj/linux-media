Dear all,
I need the old revision of the mxl500x-af9015 to driver the USB device
07ca:815c from AVerMedia.
Original path is:  http://linuxtv.org/hg/~anttip/af9015-mxl500x

the wanted revision is af9015-mxl500x-1487a7dcf22a or other
newer/latest revision.

One of my friend in his company has successfully use the driver to watch TV,
but he cannot send the source to me according company policy.

Is it not integrated into mainline kernel?


Best Regards,
cwz0522
