I agree.  We could also have a read with extra options macro and a write
with extra options macro.  That would give four macros, which is not too
much more than three.

I would be happy to do the rest, or at least to do more.  I just didn't
want to do 600+ cases before knowing how others felt about the various
changes.  Actually, now that we seem to have decided to make fewer changes
at once, I could probably work more quickly.  So far, I have been
comparing the results after running cpp, as well as checking that the
sizeof transformation is correct, which is a bit slow.

The main goal just seems to be to provide something that is more readable.

OK, if it doesn't seem like a good idea, it is no problem to drop the idea
completely.  It does seem a bit nicer to have writing indicated as WRITE
rather than as 0, but that might not be a big enough benefit to justify
making changes.
