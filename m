I've thought about that, but it would require iss.h to be included before all 
other headers. I've also thought about creating an iss-debug.h header to be 
included first just to #define DEBUG, but decided to go for handling the OMAP4 
ISS debug option in the Makefile instead. If that's ugly and discouraged as 
reported by Mauro I can try to come up with something else.
