That's very much in line with the KS/LPC spirit, I'd like to see that happen 
as well. We've been talking about media controller support in ALSA for ages 
:-)

Information about future directions is unfortunately usually private, but we 
can always ask. To be honest I sometimes feel like even SoC vendors themselves 
don't know where they're heading to :-) If only that, a presentation about the 
latest media-related hardware developments on ARM would be good to get 
everybody up to speed.
