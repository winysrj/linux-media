I'll fold it in to the patch that added reservation_object_reserve_shared.

Yes it is, shared_count may be increased, leading to potential different sizes for krealloc and memcpy
if the ACCESS_ONCE is removed. I could use shared_max here instead, which stays the same,
but it would waste more memory.

But shared_count is only known when holding the rcu lock.

What about this change?
