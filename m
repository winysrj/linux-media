Hi,

This series allows the TXA CSI-2 transmitter of the adv748x to function 
in 1-, 2- and 4- lane mode. Currently the driver fixes the hardware in 
4-lane mode. The driver looks at the standard DT property 'data-lanes' 
to determine which mode it should operate in.

Patch 1/3 adds the DT parsing and storing of the number of lanes. Patch 
2/3 adds functionality for intercepting and injecting the requested 
number of lanes when writing the register for NUM_LANES for the TXA 
register 0x00. Lastly patch 3/3 fixes a type related to lane settings 
for TXB which is confusing (at lest to me) when reviewing the result of 
this series.

Patch 1/3 and 2/3 could be squashed together but as the method in 2/3 is 
less then obvious since it intercepts the long tables of register writes 
I thought splitting them could ease review.

The series is based on the latest media-tree master and is tested on 
Renesas M3-N in 1-, 2- and 4- lane mode.

  i2c: adv748x: store number of CSI-2 lanes described in device tree
  i2c: adv748x: configure number of lanes used for TXA CSI-2 transmitter
