Yes, I think they do the rest from userspace, not sure though :)

So loop data from kernel -> userspace -> kernelspace and finally back to=20
userspace and the media application? I agree that you need a way to pipe=20
the incoming data directly from the network to userspace for those TSN=20
users that can handle it. But again, for media-applications that don't know=
=20
(or care) about AVB, it should be fed to ALSA/v4l2 directly and not jump=20
between kernel and userspace an extra round.

I get the point of not including every single audio/video encoder in the=20
kernel, but raw audio should be piped directly to alsa. V4L2 has a way of=
=20
piping encoded video through the system and to the media application (in=20
order to support cameras that to encoding). The same approach should be=20
doable for AVB, no? (someone from alsa/v4l2 should probably comment on=20
this)

Configuring this via the audio-interface is going to be a challenge since=
=20
you need to configure the stream through the network before you can create=
=20
the audio interface. If not, you will have to either drop data or block the=
=20
caller until the link has been fully configured.

This is actually the reason why configfs is used in the series now, as it=
=20
allows userspace to figure out all the different attributes and configure=
=20
the link before letting ALSA start pushing data.

Yes, I agree, presentation-time and local time needs to be handled=20
properly. The same for adjusting sample-rate etc. This is a lot of work, so=
=20
I hope you can understand why I started out with a simple approach to spark=

a discussion before moving on to the larger bits.

Se response above, better to let anything but uncompressed raw data trickle=

Hehe, no, bad phrasing on my part. I want *both* (hence the shim-interface)=

:)

Yes, I know some audio apps "use networking", I can stream netradio, I can=
=20
use jack to connect devices using RTP and probably a whole lot of other=20
applications do similar things. However, AVB is more about using the=20
network as a virtual sound-card. For the media application, it should not=
=20
have to care if the device it is using is a soudncard inside the box or a=

set of AVB-capable speakers somewhere on the network.

I assumed that when you had a mmap'd buffer you'd have to specify a point=
=20
in time at which the frame should be sent. And since a class A has a 125us=
=20
interval of sending frames, you have to be able to send frames with enough=
=20
accuray to that. That's a pretty strict deadline coming from userspace. But=
=20
as they say, never assume.

I have a lot to dig into, and I've gotten a lot of very useful pointers. I=
=20
should be busy for a while
