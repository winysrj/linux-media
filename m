This is a driver for the Analog Devices ADV748x device, and follows on from a
previous posting by Niklas SÃ¶derlund [0] of an earlier incarnation of this
driver.

Aside from a few bug fixes, and considerable refactoring this driver:
 - is refactored to multiple object files
 - defines multiple sub devices for the output paths.
 - has independent controls for both HDMI and Analog video paths

 - Specifies 'endpoint' matching instead of 'device' in async framework

These patches are based up on Niklas' pending RVin work [1] and Sakari's fwnode
series [2]

This version is the culmination of large refactoring and development, and I
believe is ready (or near) for mainline integration.

ADV748x
=======
The ADV7481 and ADV7482 support two video pipelines which can run independently
of each other, with each pipeline terminating in a CSI-2 output: TXA (4-Lane)
and TXB (1-Lane)

The ADV7480 (Not yet included here), ADV7481, and ADV7482 are all derivatives,
with the following features

            Analog   HDMI  MHL  4-Lane  1-Lane
              In      In         CSI     CSI
 ADV7480               X    X     X
 ADV7481      X        X    X     X       X
 ADV7482      X        X          X       X

Implementation
==============

This RFC creates 4 entities. AFE (CVBS/Analog In), HDMI, TXA and TXB.  At probe
time, the DT is parsed to identify the endpoints for each of these nodes, and
those are used for async matching of the CSI2 (TXA/TXB) entities in the master
driver. The HDMI and AFE entities are then registered after a successful
registration of both the CSI2 entities.

(Known) Future Todo's
=====================

Further potential development areas include:
 - ADV7480 Support (No AFE)
 - MHL support (Not present on ADV7482)
 - EDID support
 - CEC Support
 - Configurable I2C addressing
 - Interrupt handling for format changes and hotplug detect.

However, this driver is functional without the above, and these developments
can be written when required.

v1/RFC:
 - Initial posting

v2:
 - Reworked DT parsing and entities

v3:
 - Refreshed with lots of fixups from Sakari's review comments

v4:
 - Many changes all round, following Laurent's review and extensive development
 - Now uses regmap
 - AFE port numbering has been changed to match the entity pads
 -
