There are three cases to worry about:
 - Coherent long lived page table mirroring (RDMA ODP MR)
 - Non-coherent long lived page table mirroring (RDMA MR)
 - Short lived DMA mapping (everything else)

Like you say below we have to handle short lived in the usual way, and
that covers basically every device except IB MRs, including the
command queue on a NVMe drive.

Yes, absolutely, some kind of page pinning like locking is a hard
requirement.

Is there any progress on that?

I still don't quite get what iopmem was about.. I thought the
objection to uncachable ZONE_DEVICE & DAX made sense, so running DAX
over iopmem and still ending up with uncacheable mmaps still seems
like a non-starter to me...

Serguei, what is your plan in GPU land for migration? Ie if I have a
CPU mapped page and the GPU moves it to VRAM, it becomes non-cachable
- do you still allow the CPU to access it? Or do you swap it back to
cachable memory if the CPU touches it?

One approach might be to mmap the uncachable ZONE_DEVICE memory and
mark it inaccessible to the CPU - DMA could still translate. If the
CPU needs it then the kernel migrates it to system memory so it
becomes cachable. ??
