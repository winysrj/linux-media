Just replying to the interface/doc comments, Maarten's the guy for the
gory details ;-)

I think it helps the code clarity to have special slowpath locking
functions. But it also helps with interface safety:
- __must_check int vs. void returns values sign up gcc to help check
for correct usage. Of course the first locking operation can't really
fail, but since those usually happen in a loop this shouldn't ever
hurt. At least the examples all need to check the return value to be
correct.
- _slow functions can check whether all acquire locks have been
released and whether the caller is indeed blocking on the contending
lock. Not doing so could either result in needless spinning instead of
blocking (when blocking on the wrong lock) or in deadlocks (when not
dropping all acquired).

Together with the debug patch to forcefully go through the slowpath
this should catch all interface abuse. Dropping the _slow functions
would rid us of this nice safety net.

Again it signs up gcc with the __must_check int vs. void return
values. In addition you don't need to set up a ww_acquire_ctx for the
single version. Since gem/ttm has quite a few interfaces to check the
status of buffer objects we have a lot of places that only acquire the
lock for a single object. So I think the added interface scope is
worth the upside of simpler code in ww mutex users.

See above, it's only for better debugging checks and (imho) clearer
code in the ww mutex users.

Thanks ;-) And I think it was a good exercise in clarfying the details
of the interfaces and especially checking whether full debugging will
catch all the MUST and MUST NOT case. Like I've mentioned in the docs
somewhere I'm fairly convinced that the only untested ww mutex user
bug is not taking all required locks, everything else should be fully
covered.

Cheers, Daniel
