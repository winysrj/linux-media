hello,

I have a medion dvb stick (id 1660:1921) which is not supported yet.

This stick is made by creatix polymedia and is based on a dib7770 chip
(like the terratec XXS id 0ccd:00ab).

I managed to get it work this way on ubuntu 8.04 using kernel
2.6.24-26generic:

-downloaded the latest sources using mercurial

-made these changes in
~/v4l-dvb/linux/drivers/media/dvb/dvb-usb/dvb-usb-ids.h :

replaced
#define USB_VID_TERRATEC 0x0ccd
with
#define USB_VID_TERRATEC 0x1660

and
#define USB_PID_TERRATEC_CINERGY_T_XXS_2 0x00ab
with
#define USB_PID_TERRATEC_CINERGY_T_XXS_2 0x1921

-downloaded firmware dvb-usb-dib0700-1.20.fw
to /lib/firmware/2.6.24-26-generic

-compiled and installed modules.

the stick works perfectly with kaffeine, me-tv and vlc (no others
software tested) on french networks, at least for viewing tv (I haven't
tested the remote function).
The only bug I found is if I unplug the stick and plug it back, it
doesn't work anymore. I have to reboot to make it work again.

It is recognized as a terratec stick, here is the dmesg output:

I know this way of making it work is not really clean.

If I can do anything to help developing team to include this stick in
the list of supported ones, just ask.
