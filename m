I have tried the TT Ct2650 C/T CI as a DVB-T tuner with the same  
negative result. I have heard that there is some work going on but  
haven't hear of any definitive positive results yet.

As i am no programmer but fairly well in using linux i cam contribute  
on testing and documenting if there is some positive results.

Still hoping...
