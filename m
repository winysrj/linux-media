Hello !

I have been searching for info on the Samsung TECC1149FG01A tuner chip =
used in my tv wonder 650 pci for a long time now.

I have found the following so far=20

1st I found that the manufactur was SEM , then after a lot of conversion =
of chinese pages into english I found that it was made by EMC.

It is referred to as 8 BIT MCU 1K ROM QTP - I don't know what that means =
maybe someone would know.  It also has the following in the translation =
- {Rowe Price (SWPH3A3.CDS)}

Using SWPH3A3.CDS i get to the line below.

EMC part number is Q8156E-PSA03P.  According to what i have found it =
seems this chip is from a chinese manufacturer.

Maybe  this will help someone extend the knowledge we have on this card.

Jeff M
