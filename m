Having just talked this through with Jacopo I think I see that we have
two topics getting intertwined here too.

 - Address translation so that we can separate the camera addressing

 - our 'device_is_bound/device_for_each_child()' workaround which lets
   us make sure the buses are closed before we power on any camera
   device.


For the upstream process of this driver - I will remove the
'device_is_bound()/device_for_each_child()' workarounds.


It is /ugly/ and needs more consideration, but I believe we do still
need it (or something similar) for our platform currently.



The other side of that is the address translation. I think I was wrong
earlier and may have said we have address translation on both sides.


I think I now see that we only have some minimal translation for two
addresses on the remote (max9271) side, not the local (max9286) side.

We have the ability to reprogram addresses through, and that's what we
are using.


There's a lot more local discussion going on here that I may have missed
so I hope Jacopo, Niklas, or Laurent may add more here if relevant :)

Hrm ... I was sure I uploaded to the conference so that they should have
been available on that URL - but they are not showing.

They are available here:

	https://www.slideshare.net/KieranBingham/gmsl-in-linux

(Please excuse the incorrect date on the first slide :D)

I had put a proposal in to give this talk again at ELCE but
unfortunately it didn't get accepted.

Seems it really would have been useful to have a slot. Lets hope next
ELCE is too late and we work out a good system by then :)

Ok - I understand how you were using the terminology / analogy's now.
Lets move back to patch 1/4 :)
