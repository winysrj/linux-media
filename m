I guess simply porting radio-maestro codes into snd-es1968 would work
without much hustles, and it's a bit safe way to go for now; smaller
changes have less chance for breakage, and as little people seem using
this driver, it'd be better to take a safer option, IMO.

If we have active testers for both devices, it's nicer to go forward
to clean-up works indeed, though.


thanks,
