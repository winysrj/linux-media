Thanks for the tip. I had the pciehp driver installed, but it was a 
module and not loaded. I didn't have acpiphp enabled at all. Building 
them both in statically, appears to have papered over the cracks of the 
oops :-)

Those discussions are way above my level of knowledge. I guess all this 
work will be merged into mainline in due course, so I'll watch for them 
in 3.9 or later. Unless, of course, there is a tree I could clone and 
help test the changes with my laptop and expresscard.

Hotplug isn't working at all on my Fujitsu laptop, so I can only get the 
card recognised by rebooting with the card inserted (or by writing 1 
to/sys/bus/pci/rescan). There seem to be a few reports on this in the 
kernel bugzilla, so I'll look through them and see what's being done.

Thanks again.

Chris
