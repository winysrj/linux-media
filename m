See my other mail where I propose a more explicit coherency model, just a
comment here: GPU drivers hate blocking interfaces. Loathe, actually. In
general they're very happy to extend you any amount of rope if it can make
userspace a few percent faster.

So I think the right answer here is: You've asked for trouble, you've got
it. Also see the issue raised by Rob, at least for opengl (and also for
other graphics interfaces) the kernel is not even aware of all outstanding
rendering. So userspace needs to orchestrate access anyway if a gpu is
involved.

Otherwise I agree with your points in this mail.
