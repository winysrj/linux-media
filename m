Isn't it better to return an error?

True, but the latter is easily implemented using the separate
port/endpoint iteration. So I see it as a more powerful API.

Yes, I understand that. What I wonder is that which is easier: make it a
public API now, more or less as it was in v4l2, or make it a public API
only when all the improvements we can think of have been made.

So my fear is that the API is now made public, and you and others start
to use it. But I can't use it, as I need things like separate
port/endpoint iteration. I need to add those, which also means that I
need to change all the users of the API, making the task more difficult
than I'd like.

However, this is more of "thinking out loud" than "I don't like the
series". It's a good series =3D).

I would have a helper, which should do some sanity checks, like that the
node names are "endpoint".

Ok.

In omapdss each driver handles only the ports and endpoints defined for
its device, and they can be considered private to that device. The only
reason to look for the remote endpoint is to find the remote device. To
me the omapdss model makes sense, and feels logical and sane =3D). So I
have to say I'm not really familiar with the model you're using.

Of course, the different get_remove_* funcs do no harm, even if we have
a bunch of them. My point was only about enforcing the correct use of
the model, where "correct" is of course subjective =3D).

Ok. I guess if you have a fixed model for the video pipeline elements it
works out. For omapdss we don't know what's there on the remote side, as
we can have arbitrary amount of video pipeline elements.
