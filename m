What is the final destiny of this patch series?
I found that only "codec driver for SI476X MFD" is pushed in kernel
3.8 by Mark Brown and that's all, is it? I can't find this patch
series on patchwork.linuxtv.org or in media git trees, for example,
scheduled for 3.9.

I also see that comments for this patches aren't answered and looks
like v4 is necessary.
Andrey, do you plan to make v4 series? May be it was already emailed
but i can't find it. Maybe review or comments from alsa and mfd
communities are missed?

So, without v4 it will not find its way into kernel, right?
