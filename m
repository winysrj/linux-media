Hello Hasan,

In the kernel 2.6.34, the sensor mi0360soc sequences have been changed
to make the webcams 0ac8:301b work, but these sequences are wrong for
the webcams 0ac8:303b.

An other user is testing the fix which is in my test tarball (see my
home page below - current version 2.10.4). There is just one remaining
problem: the image is mirrored, and I have not found yet how to set it
normal...

Best regards.
