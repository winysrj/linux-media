Yeah, more or less. Although you need to wrap everything into ticket
reservation locking so that you can atomically update fences if you
have support for some form of device2device singalling (i.e. without
blocking on the cpu until all the old users completed). At least
that's the main point of Maarten's patches (and this does work with
prime between a few drivers by now), but ofc you can use cpu blocking
as a fallback.

The fence doesn't give ownership of the dma_buf object, but only
indicates when the dma access will have completed. The relationship
between dma_buf/reservation and the attached fences specify whether
other hw engines can access the dma_buf, too (if the fence is
non-exclusive).

Rob and Maarten are working on some howtos and documentation with
example code, I guess it'd be best to wait a bit until we have that.
Or just review the existing stuff Rob just posted and reply with
questions there.

Cheers, Daniel
