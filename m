Haven't look at the series yet. I just arrived from ELC/Linux Media conf.

Yes, the idea is that LIRC is an option for most devices. For devices
with TX, however, it would make sense to always have an association, if
compiled with LIRC support (otherwise, TX would be disabled).

Maybe we could track this with an additional config option (CONFIG_IR_TX?).

Good point.

Changing NEC would break userspace, as existing tables won't work.
So, no matter what I think, changing it won't happen as we're not
allowed to break userspace.

(and yes, I think NEC16 is *the* NEC protocol; the other are just
variants made by some vendors to fill their needs)

Not sure about that, but this is a different matter.

Starting from scratch sounds a bad idea. We don't do that on Linux,
except when we really screwed everything very badly. Also, the input
developers already denied adding a separate chardev with its own API
when we started discussing about the remote controller core.

Adding a new chardev would make things very confusing, as we'll need
to keep reporting data on both new and old chardev. We have this already
for LIRC, but with different interfaces, so, no big issue. Also, LIRC
can be dynamically disabled at runtime. So, it seems that this is the
best approach, IMO.
