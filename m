drawing the picture for myself:

	task-O	task-M	task-Y
			A
		B
	B
		A

No, we always need to wait for locks to be unlocked. The sole purpose
of the special wakeups state is to not wake other (!ww_mutex) locks
that might be held by the task holding the contended ww_mutex. While
all schedule() sites should deal with spurious wakeups its a sad fact
of life that they do not :/

I'm reading "Get The F*ck Out" ? I like the name, except PF_flags are
unsuitable since they are not atomic and we'd need to set it from
another thread.

So its the contending task (O for B) setting PF_GTFO on the owning task
(M for B), right?

But yeah, all ww_mutex sleep states should have the new TASK_DEADLOCK
sleep state added.

I would really rather see -EDEADLK for that..

Right.

ww_mutex, it should block just fine on regular mutexes and other
primitives.

Right, I think we're understanding one another here.
