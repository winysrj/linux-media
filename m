Hey Mauro,

Hope everything is well.

People have noticed that the tarballs for the dtv-scan-tables aren't 
being generated properly. The 'LATEST' appears to be correct, but there 
is only one dated one, no new ones. If you have a few minutes, can you 
see what's going on?

Secondly, I guess we are way past the year marker, how do you feel the 
dtv-scan-tables are handled? I hope it is all satisfactory still?

Olliver
