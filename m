But how? Buffers are added onto the list in omap1_videobuf_queue() under 
spin_lock_irqsave(); and there you also check ->ready and fill it in. In 
your completion you set ->ready = NULL, but then also call 
prepare_next_vb() to get the next buffer from the list - if there are any, 
so, how can it be NULL with a non-empty list?

Yeah, up to you, I'd say, but if you decide to keep them in the header, 
please, use a namespace.

I'm satisfied with your answers to the rest of my questions / comments:)
