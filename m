3 new linux backports release are now available based on linux-next
tags next-20140320 [0] next-20140411 [1] and next-20140417 [2]. This
should mean that we can keep things in synch now almost daily, and
drivers can be tested with the latest code as-is on linux-next. We've
shaved off kernel support for kernels older than 3.0 in order to help
scale the project. We've also have added 2 new SmPL patches to help
backports backport two pain in the ass collateral evolutions
automatically. Please note that the patches/ directory is now all
tidied up -- folks interested in playing with SmPL can try to help by
seeing if they can use SmPL grammer to formalize a collateral
evolution backport. We have a bit of examples now. For more details
please refer to the wiki [3] or git tree.
