Well, I just tried, and failed to reproduce those kernel log messages.
There is a comment in one of the source file about "spammy" messages
that show up if there is mismatch between the actual and expected
video standards. I don't think I had them mismatched before, but maybe
I did. Or maybe after all my mucking around I had managed to get the
adapter in a weird state. So, for now, that patch seems to be all that
is needed.
