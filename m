the first right on GNU/Linux is to speak up freely for what you have.

After that, you can still have a lot of work for free too ...

Don't take the further personally, it is not meant as such,
but such stuff can go on for years.

If, after all known troubles on 2.6.4x and 2.6.5x, a distribution
chooses to introduce them again, without any feasible reason, the rule
is, they can only appear on our lists with their users for so much lines
they have contributed.

Else have to deal with it internally, since they caused it by ignoring
us, from where they all have from.

This is not enough, since such behavior also diminishes the count of the
few remaining testers we have, this is an active damage to the
community, and can only happen since v4l-dvb mostly is founded on
totally different guys like those on ubuntu and/or debian most active.
To have it said.

For my count, the noise is already far above anything acceptable within
that scale and all should go back home ... or use something else.

Cheers,
Hermann
