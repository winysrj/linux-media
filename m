Hello,

if you have card=112 tuner=61 auto detected something goes very wrong.

On any recent "official" code the card should be auto detected as
card=112, tuner=54, which is the tda8290 analog IF demodulator within
the saa7131e and behind its i2c gate is a tda8275ac1 at address 0x61
which is correct in your logs.

Hopefully you are only confusing tuner address 61 with tuner type,
auto detection should be OK then.

Analog TV is on the upper antenna connector (cable TV) and you need a
saa7134 insmod option "secam=L" in France. ("modinfo saa7134")
On La Corse may still be some "secam=Lc" broadcast, not sure about that.

DVB-T (numerique) is on the lower antenna connector where also is
radio/FM.

We have many reports that there often is an positive offset of about
166000Hz needed in France, which you don't seem to use on your digital
tuning attempt. If this is needed and missing, the tda10046 will fail.
You might try to add it.

Download dvb-apps from linuxtv.org mercurial and check if there is an
updated initial scan file for your region in scan/dvb-t.

example with offset:

T 810166000 8MHz 2/3 NONE QAM64 8k 1/32 NONE

You can also try to "scan" on a known frequency and bandwidth and set
the rest to AUTO AUTO ... or get "wscan" or try with "kaffeine".

You might also try to increase the tuning timeout.

Good Luck,

Hermann
