OK. In addition to CI support and remote controller there was also 
.read_mac_address() callback implemented for TechnoTrend. But as 
.read_mac_address() is heavily optional and useless it could be possible 
driver author just left it unimplemented for PCTV - or PCTV does not has 
MAC address.

You seems to be marked as a one module author, I can guess you know reason?

Also if you has hardware, could you make some tests in order to get that 
driver fixed :]
