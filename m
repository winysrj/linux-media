I just *thought* about it, I never said I would do it! :-)

I don't like this as this means some applications will compile on 64 bit or
with a non-y2038-aware libc, but fail on a 32-bit with y2038-aware libc. This
will be confusing and it may take a long time before the application developer
discovers this.

This would work.

Right, and if we do that we still have the problem I describe under a). So we
would need to implement b) regardless.

In other words, choosing c) doesn't depend on y2038 and it should be decided
on its own merits.

I've proposed this as a topic to the media workshop we'll have during the Linux
Kernel Summit.
