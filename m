I'm not sure, otherwise I would have proposed more precise functions :-)

Two of the entities just apply look up tables. They can thus be used for 
various purpose, such as gamma correction, A-law/µ-law (de)compression, ...

The last entity is an interface between the VSP and the display device and 
just handles buffering, clock domain crossing and synchronization.

I'd consider that as video format conversion, yes.

The three entities that implement this function in the vsp1 driver are 
ARGB8888 <-> AHSV8888 converters and RGB <-> YUV converters (with various RGB 
and YUV formats supported).

I would consider them as scaling, yes. Sakari, any opinion on that ?
