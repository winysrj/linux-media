The patch that made the problem obvious for ARM is
309caa9cc6ff39d261264ec4ff10e29489afc8f8 aka v2.6.36-rc1~591^2~2^4~12.
So this went in before v2.6.36-rc1.  One of the "architectures which
similar restrictions" is x86 BTW.

And no, we won't revert 309caa9cc6ff39d261264ec4ff10e29489afc8f8 as it
addresses a hardware restriction.

Best regards
Uwe
