Maybe you already have seen, but I did some initial stuff year or two 
ago for implementing that but left it unimplemented as there was so much 
stuff to check and discuss in order to agree correct solution.

http://www.mail-archive.com/linux-media@vger.kernel.org/msg38840.html

There is regmap which maybe could do stuff like that, I am not sure as I 
never tested it. At least it could do some stuff top of I2C bus.

Also I heavily disagree you what goes to I2C subsystem integration. That 
is clearly stuff which resides top of I2C bus and it is *not bus 
dependent*. There is many other buses too having similar splitting logic 
like SPI?

Just to mention, there is existing framework for GPIO I2C.
