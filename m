Well, Terratec are more helpful than most vendors, so that might not be
a bad choice.  Did you see http://linux.terratec.de/ ?

I'm afraid your card isn't there, but...

This card is supported by the tm6000 driver currently in staging:

bjorn@canardo:~$ grep 00A5 /usr/local/src/git/linux-2.6/drivers/staging/tm6000/*
/usr/local/src/git/linux-2.6/drivers/staging/tm6000/tm6000-cards.c:     { USB_DEVICE(0x0ccd, 0x00A5), .driver_info = TM6010_BOARD_TERRATEC_CINERGY_HYBRID_XE },

You may want to try that.  I have no idea how well it works, if at all...
