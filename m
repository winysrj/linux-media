This was just a quick TODO list provided by Sakari, These code was being
targeted for media folder itself and not staging. This code is well
tested on DM365
EVM. The TODO list might be looking long but trust me this would be
fixed up quickly.

This is pretty much similar as OMAP3isp driver. The current driver is based
on V4l2 lacking major features such as ipipe, and resizing. The new driver
which has being added uses the Media controller framewrok, uses videobuf2,
supports ipipe and resizing driver and obvious advantages  of media controller
framework. If driver with these new features and enhancement doesn't make into
just because taking into mind of the users of old driver.

This is something similar like you have videobuf and videobuf2. But
there were no
incremental patches for videobuf itself, but it was added new. But now
there is rule
for users writing a new driver should write using videobuf2 only, so
that slowly videobuf
phases of, Similarly the users will need to be encouraged to use the new drivers
with such a huge list of features in new driver and slowly phase of
the old driver.
