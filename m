Hi,

staring with kernel 4.1 the tevii S650 usb box is not working any more, 
last working version was 4.0.

TheÂ  bug was also reported here 
https://www.spinics.net/lists/linux-media/msg121356.html

I found a solution for it and uploaded a patch to the kernel bugzilla.

See here: https://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=197731

Can somebody of the maintainers have a look on it and apply the patch to 
the kernes sources?

Light
