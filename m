Greetings of the day to you. It is understandable that you might be a
little bit apprehensive because you do not know me but I have a lucrative
business proposal of mutual interest to share with you. . I got your
reference in my search for someone who suits my proposed business
relationship.

Let me start by introducing myself. I am Mr. Patrick K. W. Chan Executive
Director & Chief financial Officer of Hang Seng Bank Ltd. I have an
obscured business suggestion for you.

I will need you to assist me in executing a business project from Hong
Kong to your country. It involves the transfer of a large sum of money.
Everything concerning this transaction shall be legally done without
hitch. Please endeavour to observe utmost discretion in all matters
concerning this issue.

Once the funds have been successfully transferred into your account, we
shall share in the ratio to be agreed by both of us. Should you be
interested send the following details to kick-start the process;

Full name
