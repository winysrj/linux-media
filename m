Yeah exactly. At least with i915 we'd really want to be able to share
stolen memory in some cases, and since that's stolen there's no struct
pages for them. On top of that any cpu access is also blocked to that
range in the memory controller, so the dma_addr_t is really the _only_
thing you can use to get at those memory ranges. And afaik the camera pipe
on intel soc can get there - unfortunately that one doesn't have an
upstream driver :(

And just to clarify: All current dma-buf exporter that I've seen implement
the sg mapping correctly and _do_ map the sg table into device address
space with dma_map_sg. In other words: The dma_addr_t are all valid, it's
just that e.g. with ttm no one has bothered to teach ttm a dma-buf
correctly. The internal abstraction is all there, ttm-internal buffer
object interface match what dma-buf exposes fairly closes (hey I didn't do
shit when designing those interfaces ;-)
