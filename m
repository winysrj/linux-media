Yeah, that makses sense.

No, sorry. The Documentation/devicetree/bindings/leds/common.txt
describes binding for _one LED_. Yes, your device can have two leds,
so your devices should have two such blocks in the device tree... Each
led should have its own label and default trigger, for example. And I
guess flash-timeout be per-LED, too.

Would it make sense to include "-uA" and "-usec" suffixes in the dt
property names?

Yes, that would work. I have used

+               max-flash-timeout-usec = <500000>;
+               max-flash-intensity-uA     = <320000>;
+               max-torch-intensity-uA     =  <50000>;
+               max-indicator-intensity-uA =  <17500>;

. Which is pretty similar. (Actually, maybe the longer property names
are easier to understand for more people?) (And yes, I should probably
separate red and white led into separate groups).

Thanks for cc and thanks for links!

I see max77693 has two different "white" leds, aat1290 has one "white"
led, and neither of them has secondary red led for indication?

Thanks for the links. It seems that aside from moving adp1653 driver
to device tree, it should be moved to the LED framework, but that's a
topic for another patch.

Best regards,
