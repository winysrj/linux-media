Hi Maarten,

I cannot help a lot on this patch set, but there are a few things that
I noticed when reading it.

I think the entire description should go into a file in the Documentation
directory, to make it easier to find without looking up the git history.

For the purpose of documenting this, it feels a little strange to
talk about "buffers" here. Obviously this is what you are using the
locks for, but it sounds like that is not the only possible use
case.

Since the user always has to check the return value, would it be
possible to provide only the interruptible kind of this function
but not the non-interruptible one? In general, interruptible locks
are obviously harder to use, but they are much user friendlier when
something goes wrong.

Are these meant to be used a lot? If not, maybe prefix them with __mutex_
instead of mutex_.

Have you considered changing the meaning of the "count" member
of the mutex in the case where a ticket mutex is used? That would
let you use an unmodified structure.
