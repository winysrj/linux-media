Hello

Some of the people from this list will be in Dublin the next week for
the ELCE, unfortunately, this year we will not have the linux-media
summit, because it will be in Korea.

Anyway, I think that it can be a great idea to meet in Dublin and have
dinner together.

At least these people will be in Dublin:

Hans Verlkuil: 2-10 october
Nicolas Dufresne: 2-10 october
Ricardo Ribalda: 3-10 october


Date: Hans has proposed the dates 4th  (sunday) or 6th.  The 6th is
the Technical Showcase and I believe that there will be some food
involved.

Location: I assume most of us will have their room close to the
conference, so we can find out a place close by. Any Dublin local in
the list that can recommend a place?

Looking forward to meet you!
