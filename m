Subject: [PATCH 0/3] Introduce DMA buffer sharing mechanism

Hello Everyone,

Post some discussion as an RFC, here is the patch for introducing 
DMA buffer sharing mechanism - change history is in the changelog below.

Various subsystems - V4L2, GPU-accessors, DRI to name a few - have felt the 
need to have a common mechanism to share memory buffers across different
devices - ARM, video hardware, GPU.

This need comes forth from a variety of use cases including cameras, image 
processing, video recorders, sound processing, DMA engines, GPU and display
buffers, amongst others.

This patch attempts to define such a buffer sharing mechanism - it is the
result of discussions from a couple of memory-management mini-summits held by
Linaro to understand and address common needs around memory management. [1]

A new dma_buf buffer object is added, with operations and API to allow easy
sharing of this buffer object across devices.

The framework allows:
- a new buffer object to be created with fixed size, associated with a file 
   pointer and allocator-defined operations for this buffer object. This
   operation is called the 'export' operation.
- different devices to 'attach' themselves to this buffer object, to facilitate
   backing storage negotiation, using dma_buf_attach() API.
- this exported buffer object to be shared with the other entity by asking for
   its 'file-descriptor (fd)', and sharing the fd across.
- a received fd to get the buffer object back, where it can be accessed using
   the associated exporter-defined operations.
- the exporter and user to share the buffer object's scatterlist using
   map_dma_buf and unmap_dma_buf operations.

Documentation present in the patch-set gives more details.

For 1st version, dma-buf is marked as an EXPERIMENTAL driver, which we can
remove for later versions with additional usage and testing.

*IMPORTANT*: [see https://lkml.org/lkml/2011/12/20/211 for more details]
For this first version, A buffer shared using the dma_buf sharing API:
- *may* be exported to user space using "mmap" *ONLY* by exporter, outside of
   this framework.
- may be used *ONLY* by importers that do not need CPU access to the buffer.

This is based on design suggestions from many people at the mini-summits,
most notably from Arnd Bergmann <arnd@arndb.de>, Rob Clark <rob@ti.com> and
Daniel Vetter <daniel@ffwll.ch>.

The implementation is inspired from proof-of-concept patch-set from
Tomasz Stanislawski <t.stanislaws@samsung.com>, who demonstrated buffer sharing
between two v4l2 devices. [2]

Some sample implementations and WIP for dma-buf users and exporters are
available at [3] and [4]. [These are not being submitted for discussion /
inclusion right now, but are for reference only]
