so as I understand it, nobody is against dropping the double-linkage
*if* we can agree on a way to recreate the backlinks in the kernel.
My current suggestion would be to parse the complete device tree into an
internal graph structure once, at boot to achieve this. This code could
look for the optional 'ports' node if and only if the parent device node
contains #address-cells != <1> or #size-cells != <0> properties.

People completely disagree about the direction the phandle links should
point in. I am still of the opinion that the generic binding should
describe just the topology, that the endpoint links in the kernel should
represent an undirected graph and the direction of links should not
matter at all for the generic graph bindings.

There's also no consensus about the simplified bindings, but this is an
issue I'd like to separate from this series.

I'm not sure if maybe I misunderstood or missed a mail, but I haven't
seen a proposal to resolve the situation without rewinds. Given that
Mauro already reverted the media tree and applied conflicting changes,
that's probably not going to happen?
