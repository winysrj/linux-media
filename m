You've mentioned that your white led is torch/flash and indicator
is the red led. They are probably connected to the HPLED and
ILED pins of the ADP1653 device respectively. The device is just
a regulator, that delivers electric current to the leds connected
to it. Kernel cannot directly activate leds, but has to talk
to the device through I2C bus. One I2C device can have only one
related device tree binding.

default-trigger is not mandatory, the device doesn't have to have
associated led-trigger. I think that you should look at
Documentation/leds/leds-class.txt and drivers/leds/triggers for
more detailed information. In a nutshell triggers are kernel
sources of led events. You can set e.g. "heartbeat", "timer"
trigger etc.
As for now the driver belongs to the V4L2 subsystem it doesn't
support triggers. Moreover your event "we are recording a video"
should be activated by setting V4L2_CID_FLASH_INDICATOR_INTENSITY
v4l2 control followed by V4L2_FLASH_LED_MODE_TORCH. Your event
"this is flash for default camera" seems to be flash strobe,
that can be activated by setting V4L2_CID_FLASH_STROBE control.
The driver by default sets the indicator current for both actions
to the value previously set with V4L2_CID_FLASH_INDICATOR_INTENSITY.

I think that you are talking about sub nodes. Indeed I am leaning
towards this type of design.

OK, I agree.

Right, I missed that the leds/common.txt describes child node.

I propose following modifications to the binding:

Optional properties for child nodes:
- iout-mode-led : 	maximum intensity in microamperes of the LED
		  	(torch LED for flash devices)
- iout-mode-flash : 	initial intensity in microamperes of the
			flash LED; it is required to enable support
			for the flash led
- iout-mode-indicator : initial intensity in microamperes of the
			indicator LED; it is required to enable support
			for the indicator led
- max-iout-mode-led : 	maximum intensity in microamperes of the LED
		  	(torch LED for flash devices)
- max-iout-mode-flash : maximum intensity in microamperes of the
			flash LED
- max-iout-mode-indicator : maximum intensity in microamperes of the
			indicator LED
- flash-timeout :	timeout in microseconds after which flash
			led is turned off

system-status {
         label = "max77693_1";
         iout-mode-led = <500>;
         max-iout-mode-led = <500>;
         ...
};

camera-flash1 {
         label = "max77693_2";
         iout-mode-led = <500>;
         iout-mode-flash = <1000>;
	iout-mode-indicator = <100>;
         max-iout-mode-led = <500>;
         max-iout-mode-flash = <1000>;
         max-iout-mode-indicator = <100>;
         flash-timeout = <1000>;
         ...
};


I propose to avoid name "torch", as for ordinary leds it would
be misleading.

Jacek
