I have the card since alsmost 3 years, it never worked, but now i'm in 
urgent need of getting an analog usb stick to work with Linux.

The PCTV hybrid:

Bus 001 Device 004: ID eb1a:2881 eMPIA Technology, Inc.

Thanks for you support, but i need an analog usb stick, well hopefully 
the wintv 900H will get supported soon.
