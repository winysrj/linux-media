Hi All,

Need to write the Sensor driver. I have the below doubts:

1. What are the dependencies between the bridge driver and Sensor driver?
2. To write the sensor driver, what are the things, we need to look in
bridge driver?
3. What are the Sensor driver functions called from bridge driver.
4 . What are the things the bridge driver expect from Sensor driver?


Thanks & Regards
