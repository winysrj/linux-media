To your utter disappointment as i should say, i am not working for any
vendor, but just get device support out to the community.

The jusst.de domain is owned by Julian Scheel who runs Jusst
Technologies, just happened to offer me hosting for me repositories for
my work, using full ssh access, so that my workflow is easier.

Not that i have anything to do with jusst.de otherwise. OTOH, i do have
the patches at kernel.org

Maybe Julian can comment on this to make things more clearer on the
financial interests.

I am not manipulating any timing of multiproto being merged. In fact i
had been away, for a few months due to certain reasons, that you are
perfectly aware by now as far as i can understand. So the points that
you raise are quite baseless.

Crap, just read above.

I don't have to do any mud-slinging, just wrote the exact facts out here.
