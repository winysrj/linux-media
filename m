Sakari and I will spend time on the long-awaited media controller library in a couple of weeks, I hope to have results to present during the summit.

Depending on the audience, I would also be interested in getting feedback from SoC vendors who are not (yet) active in the V4L2 community on our approach and how we could best help them. This could include discussions about Android, as I believe we need to push V4L2 on that platform. Guennadi's recent work on an Android V4L2 camera library is a good first step in that direction.
