Subject: [PATCH 0/9] vp702x: get rid of on-stack dma buffers (part2 1/2)

Hi!

This is a patchset modifying the vp702x to get rid of on-stack dma buffers
and additionally preallocating the used buffers on device probe. 

I can not test these patches, as I don't have the hardware.
They compile though...
I made it a bit more finegrained for easier review.

If someone could test these, that would be appreciated.

I have a few more patches to dib0700 and gp8psk to also use a 
preallocated buffer, but I'm not shure the added complexity is 
worth it. So I'm waiting on feedback to the vp702x to proceed.

I have another batch of patches to opera1, m920x, dw2102, friio,
a800 which I did not modify since my first patch submission.

Regards,
Flo
