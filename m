Many thanks for taking the driver this far!

However, I feel that there's still some work to do, especially in the user
space API. Some things could be implemented using the generic API but
currently use davinci-specific API; private IOCTL is being used where
controls would do, and resizing is enabled or disable explicitly in ipipeif
configuration. Also, there are things such as internal clock frequencies
visible in the API.

I can go to more details soon after taking a closer look at the patches.

If you wish to get this to mainline kernel fast, a viable option IMO would
be the staging tree.

What do you think?

Cc Hans and Laurent.
