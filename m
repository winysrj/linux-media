After digging in the code for hours, I'm giving this up. It's not worth it.

The ISOC_MODE_YUV422 mode works as V4L2_PIX_FMT_YVYU with VLC and 
mplayer+libv4lconvert, reducing the loop (and dropping strech_*) in 
usbvision_parse_lines_422() to:
 scratch_get(usbvision, frame->data + (frame->v4l2_linesize * frame->curline),
 2 * frame->frmwidth);

The ISOC_MODE_YUV420 is some weird custom format with 64-byte lines of YYUV. 
usbvision_parse_lines_420() is real mess with that scratch_* crap everywhere.

ISOC_MODE_COMPRESS: There are callbacks to usbvision_request_intra() and also 
usbvision_adjust_compression(). This is not going to work outside the kernel.


So I can redo the conversion removal patch to keep the RGB formats and also 
provide another one to remove the testpattern (it oopses too). But I'm not 
going to do any major changes in the driver.
