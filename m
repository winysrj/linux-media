Two more items that need to be addressed in my opinion :

- Let's not export the ion_client API, we don't want drivers to be ion-
specific. Only the dma-buf interface should be visible to drivers.

- I haven't seen any proposal how a heap-based solution could be used in a 
generic distribution. This needs to be figured out before committing to any 
API/ABI.
