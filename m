Hello,

I would like to know if someone has already used the em28xx driver on a 
beagleboard xM
(the connected device is a Dazzle DVC 100)

I have tried with an Angstrom Narcissus image and a Debian but I still 
get "select timeouts" and skipped frames with mencoded or the capture.c 
sample

Thanks in advance,

Regards,
Chris
