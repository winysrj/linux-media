As Hans answered this option disables the IP stack from the DVB driver. The
IP stack is part of the DVB standard. It is used, for example, by automatic 
firmware updates used on STB's. It can also be used to access the Internet,
via the DVB card, if the network provider supports it.

Before 3.0, this were enabled on all cards. However, if the IP stack is
disabled, this would mean that the entire DVB would also be disabled.
So, this option were added. It may make sense to make it dependent of
CONFIG_EMBEDDED, as normal users should not need to disable it.

Feel free to send us a patch if you want to improve the Kconfig logic or
help message.

Thanks,
Mauro
