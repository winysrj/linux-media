Can you explain?

adp1653 is independend device on i2c bus, and we have kernel driver
for it (unlike rest of n900 camera system). Just now it is unusable
due to lack of DT binding. It has two functions, LED light and a
camera flash; yes, the second one should be integrated to the rest of
camera system, but that is not yet merged. That should not prevent us
from merging DT support for the flash, so that this part can be
tested/maintained.

I have seen that.
