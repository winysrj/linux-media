Just to chime in here, parisc has an identical issue.  If the CPU ever
sees an alias with different attributes for the same page, it will HPMC
the box (that's basically the bios will kill the system as being
architecturally inconsistent), so an architecture neutral solution on
this point is essential to us as well.

So this would require that systems using the API have a highmem? (parisc
doesn't today).

I assume from the above that ARM has a hardware page walker?

The way I'd fix this on parisc, because we have a software based TLB, is
to rely on the fact that a page may only be used either for DMA or for
Page Cache, so the aliases should never be interleaved.  Since you know
the point at which the page flips from DMA to Cache (and vice versa),
I'd purge the TLB entry and flush the page at that point and rely on the
usage guarantees to ensure that the alias TLB entry doesn't reappear.
This isn't inexpensive but the majority of the cost is the cache flush
which is a requirement to clean the aliases anyway (a TLB entry purge is
pretty cheap).

Would this work for the ARM hardware walker as well?  It would require
you to have a TLB entry purge instruction as well as some architectural
guarantees about not speculating the TLB.
