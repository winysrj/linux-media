Answering my own question, Krzysztof already replied about
this on another thread:

http://www.spinics.net/lists/linux-media/msg91470.html

Quoting him:

""
These (tw686x) chips aren't ideal - but they work.
For example, in DMA SG mode, they can't produce a single continuous
interlaced frame in memory - they can only make two separate fields.
A limitation of their DMA engine, since in non-SG mode they can make
(pseudo)-progressive frames.
