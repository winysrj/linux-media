Hello,
I would like to experiment with / test some of the recent files /
patches that have been in development. Where are v4l development files
posted, in general? Is there a repository or mirror open to people
developing applications of the software? I have tried searching
Kernel.org for some of the files I was interested in, but didn't have
any luck. I may not be looking in the right places.
Specifically, I am interested in acquiring the soc_camera.c driver for
the PXA270 and its related files. Could someone direct me to a
repository or mirror that has what I might need so I am able to try it?
I have the patches in the e-mails (at least some of them), but I got a
little lost trying to follow them all due to various revisions.
Thank you for your help,
Fred Webber
