The empty function was added for a reason? The presence of a 
change_protocol function implies that the receiver supports protocol 
changing (whether it's via the raw IR decoding or in hardware).

change_protocol is only set if it's a driver that does in-kernel 
decoding...meaning that it generates pulse/space timings...meaning that 
hardware protocol changes aren't necessary?

First, enabled_protocols is already taken care of in the above patch 
(the line after "goto out_raw" is "dev->enabled_protocols = rc_type;")?

Second, initializing enabled_protocols to some default in 
ir_raw_event_register() might not be strictly necessary but it also 
doesn't hurt since that happens before dev->change_protocol() is called 
in rc_register_device()?

I'd prefer the above, minimal, approach. But it's Mauro who decides in 
the end.
