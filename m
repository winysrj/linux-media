You also need to make a 'lock' type for seqno, and lock it for lockdep purposes.
This will be a virtual lock that will only exist in lockdep, but it's needed for proper lockdep annotation.

See reservation_ticket_init/fini. It's also important that seqno must not be 0, ever.

The lockdep class for this lock must be the same for all reservations, and for maximum lockdep usability
you want all the buf->lock lockdep class for all objects across all devices to be the same too.

The __ticket_mutex_init in reservation_object_init does just that for you. :-)

Almost correct, you need to re-regrab buf->lock after unreserving all other buffers with mutex_reserve_lock_slow, then goto retry, and skip over this bo when doing the normal locking.

The difference between mutex_reserve_lock and mutex_reserve_lock_slow is that mutex_reserve_lock_slow will block indefinitely where mutex_reserve_lock would return -EAGAIN.
mutex_reserve_lock_slow does not return an error code. mutex_reserve_lock_intr_slow can return -EINTR if interrupted.

Yes, but strictly speaking it does not need to be called on slow path, it will do an atomic_xchg to set reservation_id,
see that it had already set reservation_id, and skip the rest. :-)

Maybe I should just return !__builtin_constant_p(reservation_id) in __mutex_lock_common to distinguish between fastpath and slowpath.
That would cause __mutex_lock_common to return 0 for normal mutexes, 1 when reservation_id is set and slowpath is used. This would
allow me to check whether mutex_set_reservation_fastpath needs to be called or not, and tighten up lockdep detection of mismatched
mutex_reserve_lock / mutex_lock with mutex_unlock / mutex_reserve_unlock.
