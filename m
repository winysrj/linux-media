The first problem, that appears in your image is geometry. There seem to 
be more pixels in the image than you think there are. Also, I don't know 
what your test image should look like, but I doubt it should be that pink. 
So, looks like you also wrongly decode pixels. Maybe these two problems 
are related - your bytes-per-pixel is wrong, so the width is wrong and the 
pixel format too.

Thanks
Guennadi
