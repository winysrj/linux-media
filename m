True ;)

Well, let's discuss it then. What's your proposal?

I guess there are actually some different goals that we want to archive
with "name":

1) an ideally short name used when displaying an entity on some graph. 
It would be good if such "short name" would be unique, but it won't
hurt much if such name is not unique;

2) an unique ID identifier that will likely take the position of an
entity inside the machine bus, like PCI ID, USB ID, I2C bus + I2C addr...

I guess such UID would be better addressed via properties, as it
would likely be constructed in userspace via a different set of
properties, depending on the device and/or bus type.

Ok. I'll change this on a later patch.

We had such discussion at the MC summit. I don't object to change to
__u64, but we need to reach a consensus ;)

It used to be __u32... Hans requested to change it to an struct.

Btw, I also prefer to use __u32 here ;)
