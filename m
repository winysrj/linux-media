That would also be very unfortunate because it means enabling CMA incurs
a performance cost to everyone whether they use CMA or not. For ARM,
this may not be a problem but it would be for other arches if they
wanted to use CMA or if it ever became part of a distro contig.

I'm not quite seeing this. In free_hot_cold_page(), the pageblock
type is checked so the page private should be set to MIGRATE_CMA or
MIGRATE_ISOLATE for the CMA area. It's not clear how this can change a
pageblock to MIGRATE_MOVABLE in error. If it turns out that you
absolutely have to call get_pageblock_migratetype() from
free_pcppages_bulk() and my alternative suggestion did not work out then
document all these issues in a comment when putting the call under
CONFIG_CMA so that it is not forgotten.
