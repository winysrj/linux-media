At least this list doesn't shoot you for top-posting like that, I've 
seen some nasty threads about something so trivial ;)

I'm a bit confused: Why are people blaming Manu for this one?
His API got shot down, why (and this is not a rhetorical question) do 
people expect so much from him this time?

And hasn't he already signed of on his drivers to be in the v4l repository?
