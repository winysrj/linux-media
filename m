Good to hear that now everything nailed down.
So, the patch
  https://patchwork.linuxtv.org/patch/53128/
is needed in addition to 
  https://patchwork.linuxtv.org/patch/53044/
?

If so, Mauro, please don't forget to put Fixes and stable tags, so
that both will be backported to stable trees.

Meanwhile I'll backport it to openSUSE kernels so that the issue will
be fixed in the next kernel update.


Thanks!

Takashi
