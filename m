IMO decisions must be made where the community is, i.e. on the mailing
list. Not at a conference, no matter whether it is at one end of the
world or on the dark side of the moon. ;-(

To make it absolutely clear: 
I did not leave _because_ S2API was selected.
I left because it was done _this_way_.

Good for those, who are fine with these methods. I am not.

I consider flame wars ridiculous. I did not participate, and I will not
participate in the future.

I believe that I know very well what is going on. (During more than 30
years in software development I have seen all kinds of problems. I know
how people react and why things happen.)
