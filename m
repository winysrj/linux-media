yes, this is the idea..  possibly some room for some helpers to help
out with this, but that is all under the hood from userspace
perspective

well, the point I'm trying to make, is by dividing your constraints
into two groups, one that impacts and is handled by userspace, and one
that is in the kernel (ie. where the pages go), you cut down the
number of permutations that the kernel has to care about considerably.
 And kernel already cares about, for example, what range of addresses
that a device can dma to/from.  I think really the only thing missing
is the max # of sglist entries (contiguous or not)

I tend to think it is better to add helpers as we see common patterns
emerge, which drivers can opt-in to using.  I don't think that we
should move allocation into dma_buf itself, but it would perhaps be
useful to have dma_alloc_*() variants that could allocate for multiple
devices.  That would help for simple stuff, although I'd suspect
eventually a GPU driver will move away from that.  (Since you probably
want to play tricks w/ pools of pages that are pre-zero'd and in the
correct cache state, use spare cycles on the gpu or dma engine to
pre-zero uncached pages, and games like that.)

keep in mind, even a number of SoC's come with pcie these days.  You
already have things like

  https://developer.nvidia.com/content/kayla-platform

You probably want to get out of the SoC mindset, otherwise you are
going to make bad assumptions that come back to bite you later on.

not really.. it just knows it wants to scanout the buffer, and tells
this as a hint to the kernel.

For example, on omapdrm, the SCANOUT flag does nothing on omap4+
(where phys contig is not required for scanout), but causes CMA
(dma_alloc_*()) to be used on omap3.  Userspace doesn't care.  It just
knows that it wants to be able to scanout that particular buffer.

Right.. and not actually even possible in the general sense (see SoC +
external pcie gfx card)
