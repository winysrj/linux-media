I know.

But with the proposed API userspace would have to first try to send a 
scancode + protocol, then see what the error code was, and if it 
indicated that the kernel couldn't encode the scancode, userspace would 
anyway have to encode it itself and then try again with raw events?

I think that's a bad API (to put it mildly).

There's simply no need to encode the scancodes in kernel (even if the 
code happens to be present for a random and fluctuating set of 
protocols) and any well-written userspace would have to include code to 
encode to any protocol it wants to support (since it can't rely on the 
kernel supporting any given protocol)....what does that buy you except a 
hairy API and added complexity?
