Hi
I don't have this card, but I have some other hauppauge cards.

What is meant by analogue support?

>From my perspective I understand if TV analogue is dropping priority but
for me the Composite/Svideo analogue on Hauppauge cards is more
important - since I use them to hook up to my Satellite boxes.

Do you count that as analogue too?

Thanks
