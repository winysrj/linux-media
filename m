OK, thanks for the advice.

So I built them both as modules and planned to try both, pciehp only and acpiphp only. However, I've found that acpiphp will not load (regardless of whether or not pciehp is already loaded).

OK, thanks again for the advice. I've disabled the acpiphp driver.

Mmm, that's odd because I dual-boot Windows 7 on this laptop and when I 
plug it in under Windows 7, it appears in Device Manager and works 
perfectly.

/sys/bus/pci/slots is empty:

[chris:~]$ ls -l /sys/bus/pci/slots/
total 0

Using Google, I find that the acpi slot detection driver should populate 
that directory. It is configured in and built into the kernel 
statically, so I don't know what's happening there.

By the way, there is also /sys/bus/pci_express directory:

[chris:~]$ ls -Rl /sys/bus/pci_express/
