How do you want me to split patches? I propose following:
1. one patch to add all compatibles to DT binding documentation
2. one patch to add A31 compatible to driver
3. one patch for all 32 bit SoCs DT changes
4. one patch to add A64 compatible
5. one patch to enable OrangePi Win IR node

I don't think it's sensible to have multiple patches (one per SoC) for step 1 
and 3.

Best regards,
Jernej
