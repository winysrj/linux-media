What a plain nonsense.

Mauro did never block any of your work.

You have been blocked by the "dvb maintainers", and Mauro was excluded
from them and had no authorization to deal with your patches concerning
dvb.

You have been pointed to deal with the few remaining dvb issues with
Oliver, he was backed by Johannes and there was no more noise from Manu
or Mike.

Instead you preferred, and I told you not to do it, to put an ultimatum
on Mauro, to pull in, IIRC, all your 79 patches over the weekend or you
would do something cruel.

Getting it sick,
Hermann
