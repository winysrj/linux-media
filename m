Those functions are inside the "#if 0", so the compiler never sees them.

Because the final Makefile is generated by a script, I didn't think
you actually could address it at the "make prepare" phase.  That said,
now I see that I could have patched
linux/drivers/media/vl2-core/Makefile as you suggested.

I don't have time to regenerate/resubmit at this point.  Take the
patch if you want it, feel free to recreate the patch slightly
differently with no discernible benefit, or eventually I will get
around to it the next time I'm working on that tree.

Cheers,

Devin
