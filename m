I would prefer having the frame sequence number here. It will be more
future proof IMHO. If for instance we decide to use such an ioctl on
a v4l2 sub-device, without dequeuing buffers, there will be no problem
with that. And still in your specific use case it's not big deal to
look up the buffer index given it's sequence number in the application.

I meant exactly the line implying the range. What if for some hardware
it's 0..11 ?

1..100 might be better, to minimize rounding errors. Nevertheless IMO if we
can export an exact range supported by FD device we should do it, and let
upper layers do the normalization. And the bigger numbers should mean higher
confidence, consistently for all devices.

Do you think we could assume that the FD threshold range (FD_LHIT register
in case of OMAP4) is always same as the result confidence level ?

If so then the confidence level range could possibly be queried with the
detection threshold control. We could name it V4L2_CID_FD_CONFIDENCE_THRESHOLD
for example.
I could take care of preparing the control class draft and the documentation
for it.

How about changing name of this structure to v4l2_fd_primitive or v4l2_fd_shape ?

OK, in any way I suggest to replace all __u16 with __u32, to minimize performance
issues and be consistent with the data type specifying pixel values elsewhere in
V4L.
It makes sense to make 'confidence' __u32 as well and add a flags attribute to
indicate the shape.

And then
	  __u32           reserved[10];

or
	  __u32           reserved[2];

Do you think we could change it to:

#define V4L2_FD_FL_LEFT_EYE	(1 << 0)
#define V4L2_FD_FL_RIGHT_EYE	(1 << 1)
#define V4L2_FD_FL_MOUTH	(1 << 2)
#define V4L2_FD_FL_FACE		(1 << 3)

and add:

#define V4L2_FD_FL_SMILE	(1 << 4)
#define V4L2_FD_FL_BLINK	(1 << 5)

:) also the word return could be omitted.

How about changing the name to v4l2_fd_object ?

OK, and how about this:

 	struct v4l2_fd_object {
 		struct v4l2_fd_shape	left_eye;
 		struct v4l2_fd_shape	right_eye;
 		struct v4l2_fd_shape	mouth;
 		struct v4l2_fd_shape	face;
		__u32			reserved[33];	
 		__u32   		flags;
	} __packed;

?
