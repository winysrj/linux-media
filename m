What is the definition of this "secured" area?

According to you it's perfectly ok to decrypt multiple streams with one =

cam... but only if it is with the correct, approved, hardware?

In essence, this is a shortcomming of the TT hardware, can we really =

tell people not to fix it using software because it'll break some =

ridiculous IP law, or whatever?
