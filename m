I think that a device tree binding describes a single physical device.
No matter how many sub-leds a device controls, it is still one
piece of hardware.
default-trigger property should also be an array of strings.
I agree that flash-timeout should be per led - an array, similarly
as in case of iout's.

I don't see this type of naming anywhere. The documentation should
contain the information about units. Nonetheless I am not a device tree
specialist, so an opinion of the relevant maintainer will be welcome.

Documentation of a binding should provide sufficient explanation
for the people to understand what a property is for.
And I would stay by arrays as argued above.

You're right.

Like I mentioned in the previous message the LED Flash class patch
isn't in its final shape yet. Nonetheless I think that we should
agree on the leds/common.txt documentation improvements and
define DT documentation for adp1653 accordingly.
