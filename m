E.g. you send the decode commands in decode order to the UVD block and if you have overlay active one of the frames are going to be the first to display and then you want to wait for it on the display side.

Yeah, I guess in the end we might end up having a pile of different
memory-based (shared through dma-bufs) based fences. But imo getting this
thing of the ground is more important, and you can always do crazy
per-platform/generation/whatever hacks and match on that specific fence
type in the interim. That'll cut it for the SoC madness, which also seems
to be what google does with the android syncpoint stuff.
