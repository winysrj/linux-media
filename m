The problem of finding a PAD is not specific for DT-based devices.
So, what we need is a generic way to find a pad.

The non-DT based drivers usually don't implement subdev API. So, they
need to build the pipelines themselves. On such devices, there are
hundreds of different combinations of devices, and the main driver
needs to seek the hardware connected into it. Based on such
runtime knowledge, setup the pipelines.

One such example is em28xx with can use a wide range of different 
tuners, analog TV decoders and digital TV frontends.

The I2C devices like tuners and decoders have pads with different
signals:
	- RF 
	- digital video (encoded with ITU-R BT.656 or similar)
	- audio IF signal
	- chroma IF signal
	- baseband signal
	- luminance IF signal
	- digital audio (using I2S)
	- composite video
	- ...

Right now, this is "solved" by using enums at include/media/v4l2-mc.h,
like this one:

enum tuner_pad_index {
	TUNER_PAD_RF_INPUT,
	TUNER_PAD_OUTPUT,
	TUNER_PAD_AUD_OUT,
	TUNER_NUM_PADS
};

That's not optimal, as even tuners that don't provide, for example,
an audio output pad need to have an unconnected TUNER_PAD_AUD_OUT
pad [1].

[1] With the current model, we're using TUNER_PAD_AUD_OUT for both
IF and digital audio - as currently - drivers don't need to distinguish
and we didn't want to have an excessive number of unconnected PADs.

So, what we really need is a way to represent a set of properties
associated with pads, and a function that would seek for a PAD that
matches a property set.

There is a proposal from Sakari to have a properties API that would
allow such kind of association (among others) and would even let
export such properties to userspace, but he never had time to send
us patches adding such functionality.

- 

IMHO, what we should do, instead of the approach you took, would be
to create a list of properties associated with each PAD (or, actually,
to any graph object, as we may want later to have properties also for
entities, interfaces and links). Something like:

enum media_property_type {
	MEDIA_PROP_PAD_DT_PORT_REG,	// not sure if this is the best name
	MEDIA_PROP_PAD_DT_REG,	// not sure if this is the best name
	MEDIA_PROP_PAD_SIGNAL_TYPE,	// that's for the above example of identifying a pad based on the signal it carries: I2S, RF, IF, ...
	...
};

struct media_properties {
	enum media_property_type type;
	int value;

	struct list_head *list;
};

struct media_graph {
	struct {
		struct media_entity *entity;
		struct list_head *link;
	} stack[MEDIA_ENTITY_ENUM_MAX_DEPTH];

	struct media_entity_enum ent_enum;
	int top;

	struct list_head *props; /* head for struct media_properties */
};

and a generic media_find_property() function that would allow a
driver to seek for an specific set of properties, e. g.:

int find_find_property(struct media_properties *props, struct media_graph *gobj);

This way, if someone would need to seek for an specific set of
properties (like on your DT case), he could use a helper function like
(untested):

find_dt_reg(int _port_reg, int _reg, struct media_graph *gobj)
{
	struct media_properties port_reg, reg;

	port_reg.type =	MEDIA_PROP_DT_PORT_REG;
	port_reg.value = _port_reg;

	reg.type = MEDIA_PROP_DT_REG;
	reg.value = _reg;

	INIT_LIST_HEAD(&port_reg->list);
	list_add_tail(&port->list, &reg);

	find_find_property(&port_reg, gobj);
}


Thanks,
Mauro
