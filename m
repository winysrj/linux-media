Hi there,

I guess IÂ´m about to have every TDA10023 based card, just to find that 
none of them works right with my provider... 

I tried with a C-1501 hoping that the new patch (from the thread 
"Locking issues on 388Mhz") could also solve my problem. Well... it 
didnt. Using the scan utility to scan for channels on 309 and 321 Mhz 
frequencies returns nothing. Other frequencies (like 129, 135, 585) 
works right. I also found this on dmesg:

[   75.377597] saa7146 (0) saa7146_i2c_writeout [irq]: timed out
waiting for end of xfer

May someone help me with this? I can provide ssh access to the machine, 
and/or donate a card to the developer (you can choose: C-1501, knc-1 or 
cablestar HD2). Until now, the only card that worked was a twinhan CAB-
CI.
