I think you do net get me right. I'm not blaming one person.
I blame the whohle DVB-S2 thing and the developers involved in.
You immedialey shoot, start thinking. It's not the fault of one
person. The mess is the fault of a group of persons. The only
thing i see on this ML is when criticism come up some people here
can't deal with it. That shows me verry little skills in dealing
with criticism and dealing with users and developers. Try to find
a solution and not blaming this or that person. One intresting point
on this ML is, that flames starting realy fast and are mostly
personal and more than rude. And most of the time there is no
technical solution discussion, only flaming and shooting.
