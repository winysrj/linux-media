Subject: [linux-dvb] HVR4000 Update?

> 
> Hey All,
> 
> Well it still seems to me that the Multi-Proto mess is still impacting real
> World use of cards such as the HVR4000. I'm currently using Ubuntu 7.10, and
> have still not managed much from my HVR4k apart from the main DVB-S channels
> on Astra 28.2e. I use Myth as my Media Server, and have no access to DVB-T
> or DVB-S2 channels. I read there are patches to make this poss, but there is
> such a muddle of info I am totally unsure what I should be doing to use the
> features of the card properly.
> 
> Can anyone please make a clear guide on what I should do to get my HVR4k
> going properly with Myth? If I can't get things going 'properly' just being
> able to help beta stuff would be good. What SVN do I need to check-out? What
> patches do I need to apply? What Myth do I need to check out? Then what
> patches does that need?
> 
> Please guys, give us some pointers here so we can help with testing and
> maybe help push this forwards. What distro is best for getting things
> working? I'm on Ubuntu 7.10, but would SuSE better serve a solution? Fedora?
> Which?!
