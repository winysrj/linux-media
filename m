Initially rx-mode and tx-mode sounded like more generic properties
that's the reason I ended up in this route. But after this discussion it
looks like its not really generic enough to cater all the use cases.

It make sense for me to perfix "st," for these properties in the st-rc
driver rather than considering them as generic properties.

Thanks for this little guide...
