Ok, just a example. See 
http://www.kaiser-linux.li/index.php/Linux_and_Webcams#Typhoon_Easycam_USB_330K

At the time I bought this cam it had a sn9c102 bridge and PAS202 and was 
working great with gspca. Some time later, somebody reported to me that 
he has the same cam but with a PAC7311. So I just updated my page with 
the new information. AS of coincident, I was working on the PAC7311 at 
the time I got this report!

Anyway, with a good and nice looking page on the LinuxTV wiki, you can 
get more interest from some other people and they may sign up and 
correct the page or ad new information (like this cam has now this chipset).
