The current review process for drivers abandoned by the original author
is not working.

I really, really fail too see the problem with just letting a clean
compile-tested patchset like yours through after, let's say, a week
without any comments at all.  That's probably the only way it is ever
going to be tested by someone with the actual hardware.  Worst case is
that some of the patches will have to be reverted in the next release
(and stable point release).  That's not going to be problematic at all,
given that the patchset only touches a single driver in maintenance
mode.

Please Mauro, can you implement some sort of deadline for your review
cycles?  Half a year is nowhere close to acceptable for non-
controversial stuff like this. 

Spotting the non-controversial patches is easy BTW:  Just look for
those with no comments at all...
