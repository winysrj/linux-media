Thanks for the review,

I've worked through these, and changes that were straightforward have already
been done locally.

Those that were more complicated or will take more thought are now on my todo
list and being worked through...

There are a sprinkling of questions below so I'll send this now :)

I believe they can be optional.
Added an optional section.

Ok - that's Good IMO; Can multiple (more than 2) devices be connected to a
single CSI2 bus?

Even if they can -  I don't think we would support that yet so either way, only
one endpoint!

IMO, port descriptions should be optional - and if not described, then the
driver has no requirement to support that port.

How about:
-----
Ports are optional if they are not connected to anything at the hardware level,
but the driver may not provide any support for ports which are not described.
-----

This would then make supporting the ADV7480 straight forward as it doesn't have
any AFE/TXB.

I can imagine perhaps there are scenarios where someone might use the chip for
the AFE, and not require the HDMI, and thus not connect the HDMI input
connector, or only use the HDMI and not the AFE (of course it could also be said
that those designs would probably consider an alternative/simpler chip)

I consciously placed this up alphabetically sorted with other folders, rather
than sorted with single file drivers.

If that is wrong, and it should be alphabetical across the whole file I can move
it of course.

Looks like we need a script that can automate the sorting, so that a maintainer
can run it just before pushing to Linus or some other less painful point rather
than submitting a patch which will be out of date before it hits the ML.


The script could then also be run as a git hook to sort pre-committing or as
part of an extended checkpatch option too :)

Now I have more documentation yes, I think I can convert some more of these values.

Yes, it is a small possibility.

This locking is a bit of a pain, and I am torn between fine-grained locking, vs
global lock of the whole ADV748x.

The controls already take the global lock - but not all of the pad-format ops or
video-ops.

I'll add more locking.

Thanks - you've cleared that up for me. Comment removed.

I'm sure these are Saturation, there are separate registers for U/V balance as
well, but I don't think they map to V4L2_CID_BLUE_BALANCE/V4L2_CID_RED_BALANCE
either :)

Certainly at the moment we no hardware detect interrupt handling.

Using internal calls to the TX will be the right way I think,

I will have to make sure that the TX pixel rate is defined correctly at link
time, and any time it is updated.

Regmap is on my wish list for this driver already ... I'll try to get that
converted.

Well, I'm missing something. I can't find the bit 0x40 in the documentation here.

CSI-TXA/CSI-TXB maps both have register 0x1e as csi_tx_top_reg_1e with only one
bit documented : "interpret_fs_as_ls" at BIT(7).

I'll try to figure out where this came from or if I'm reading the wrong register
map.

Perhaps it's a magical undocumented bit :)

I also intend to move this TX specific code into the adv748x_csi2 module as well.

As above, and hopefully, I can simplify this to be a single function for the

Talking to myself, - The problem is I never listen. :-)


Do you have any suggestions here?

The AFE can have up to 8 inputs, but only one will be selected.
If the DT describes a single physical connection, (such as on Salvator-X) it is
straightforward that we support only that .. but of course there will be
use-cases with multiple inputs and 'someone' will want to be able to select.

AFAICT there is no way to expose an input selection on a subdev - Is this going
to be a custom control ? :S

In an ideal world - the inputs could be enumerated through the video node inputs
- but of course  - that is a separate driver with no interface between the
subdevs for determining input selection ?

Otherwise - it will have to be an entity for each of the 8 inputs with media
controller setting the routes - but that feels very heavyweight for userspace if
it wants to switch camera inputs :-S

I think it's valuable to keep for people who are bringing up a platform.

Yes, moving those to the init tables seems a good choice.
I think I'll add a reset call to each of the entities as well to move this code
to their respective objects.

Yes, this could be a reasonable thing to do.

Ok

How about MEDIA_ENT_F_IO_V4L for the CSI2 entities.

The distinction between AFE, and HDMI is a bit more difficult:

I could set MEDIA_ENT_F_IO_DTV for HDMI and continue with
MEDIA_ENT_F_ATV_DECODER for analog? Or should this be a VBI variant...

Do these 'functions' have a discernable effect anywhere?

Perhaps - at least worth an error message, but I'm not convinced it should be a
fatal error? The actual connections established will be identifiable through the
media-controller at run time.

I can add an adv_err print and then if someone does try this they'll have a
better understanding of the issue.

I don't know yet - I'll need to discuss this with Niklas further.

I can remove this 'workaround' and leave the code as static immutable links
until they can be supporte.

And free() in remove? Surely that's just the exact same scenario?

Shouldn't we be looking to take a reference to the dev on open, and release on
close instead? (Of course that's a much lower core level issue)

IMO (of course if you disagree, I'll change this) it would be more clear to keep
this as devm_ - and when a core solution is identified, it will be clear to
apply to all the devm's - or the devm's will become automatic?

Maybe it's taking a punt :) (yes)

Also - renaming adv748x_print_info() -> adv748x_identify_chip() :)

Sure - I guess I was following the driver model naming - but yes _init is more
appropriate I think.

I'm less convinced here - they are still doing remove actions - but I can change
them.

Ok - I'll look at this across all the entities.
If the HDMI/AFE call into the CSI2, they can set the control, and keep the
control events, and remove the volatile.

Well ... currently no - because the CSI2 cannot set the control handler mutex to
the global state mutex if it performs the pass through.

However, once I 'simplify' the V4L2_CID_PIXEL_RATE such that AFE and HDMI set
the value in the TX - then the CSI2 control handler can take the state lock.

I'll try to reword this based on what the datasheet is describing here.

There are some specific offsets that have to be applied depending upon the
resolution.

Looks like most other drivers don't bother to check - but I can't actually see
'proof' that it can't happen. It's just 'arg' as passed through the ioctl
handlers... Something must have pulled it across the User/Kernel boundary though ...

I assume this was put in as a check to ensure that the values read are accurate
in some effort to prevent a race against a partially valid state being read.

Yes, I think so - It's not exactly what is being done here - but I think the

Yes, I think regmap may be a useful conversion here.
