Dear all,

First, thanks for your interest in this functionality. I think the  
modifications
are in a shape where they begin to be useful for others. Currently
I'm (still) trying to get some GIT repo where I can host the whole  
stuff.

Thank you all for your support, testing will indeed by important after  
the first
version is "in the wild" :-). I definitely want to keep this going and  
be sure
that I tell you as soon as the code can be accessed.

Kind regards,
Christian.
