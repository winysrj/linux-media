Having an x86 implementation is good.  It would also be good to get
some x86 drivers using CMA asap, so the thing gets some runtime testing
from the masses.  Can we think of anything we can do here?

Regarding the core MM changes: Mel's the man for migration and
compaction.  I wouldn't want to proceed until he (and perferably
Johannes) have spent some quality time with the code.  I'm not seeing
their reviewed-by's of acked-by's and I don't have a good recollection
of their involvement?
