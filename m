The following series implements support for a couple of new protocols
now that we finally reached an agreement on how durations should be
handled in ir-raw-event.

Also included is a one-line fix that got missed in my previous conversion
of drivers/media/dvb/ttpci/budget-ci.c.

(not to mention that this is my first test run with stgit)
