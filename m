Yes, that's what I meant.

The existing enumerations can be extended, by adding new values for unused
values, otherwise API functionality can't be extended. Yet, except
for a gcc bug (or weird optimize option), I fail to see why this would break 
the ABI. 

If this is all about some gcc optimization with newer gcc versions, then maybe
the solution may be to add some pragmas at the code to disable such optimization
when compiling the structs with enum's at videodev2.h.

This doesn't change the existing v4l2_ctrl_type codes. So, it shouldn't be
producing any harm at the existing code.

No, but causing an ABI breakage like what it would happen by replacing
"enums" by u32 would break all binaries on x86_64 kernels (and vice-versa
if using u64, breaking all i386 binaries). 

>From what I remember from the 2006 discussions, even using "unsigned" may 
lead into breakages on some non-x86 architectures that use u16 for enums,
as, on those archs, unsigned is 32 bits.
