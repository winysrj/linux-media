Hi,

I've tried to reach Jean-Francois with this a week ago, but I still
haven't received an answer, so I'm sending it to the mailing list. I'd
appreciate a CC of any follow-ups.

I've been having problems with my ID 0c45:6128 Microdia PC Camera
(SN9C325 + OM6802) using driver gspca_sonixj. Specifically, launching
command:
$ gst-launch-0.10 v4l2src ! ffmpegcolorspace ! pngenc ! filesink \
location=/tmp/file.png
gave a file that is all black. This is problematic because at least
one program (odeskteam) uses a similar method to grab camshots.

I thought it looked like as though the camera hasn't got enough time
to initialize, and indeed, adding an msleep(30) near the end of
sd_start() in sonixj.c solved the problem.
