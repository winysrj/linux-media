Instead of an imprecise V4L2_COLORFX_ARBITRARY, I'm considering adding 
V4L2_COLORFX_CHROMA_BALANCE item and document that it should be used together 
with V4L2_CID_RED_BALANCE and V4L2_CID_BLUE_BALANCE controls. Would something 
like this be acceptable ? I'd like to avoid (many) private controls if possible.
