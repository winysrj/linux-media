Reusing the non-video-secific parts of video-interfaces.txt, how about
the following:

"Common bindings for device graphs"

General concept
---------------

The hierarchical organisation of the device tree is well suited to describe
control flow to devices, but data flow between devices that work together to
form a logical compound device can follow arbitrarily complex graphs.
The device tree graph bindings allow to describe data bus connections between
individual devices, that can't be inferred from device tree parent-child
relationships. The common bindings do not contain any information about the
direction or type of data flow, they just map connections. Specific properties
of the connections can be set depending on the type of connection. To see
how this binding applies to video pipelines, see for example
Documentation/device-tree/bindings/media/video-interfaces.txt.

Data interfaces on devices are described by their child 'port' nodes. The port
node contains an 'endpoint' subnode for each remote device connected to this
port via a bus. If a port is connected to more than one remote device on the
same bus, an 'endpoint' child node must be provided for each of them. If more
than one port is present in a device node or there is more than one endpoint at
a port, or port node needs to be associated with a selected hardware interface,
a common scheme using '#address-cells', '#size-cells' and 'reg' properties is
used.

device {
	...
	#address-cells = <1>;
	#size-cells = <0>;

	port@0 {
		...
		endpoint@0 { ... };
		endpoint@1 { ... };
	};

	port@1 { ... };
};

All 'port' nodes can be grouped under optional 'ports' node, which allows to
specify #address-cells, #size-cells properties independently for the 'port'
and 'endpoint' nodes and any child device nodes a device might have.

device {
	...
	ports {
		#address-cells = <1>;
		#size-cells = <0>;

		port@0 {
			...
			endpoint@0 { ... };
			endpoint@1 { ... };
		};

		port@1 { ... };
	};
};

Each endpoint can contain a 'remote-endpoint' phandle property that points to
the corresponding endpoint in the port of the remote device. Two 'endpoint'
nodes are linked with each other through their 'remote-endpoint' phandles.

device_1 {
	port {
		device_1_output: endpoint {
			remote-endpoint = <&device_2_input>;
		};
	};
};

device_1 {
	port {
		device_2_input: endpoint {
			remote-endpoint = <&device_1_output>;
		};
	};
};


Required properties
-------------------

If there is more than one 'port' or more than one 'endpoint' node or 'reg'
property is present in port and/or endpoint nodes the following properties
are required in a relevant parent node:

 - #address-cells : number of cells required to define port/endpoint
		    identifier, should be 1.
 - #size-cells    : should be zero.

Optional endpoint properties
----------------------------

- remote-endpoint: phandle to an 'endpoint' subnode of a remote device node.
