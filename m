Right.

The V4L2_CID_FLASH_FAULT control should be also supported by the
indicator v4l2-flash sub-device then.

> Could the indicator pattern control be present in the same sub-device?

Yes, this was my intention. To conclude - the indicator v4l2-flash 
sub-device should support up to three controls:
- V4L2_CID_FLASH_TORCH_INTENSITY
- V4L2_CID_FLASH_FAULT
- V4L2_CID_FLASH_INDICATOR_PATTERN (if supported by the LED Flash
				    class driver)

V4L2_CID_FLASH_INDICATOR_PATTERN would be a menu control with
custom menu items.

There is: lm3556. LED subsystem leds-lm355x.c driver supports it.
The driver exposes dedicated sysfs attribute for setting the blinking
pattern (four possible options).
