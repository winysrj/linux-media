As this driver touches on 3 sub-systems (mfd, media and alsa), you need to copy not only media ML, but also mfd and alsa ones, as you'll need that one of the 3 involved maintainers to submit your patches with the ack of the other two ones, for the parts that are under their umbrella.

As the main functionality here is related to media, I suspect that I'll be the one that will be submitting the driver. So, you'll need to c/c the MFD maintainer for the stuff under drivers/mfd/, and the alsa maintainer, for the stuff under sound/[1].

Regards,
Mauro
