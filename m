Well my point is that it can't be. In HMM case inside a single VMA you
can have one page inside GPU memory at address A but next page inside
regular memory at A+4k. So handling this at the VMA level does not make
sense. So in this case you would get the device from the struct page
and you would query through common API to determine if you can do peer
to peer. If not it would trigger migration back to regular memory.
If yes then you still have to solve the IOMMU issue and hence the DMA
API changes that were propose.

In the GPUDirect case the idea is that you have a specific device vma
that you map for peer to peer. Here thing can be at vma level and not at
a page level. Expectation here is that the GPU userspace expose a special
API to allow RDMA to directly happen on GPU object allocated through
GPU specific API (ie it is not regular memory and it is not accessible
by CPU).


Both case are disjoint. Both case need to solve the IOMMU issue which
seems to be best solve at the DMA API level.

Well there is still a large base of hardware that do not have such
feature and some people would like to be able to keep using those.
I believe allowing direct access to GPU object that are otherwise
hidden from regular kernel memory management is still meaningfull.
