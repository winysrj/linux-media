Yes, this makes sense.  I think your solution is indeed cleaner.  If you
want to send it it's fine with me.  I don't really have any preference,
I just wanted to clean a problem that was reported to me. ;)

If you send your changes, my patch can be ignored, otherwise, I can send
a v2 with the changes Jean proposed.
