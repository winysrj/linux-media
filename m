let's see. It still has lots of advantages.

Hacking of hundreds of tuners and advanced gpio and eeprom detection was
coordinated there on requests for research coming up on the lists and it
has several thousand contributors. A wiki was not even in sight then.

I would prefer to see it further maintained for easy searching on hard
facts.

At least don't call it third party.

That is as mad as if you would call the video4linux-list or bytesex.org
third party.

It is/was to that point the official hardware resource and Gunther a
leading tuner/hardware developer and nothing else.

Cheers,
Hermann
