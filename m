What patches? I'm not seeing any such revert patches on my queue.
At least patchwork doesn't show any pending patches from you:
	https://patchwork.linuxtv.org/project/linux-media/list/?submitter=96

Nor from James:
	https://patchwork.linuxtv.org/project/linux-media/list/?submitter=1270

Nor from Antti:
	https://patchwork.linuxtv.org/project/linux-media/list/?submitter=650

Are you sure you submitted any reverse patch? If so, please point
the patches you sent for me to review/apply.

Thanks,
Mauro
