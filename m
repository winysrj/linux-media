That's probably down to economies of scale. Most people who have cable 
will have been supplied with a receiver box by their cable company, so 
buying a PCI/USB card for the computer will be an addtional option for 
most cable users, that the majority don't want/need. Where as for DVB-T 
you pick your own equipment at the shop, so you may well go for 
the PCI/USB adapter as the first option.
