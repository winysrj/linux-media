    <pre wrap="">A question to the maintainer:

what is your plan for getting DVB-S2 support into the mainline kernel?

So many people have put so much time and effort into creating a working
API, drivers
and applications but I have seen no indications of the direction and
timescale anywhere.

All this work is of very little value if it does not end up in the
mainline kernel. Maintaining
out-of-kernel projects and patches over the long term is a terrible waste
of effort for
maintainers, developers and experienced users. It also makes Linux DVB
look less than
professional, and is almost worthless to most end users.

Working code already exists but it needs to be managed into a form that
can be merged
with the kernel.

So how is it going to be done? It's really not that hard.

Bump.

It's disappointingly silent so far....

In the interest of making progress I will be more specific.
 
It is easily possible to use the work that has already been done to quickly create (and debug
and merge) kernel patches which will provide support for one or more DVB-S2 cards.

But before such patches can be created,  there needs to be a clear statement about
which API changes (if any) will be permitted.

How will the API change? Who is going to make the decision? When?

Hopefully,
Hans
