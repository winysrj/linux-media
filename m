How will it give link errors for drivers that require DMA?

Besides, wouldn't it be better to get an error at config time rather
than at link time?  Or even better still, not to be allowed to
configure drivers that depend on DMA if DMA isn't available?

If we add an explicit dependency for HAS_DMA to the Kconfig entries for 
these drivers, then your suggestion would be a good way to allow 
usbcore to be built independently of DMA support.
