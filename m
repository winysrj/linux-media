Curious, does it oops randomly today ?
(i just copied this from omap_iommu_probe, where it always existed).

It is a bit ugly though, and thinking on it again, 16KB is not that
big. We can just use kmalloc here, which does ensure the alignment
(or, better yet, kzalloc, and then ditch the memset).

I disagree; we must check this so user data won't be harmed (hardware
requirement), and if a memory allocation API fails to meet its
requirements - that's really bad and user data is again at stake (much
more will break, not only the iommu driver).

thanks !

No, I can't; it's used when the device is attached to an address space domain.

Yes, that's probably the most (if any) reasonable value to return here
(all other iommu implementations are doing so too).

Thanks,
Ohad.
