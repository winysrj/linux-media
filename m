This design that a fence can only be attached to 1 dmabuf?
Wouldn't it be better to kill the fence_list and just create an array
of pointers to all the fences attached to current dmabuf?
Or some other design that would allow multiple fences to be
attached to a single dmabuf, and a single fence to multiple
dma-bufs without being attached to all and without too many
memory allocations. Maybe we should add a limit in a #define
to how many fences can be attached to a single dmabuf?
More than 4 fences on a single dma-buf is likely overkill, but I don't
want to place a limit yet on how many dma-bufs can attach to a
single fence.

Would mean obsoleting this function, since there's
no longer a single fence.

Make this inline?

Same.

Unconditionally taking same spinlock twice seems a bit overkill,
maybe just drop it in check_signalling if needed?

Some standardized base for hardware dma-buf fence objects would
also be nice, it will make implementing it for drm a lot easier.
