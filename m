The original code is broken, as it doesn't properly honour a max size of 8.
Even if we do some optimization at cx231xx, we still need to fix the tda18271
code, as it is trying to use more than 8 bytes on some writes.

Also, as you noticed, the way cx231xx sends large firmwares to xc5000 is a hack:
it requires to identify that the I2C device is a xc5000 and do an special
treatment for it.

We may actually move all those small_i2c logic to the bridge drivers, adding
those hacks inside the I2C adapter part, but this means that they'll need to 
have some complex-logic that are dependent on what device is connected to it,
damaging the benefits that the I2C bus abstraction brings.

Instead of polluting bridge drivers with I2C-device specific code, the proper
way seems to use parameters to adjust the maximum size, eventually flagging
the broken messages in a way that the I2C adapter won't sent a stop transaction
in the middle of a larger initialization like this one.

Cheers,
Mauro
