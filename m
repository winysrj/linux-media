I get

  scripts/kconfig/conf --oldconfig arch/x86/Kconfig
  drivers/media/Kconfig:146: 'endif' in different file than 'if'
  drivers/media/IR/Kconfig:15: location of the 'if'
  drivers/Kconfig:114: unexpected 'endmenu' within if block
  drivers/Kconfig:1: missing end statement for this entry
  make[1]: *** [oldconfig] Error 1
  make: *** [oldconfig] Error 2

with this. And it seems to be due to a totally broken commit at the
very beginning of the series by a commit called "Kconfig fixes"
(Hah!), that clearly has not been tested at all.

The commit sequence was also done today, apparently immediately before
sending me the pull request. Which sure as hell explains the "clearly
not tested at all" situation.

Don't do this. You are now officially on my shit-list for sending me
total crap.

How effing hard can it be to understand: you don't send me stuff that
hasn't been tested. It needs to be in -next for SEVERAL DAYS, and you
don't rebase it or take it from some random quilt series just before
sending it to me.

That's true _especially_ during the -rc series. But it's damn well
true at any other time too.

I'm angry. I expect at least some _minimal_ amount of competence from
people I pull from. This was not it. Get your ^&#! act together!
