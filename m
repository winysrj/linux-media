Hi Sakari,

IMO, before this patch, we need something like this:

That's still not ok, as it creates a black hole for devnode-based
devices.

I would change it to something like:

	Streaming control
	^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

	Starting and stopping the stream are somewhat complex operations that
	often require to enable streaming on sub-devices which the pipeline 
	consists of. This involves interaction between multiple drivers, sometimes
	more than two. 

	The ``.s_stream()`` op in :c:type:`v4l2_subdev_video_ops` is responsible
	for starting and stopping the stream on the sub-device it is called
	on. 

	Streaming control on devnode-centric devices
	~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

	On **devnode-centric** devices, the main driver is responsible enable
	stream all all sub-devices. On most cases, all the main driver need
	to do is to broadcast s_stream to all connected sub-devices by calling
	:c:func:`v4l2_device_call_all`, e. g.::

		v4l2_device_call_all(&dev->v4l2_dev, 0, video, s_stream, 1);

	Streaming control on mc-centric devices
	~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

	On **mc-centric** devices, it usually requires walking the media graph
	to enable streaming only at the sub-devices which the pipeline consists
	of.

	(place here the details for such scenario)

That sounds too complex, and can lead into troubles, if the same
sub-device driver is used on completely different devices.

IMHO, it should be up to the main driver to navigate at the MC
pipeline and call s_stream(), and not to the sub-drivers.

Thanks,
