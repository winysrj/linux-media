Subject: [PATCH v3 3/5] [RFT] ARM: dts: wheat: Fix ADV7513 address usage
Date: Mon, 12 Feb 2018 22:07:51 +0000

From: Kieran Bingham <kieran.bingham+renesas@ideasonboard.com>

The r8a7792 Wheat board has two ADV7513 devices sharing a single i2c
bus, however in low power mode the ADV7513 will reset it's slave maps to
use the hardware defined default addresses.

The ADV7511 driver was adapted to allow the two devices to be registered
correctly - but it did not take into account the fault whereby the
devices reset the addresses.

This results in an address conflict between the device using the default
addresses, and the other device if it is in low-power-mode.

Repair this issue by moving both devices away from the default address
definitions.

v2:
 - Addition to series

v3:
 - Split map register addresses into individual declarations.
