I am looking to get another card to replace a fusionhdtv7 that died. 
After spending more then a year trying to get a problem pined down, it 
turns out the card was deffective. I tried contacting the company, There 
seems to be no mention of warranty period on the box, in the manual or 
on the web site. It may be there, But I didn't find it. The company 
hasn't responded. Hauppauge cards have proven to be good and well 
supported by linux and now I see the 2250 has driver support and may 
even get support for the analog side. People in the AVS forum seem to 
think the tuner used in the fusion are among the best, better then the 
LG 6th gen. What I'd like to know is how these two cards stand up to 
each other, both for their tuners and overall. It will be used in a 
computer along side a HVR-1800, and a nexus-s, though I would like to 
replace the nexus with a dual s/s2 at some point or add one since new 
cards are PCIe and the nexus is PCI. I have a limited number of free 
PCIe slots, so I am only looking at multi tuner cards.
