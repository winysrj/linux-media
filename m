Mauro,

please give some further comments, how to proceed within this
"patchwork" stuff.

For what I can see, you get some of out of sync patches so far.

Do you do the sync and can I ignore such remaining efforts, or do you
prefer people are waiting until this is somehow properly lined up again?

I have nothing important and nobody cared about the oops on the Compro
T750F stuff, on which I was not involved, but I would like to have a
warning in for the Asus 3in1 not to use a rotor with it.

Cheers,
Hermann
