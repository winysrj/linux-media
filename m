Why not merge the driver as-is? The community would get support for
several cards, easy access to the code without the need for separate git
repositories or dkms packages, and a maintainer that understands the
hardware and driver code.

The whole purpose of driver development is bringing support for existing
hardware to available user applications, preferably with existing APIs.
And exactly that is in this pull request.
In the whole discussion I cannot find a single reason, how merging this
driver would violate the linux development principles.

I think my repository represents the main development branch, just
maintained by different people (adding Manu, Andreas, Oliver, in case
they want to object). The CrazyCat repo is not a fork (including
history), it is just a snapshot of the driver plus several patches.

I already promised to help with adding TBS support.
