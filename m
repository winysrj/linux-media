We tested such approach and finally with 3.0-rc1 it works fine. You can find
an example for dma_declare_coherent() together with required memblock_remove()
calls in the following patch series:

All these issues with ioremap has been finally resolved in 3.0-rc1. Like
Russell pointed me in http://www.spinics.net/lists/arm-kernel/msg127644.html,
ioremap can be fixed to work on early reserved memory areas by selecting
ARCH_HAS_HOLES_MEMORYMODEL Kconfig option.

This is another story. DMA-mapping framework definitely needs some 
extensions to allow more detailed specification of the allocated memory
(currently we have only coherent and nearly ARM-specific writecombine).
During Linaro Memory Management summit we agreed that the 
dma_alloc_attrs() function might be needed to clean-up the API and
provide a nice way of adding new memory parameters. Having a possibility
to allocate contiguous cached buffers might be one of the new DMA
attributes. Here are some details of my proposal:

That was probably the biggest mistake at the beginning. We definitely 
should have learned dma-mapping framework and its internals.

I hope that once the dma_alloc_attrs() API will be accepted, I will add
support for memory attributes to videobuf2-dma-contig allocator.

I'm open to discussion.
