Ugh. Looks like we actually have a similar problem with multiple lpc super
i/o based CIR drivers. I'd probably move both the irq and io region
requests in ite-cir, fintek-cir, nuvoton-cir, ene_ir and winbond-cir. If
I'm thinking clearly, I've actually seen a very similar report for one of
the other CIR drivers recently. Good catch. But yeah, lets do the same for
all the drivers, and move request_region as well.
