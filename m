Hi Hartmut,
I got the same tuning problems as Patrick. After your patch the Pinnacle =

400e is not working anymore. I can get a signal, but no lock at all.
I took a look at the PCB and there is definitely an LNBP21PD soldered =

onto it.
Your patch disables the modulation of the 22kHz signal inside the demod =

as fas as I understood, but then the LNBP21PD was supposed to generate it.

Unfortunately this is not possible with the Pinnacle 400e. I took a look =

at the LNBP21PD datasheet which states, that DSQIN is supposed to be =

connected to GND if you don't want the 22kHz signal to be generated by =

the LNBP21 itself. Guess what?! Pin 14(DSQIN) is connected to GND.

For the time being I reverted your patch on my local system and the =

Pinnacle 400e is working flawlessly again.

  Andr=E9
