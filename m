Greetings:

The pcHDTV HD5500 ships with an IR receiver but no remote. Support
seems to be there:

input: cx88 IR (pcHDTV HD5500 HDTV) as /devices/pci0000:00/0000:00:06.0/0000:01:07.1/input/input6

Does anyone know of a remote that actually works with it? I have read
that it is supposed to be a "Phillips/Magnavox" type, so I tried
setting several programmable remotes to the codes for Phillips and
Magnavox TVs, but nothing has worked so far.

Thanks,
-- Mark
