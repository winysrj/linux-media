Devin,

I perfectly remember your opinion regarding vtuner.

Still the same nonsense - why I should add 10x or even 100 times more
code to achieve not the same but may be 80-90% same result?

The idea is hell simple = allow to use those remote tuners by
100% of dvb api compliant applications. Not 80%, but 100%.
