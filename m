I think that I already NACK'ed the patch.

1) drivers/media/videobuf-dma-contig.c should not use
dma_alloc_coherent. We shouldn't support the proposed API.

2) I don't think that the DMA API (drivers/base/dma-mapping.c) is not
for creating "cache". Generally, the kernel uses "pool" concept for
something like that.

IMHO, reverting the commit 309caa9cc6ff39d261264ec4ff10e29489afc8f8
temporary (or temporary disabling it for systems that had worked) is
the most reasonable approach. I don't think that breaking systems that
had worked is a good idea even if the patch does the right thing. I
believe that we need to fix the broken solution
(videobuf-dma-contig.c) before the commit.
