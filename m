This type of fence can be used with hardware synchronization for simple
hardware that can block execution until the condition
(dma_buf[offset] - value) >= 0 has been met when WAIT_GEQUAL is used,
or (dma_buf[offset] != 0) has been met when WAIT_NONZERO is set.

A software fallback still has to be provided in case the fence is used
with a device that doesn't support this mechanism. It is useful to expose
this for graphics cards that have an op to support this.

Some cards like i915 can export those, but don't have an option to wait,
so they need the software fallback.

I extended the original patch by Rob Clark.

v1: Original
v2: Renamed from bikeshed to seqno, moved into dma-fence.c since
    not much was left of the file. Lots of documentation added.
v3: Use fence_ops instead of custom callbacks. Moved to own file
    to avoid circular dependency between dma-buf.h and fence.h
v4: Add spinlock pointer to seqno_fence_init
v5: Add condition member to allow wait for != 0.
    Fix small style errors pointed out by checkpatch.
v6: Move to a separate file. Fix up api changes in fences.
