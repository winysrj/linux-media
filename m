Yea, I've noticed this and this basically what we expect from iommu driver. 
However the iommu.h API requires a separate call to map each single memory page.
This is quite ineffective approach and imho the API need to be extended to allow
mapping of the arbitrary set of pages.

Thanks for your comments! We will check how is it suitable for our case.
