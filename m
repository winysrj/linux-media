Okay.

The revert to platform_data needs to happen ASAP though.  If this
second step isn't ready really quickly, then the current patches
should be reverted to give some breathing room for creating the
replacement patches.  However, it's not such a rush if the below
patch really does eliminate all of the nastiness of the original
series. (I haven't looked and a rolled up diff of the first series and
this change, so I don't know for sure).

In principle I agree with this patch.  Some comments below.

'sizeof(*cell) is a teensy bit safer.  Also, this can be more concise:

static int mfd_platform_add_cell(struct platform_device *pdev,
				 const struct mfd_cell *cell)
{
	if (!cell)
		return 0;

	pdev->mfd_cell = kmemdup(cell, sizeof(*cell), GFP_KERNEL);
	return pdev->mfd_cell ? 0 : -ENOMEM;
}

Looks like kfreeing the cell should become part of the
platform_device_release() function.  Which would remove it from here,
and also ...

Blech!  Yeah, this should become consistent that platform data
*always* comes from pdev->dev.platform_data.

Move this down to by the of_node pointer.  May as well collect all the
supplemental data about the device in the same place.
