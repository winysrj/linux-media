True. Analog gain does still belong there.

We might need more than one new class.

At least the et8ek8 prefers the same. There may be some parameters that
might be needed for the algorithm which might need to be a little more
complex than that.

Uh, well, at least the granularity of the gain steps can be different in
different gain stages.
