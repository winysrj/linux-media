I have mind few uses cases:
- the basic one when an HW device need contiguous memory.
- I have a device that could not cross some memory boundaries so I
need a specific allocator for it.
- when allocating memory for security some platform have address
constraints or need to allocate memory in specific areas (most of the
time because of firewall limited capacities in terms of regions)
