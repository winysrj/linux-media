As you will soon realize, the patch preparation is equally important as the
patch content itself. Often, it takes the same time to implement or
fix something, as it takes to prepare the patchset carefully.

When deciding how to prepare your patches you have to keep two main things in mind:

  * The kernel build can never be broken, in any configuration and in any
    point of the kernel history (in other words, by any patch of a patchset).
    This is called 'keep the bisectability' because it's essential
    to make 'git bisect' work properly.

  * Do as much as possible to facilitate reviews from other people.
    This is also important because patches tend to be accepted quicker
    if they recieve attention (reviews, testing, etc.).

In this particular case, I think that the easier way to review is to be
able to see the complete driver in a single patch. Of course, I can be
wrong, so feel free to correct me.

Please note that the reviews I made where almost nitpicks, and the
driver looks good in general. I cannot provide any testing for lack of hardware.

Also, for your next patch, add the output of v4l2-compliance tool,
showing it passes all the tests. This shows your driver is in good shape.
Get v4l2-compliancefrom the git repo, as distribution often provide
an outdated version.

(And another thing, please fix your mail client: the reply-to is pointing
to '20130315120856.GA2989@localhost.arpanet.local'.)

Thanks for your work and best regards,
