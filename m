Just for clarity: this patch does wait for the trailing silence. It does
NOT wait for the trailing silence to have (at least) a specific length.
(The pulse event is only fired after the pulse has ended, because the
length of the pulse needs to be known)

I don't think the current code is able to decode NEC48. Is NEC48
recognizable in some other way than just being longer?

In that case, the alternative would be to start a timer when the
TRAILING_SPACE is entered, and trigger the key-event after, say 2 bit-times.

I use the IR receiver built in to the TBS6281 DVB-T tuner card. I also
have a TBS6982 DVB-S card, but I guess it's the same hardware.

It also depends on what "reasonable" means. I've found 300+ms, which is
unusable long.
