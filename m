We have 2 problems:
 - omap24xxcam compilation broken
 - circular dependency between sched.h and wait.h

To fix the broken compilation we can do what the rest of the kernel is
doing, which is to include sched.h.
Then, the circular dependency is fixed by some different approach
which would probably change *all* current usage of TASK_*.

IMO, there's no need to create a dependency between those issues.
