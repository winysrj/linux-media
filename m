Yes, that should be easy to do.

OTOH I think they improve readability.
Anyway, this will become obsolete with the next step you're suggesting:

Yeah, it would be nice if we could do that, but I'm not sure if it's
entirely possible.
Mute + automute and the selected input seem to be coupled via gpio
settings. See the first third
of function audio_mux().
I will have to take a deeper look into the code to see if splitting the
function really makes sense...

I've put it on my TODO list, but I'm not sure if I'll find some time for
it this weekend.
