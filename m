I didn't see a consensus on whether dma_buf should enforce some form
of serialization within the API - so atleast for v1 of dma-buf, I
propose to 'not' impose a restriction, and we can tackle it (add new
ops or enforce as design?) whenever we see the first need of it - will
that be ok? [I am bending towards the thought that it is a problem to
solve at a bigger platform than dma_buf.]
