Hi All,

Can someone please give me a quick jumper start -
Where and which one is the v4l development branch?
How can I get the branch? Howto submit patches?
The WIKIs seems dead, besides the interface spec, is there any other howto
document?

I am not on this mailing list yet - please include my email address for the
reply.

Many thanks for your help in advance,
Monkey
