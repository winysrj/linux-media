not sure about staging, but could make sense to mark as experimental.

Looks like Dave is making some progress on drm usage of buffer sharing
between gpu's.. if that is ready to go in at the same time, it might
be a bit logistically simpler for him to put dmabuf in the same pull

collectively simpler ;-)
