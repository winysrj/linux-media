Thanks a lot for this excellent overview. I think at least for the first
version of dmabuf we should drop the sync_* interfaces and simply require
users to bracket their usage of the buffer from the attached device by
map/unmap. A dma_buf provider is always free to cache the mapping and
simply call sync_sg_for of the streaming dma api.

If it later turns out that we want to be able to cache the sg list also on
the use-site in the driver (e.g. map it into some hw sg list) we can
always add that functionality later. I just fear that sync ops among N
devices is a bit ill-defined and we already have a plethora of ill-defined
issues at hand. Also the proposed api doesn't quite fit into what's
already there, I think an s/device/dma_buf_attachment/ would be more
consistent - otherwise the dmabuf provider might need to walk the list of
attachements to get at the right one for the device.

Either I've always missed it or no one ever described it that consisely,
but now I see the use-case for mmap: Simpler drivers (i.e. not gpus) might
need to expose a userspace mapping and only the provider knows how to do
that in a coherent fashion. I want this in the docs (if it's not there yet
...).

But even with that use-case in mind I still have some gripes with the
current mmap interfaces as proposed:
- This use-case explains why the dmabuf provider needs to expose an mmap
  function. It doesn't explain why we need to expose that to userspace
  (instead of faking whatever mmap the importing driver already exposes).
  Imo the userspace-facing part of dmabuf should be about buffer sharing
  and not about how to access that buffer, so I'm still missing the reason
  for that.
- We need some way to tell the provider to sync all completed dma
  operations for userspace mmap access. sync_for_cpu would serve that use.
  But given that we strive for zero-copy I think the kernel shouldn't
  ever need to access the contents of a dmabuf and it would therefore make
  more sense to call it sync_for_mmap.
- And the ugly one: Assuming you want this to be coherent for (almost)
  unchanged users of exisiting subsystem and want this to integrate
  seamlessly with gpu driver management, we also need a
  finish_mmap_access. We _can_ fake this by shooting down userspace ptes
  (if the provider knows about all of them, and it should thanks to the
  mmap interface) and we do that trick on i915 (for certain cases). But
  this is generally slow and painful and does not integrate well with
  other gpu memory management paradigms, where userspace is required to
  explicit bracket access.

Yours, Daniel
