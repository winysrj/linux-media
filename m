No. They are created just like any other platform devices are created.

No differences here. Both PHY and controller will have dt information or hwmod
data using which platform devices will be created.

right. It's embedded in the platform data of the controller.

Currently the driver assigns static labels (corresponding to the label used in
the platform data of the controller).

right.

right.

hmm.. it's not going to be simple though as the platform device for the PHY and
controller can be created in entirely different places. e.g., in some cases the
PHY device is a child of some mfd core device (the device will be created in
drivers/mfd) and the controller driver (usually) is created in board file. I
guess then we have to come up with something to share a pointer in two
different files.

phy_create is the API by which the PHY's driver (the supplier) hook into the
PHY framework. It's like the controller driver will always interact with the
PHY driver through the PHY framework.
