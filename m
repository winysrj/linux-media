It depends on what device do you have. Several I2C chips have the repeat
logic inside the I2C microcontroller PROM firmware. or at the remote
controller itself. So, there's nothing we can do to change it.

I have even one device here (I think it is a saa7134-based Kworld device) 
that doesn't send any repeat event at all for most keys (I think it only
sends repeat events for volume - Can't remember the specific details anymore -
too many devices!).

The devices that produce repeat events can be adjusted via the normal
input layer tools like kbdrate.

Thanks,
Mauro
