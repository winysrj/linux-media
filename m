Greetings From Mr. Soumaila Sorgho

	I have a Mutual/Beneficial Business Project that would be beneficial
to you. I only have two questions to ask of you, if you are
interested.

1. Can you handle this project?
2. Can I give you this trust?

Please note that the deal requires high level of maturity, honesty and
secrecy. This will involve moving some money from my office, on trust
to your hands or bank account. Also note that i will do everything to
make sure that the money is moved as a purely legitimate fund, so you
will not be exposed to any risk.

I request for your full co-operation. I will give you details and
procedure when I receive your reply, to commence this transaction, I
require you to immediately indicate your interest by a return reply. I
will be waiting for your response in a timely manner.

Contact  Email: soumailasorgho@yandex.com
Best Regard,
Mr. Soumaila Sorgho
