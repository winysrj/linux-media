I don't think it's necessary to add a new flag. It should be sufficient
to add a property like "DTV_SUPPORTED_DELIVERY_SYSTEMS", which should be
read-only and return an array of type fe_delivery_system_t.

Querying this new property on present kernels hopefully fails with a
non-zero return code. in which case FE_GET_INFO should be used to query
the delivery system.

In future kernels we can provide a default implementation, returning
exactly one fe_delivery_system_t for unported drivers. Other drivers
should be able to override this default implementation in their
get_property callback.

Regards,
Andreas
