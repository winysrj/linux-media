Is Mike really the maintainer of the cx25840 module and not only of the 
pvrusb2 one? If he's not the maintainer you should contact the real one, 
cause I don't think that Mike can help much regarding patches for the 
cx25840 in that case.

Also I might need to adjust the patch cause of the recent changes that 
happened there the last few months. (I don't know when I'll find time 
for this...)

Regards,
Sven
