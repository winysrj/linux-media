Ok, I wish this had been getting more testing in Linux-next or
something, but I suspect that what I'll do is to commit this patch
asap, and then commit another patch that turns off udev firmware
loading entirely for the synchronous firmware loading case.

Why? Just to get more testing, and seeing if there are reports of
breakage. Maybe some udev out there has a different search path (or
because udev runs in a different filesystem namespace or whatever), in
which case running udev as a fallback would otherwise hide the fact
that he direct kernel firmware loading isn't working.

We can (and will) revert things if that turns out to break things, but
I'd like to make any failures of the firmware direct-load path be fast
and hard, so that we can see when/what it breaks.

Ok? Comments?
