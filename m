We are using __iommu_* implemented in "arch/arm64/mm/dma-mapping.c" in
review patch
http://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/iommu/2015-July/013898.html
Without patch "[media] vb2: use dma_map_sg_attrs to prevent unnecessary
sync", vb2 will sync data to device twice.
One is from "dma_map_sg" in "vb2_dc_get_userptr", the other is from
"dma_sync_sg_for_device" in "vb2_dc_prepare". dma_map_sg use orig_nents,
and dma_sync_sg_for_device use nents."

We do not run in 32bits mode, but check "arm_dma_sync_sg_for_device" in
"arch/arm/mm/dma-mapping.c", 
ops->sync_single_for_device(dev, sg_dma_address(s), s->length, dir);
It looks like has same issue.

I found that in __iommu_sync_sg_for_device, it use sg->length , do not
cover full buffer.
By adding log in " __iommu_sync_sg_for_device" without patch "[media]
vb2: use dma_map_sg_attrs to prevent unnecessary sync", we could see
total synced size are different between called from dma_map_sg and
dma_sync_sg_for_device.
__iommu_sync_sg_for_device called from dma_sync_sg_for_device got
updated SG entries number but it use un-updated sg length.
After using "DMA_ATTR_SKIP_CPU_SYNC" to skip sync in vb2_dc_get_userptr,
we got some part of the buffer not sync.

This patch goes on top of these two patchs

Yes, if this patch correct, same thing should be done for
videobuf2-dma-sg.c
