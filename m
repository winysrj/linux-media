v4l2_device_put() got introduced in commit 
bedf8bcf6b4f90a6e31add3721a2e71877289381 ("v4l2-device: add kref and a release 
function"). If I understand its purpose correctly, drivers that use a 
v4l2_device instance should use the v4l2_device release callback to release 
device structures instead of counting video_device release callbacks manually. 
In that case I think the v4l2-dev.c code is correct, and all drivers that use 
v4l2_device should be fixed.

The above patch fixes the problem in a central location, but seems to defeat 
the original purpose of v4l2_device_get/put().

Hans, could you please comment on that ?
