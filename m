What I've found with *my* etnaviv drm implementation (not Christian's - I
found it impossible to work with Christian, especially with the endless
"msm doesn't do it that way, so we shouldn't" responses and his attitude
towards cherry-picking my development work [*]) is that it's much easier to
keep the GPU MMU local to the GPU and under the control of the DRM MM code,
rather than attaching the IOMMU to the DMA API and handling it that way.

There are several reasons for that:

1. DRM has a better idea about when the memory needs to be mapped to the
   GPU, and it can more effectively manage the GPU MMU.

2. The GPU MMU may have TLBs which can only be flushed via a command in
   the GPU command stream, so it's fundamentally necessary for the MMU to
   be managed by the GPU driver so that it knows when (and how) to insert
   the flushes.


* - as a direct result of that, I've stopped all further development of
etnaviv drm, and I'm intending to strip it out from my Xorg DDX driver
as the etnaviv drm API which Christian wants is completely incompatible
with the non-etnaviv drm, and that just creates far too much pain in the
DDX driver.
