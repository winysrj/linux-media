I would recommend using v4l2-ctl --all --list-inputs, this enumerates
inputs as well (which includes reading the tuner status). This would
have failed with all these tests with this patch series.

I remain skeptical about this. I'm simply not sure what, if anything,
might break after this change. You need to test with applications that
can switch between V4L and DVB and that can handle an alsa device for
audio capture. MythTV is probably one. None of the applications you
are testing can switch between V4L and DVB devices dynamically to my
knowledge.

Today it is no problem for an application to open the alsa device,
start streaming analog video + audio, stop streaming video + audio,
switch to a digital input and start streaming the transport stream
from the dvb input.

This is all valid. But after this change you will no longer be able
to switch back and forth because the alsa open() locks the tuner mode.

I'm afraid that we will break some applications, either open source or
not, by making this change.

By locking the tuner mode only while streaming audio apps would be prevented
from breaking. The only time the trigger function will return an error
is when some other application has the tuner in a different (e.g. DVB)
mode and starting to stream would forcefully switch the tuner to
a different mode. And we *know* that will cause all sorts of unpredictable
behavior which is why we are doing all this effort to prevent that from
happening. Returning an error in that case makes perfect sense to me and
it is something that should not happen during normal use.

The remainder of the list looks OK to me.

I would also recommend making more use of the various command line tools:
arecord, v4l2-ctl, dvbv5-zap. By combining these you can test scenarios
that are hard to test in applications such as this:

	- make a small utility that just opens the alsa node without streaming
	  and that keeps it open (i.e. sleep(100000) or something). Let's call it alsaopen.
	- run alsaopen.
	- call arecord to start streaming audio (most likely using
	  the analog TV tuner).
	- stream with v4l2-ctl to see if that works (it should)
	- stop v4l2-ctl
	- now use dvbv5-zap to select a DVB channel: I would expect that that
	  fails because you are still streaming audio.
	- stop arecord.
	- try dvbv5-zap again: I think this should work, even though the alsaopen
	  utility still has alsa open, but with the current proposal this will fail.
	- stop alsaopen.
	- now dvbv5-zap should work.

Regards,

	Hans
