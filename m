Ok, thanks for the clarification.

The model I proposed in my review to patch 1/4 (split remote physical
address from local address pool) allows to avoid this workaround.

Oh, interesting, I hadn't noticed that you gave this talk -- at the same
conference as Vladimir's talk! No video recording apparently, but are
slides available at least?

I've been mixing hotplug and DT overlays and that generated confusion,
sorry. My point exists even with no hotplug, see the reply to patch 1/4.
