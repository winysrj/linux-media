Paul,

give Mike some time for it.

There are much more variables in question, that can be different on
devices now seen in the wild for the first time and a proper framework
must be employed.

If you can't wait, ask Mike do send you the files, seems they are recent
enough for current v4l-dvb, but better is to wait and start with some
unified testing base.

Cheers,
Hermann
