Subject: What digital/analogue video capture card do you use?

Hi Guys,

I have test a number of internal and external analogue video capture cards
with Kubuntu 12.04 with more or less success.

But I have failed find any cost effective digital ones.

Could someone point me at a card which is:

- cost-effective 
- internal (PCIe)
- uses hardware compression (low latency)
- digital and analogue (maybe DVI-D)

What card do you use?

Thanks for your help.

Steve
