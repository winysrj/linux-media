Hi. I'm from Poland. Sorry for my english.
I can't install drivers via git on my openSUSE 12.1
My kernel is 3.1.0-1.2.
Message from ./build script:

eo@linux-7udx:~/media_build> ./build
Checking if the needed tools for openSUSE 12.1 (i586) are available
ERROR: please install "Proc::ProcessTable", otherwise, build won't work.
I don't know distro openSUSE 12.1 (i586). So, I can't provide you a hint 
with the package names.
Be welcome to contribute with a patch for media-build, by submitting a 
distro-specific hint
to linux-media@vger.kernel.org
Build can't procceed as 1 dependency is missing at ./build line 223.

"Proc::ProcessTable" is already installed 
(perl-Proc-ProcessTable-0.44-2.1.i586.rpm).
Please help me.
