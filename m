The default decoder should be the one set by the rc keymap.

Yes, you want to be able to multiple remotes on the IR device (which
you can do as long as the scancodes don't overlap, I think), and the 
lirc device is implemented as a decoder, so you might want to see the
raw IR as well as have it decoded.

At the moment, no. David Hardeman has sent a patch for this:
