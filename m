the Bluetooth specification defines that the Maximum Encryption Key Size shall be in the range 7 to 16 octets. Which is also reflected in these defines:

#define SMP_MIN_ENC_KEY_SIZE            7
#define SMP_MAX_ENC_KEY_SIZE            16

So it is buf[4] since we know it never gets larger than 16. So even in this case the warning is bogus.

I have no problem in increasing it to buf[5] to shut up the compiler, but that is what I would be doing here. I am not fixing an actual bug.

I had to use the -Wno-format-trunction in a few projects since gcc was completely lost. And since we were using snprintf, I saw no point in trying to please gcc with a larger buffer.
