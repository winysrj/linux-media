These are static functions, and as such kerneldoc doesn't enforce
kernel-doc style comments, so in the dma-buf files, we've not followed
them for static functions.
That said, it is certainly a valuable advice, and I could create a
separate patch-set for updating the documentation for the static
functions as well.

So, short answer is, it is left to the exporter to decide. The dma-buf
framework should not even attempt to decide or enforce any of the
above.

At each dma_buf_attach(), there's a callback to the exporter, where
the exporter can decide, if it intends to handle these kind of cases,
on the best way forward.

The exporter might, for example, decide to migrate backing storage,
should there be a need to do so, or simply deny when the new
attachment has more restrictive DMA constraints, as you mentioned as a
possibility.

These changes simply allow the exporter, should it wish to, to take
the DMA constraints into consideration while making those decisions.
For the current cases, it should not even matter if the DMA
constraints aren't shared by the devices.

I tried to think of the scenarios I could think of, but If you still
feel this approach doesn't help with your concerns, I'll graciously
accept advice to improve it.

Once again, thanks for reviewing these changes!
