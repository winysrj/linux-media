Small consolation, but we do warn that filesystem-dax is still
considered experimental when mounting a filesystem with "-o dax"

Ok, that's completely safe since filesystem-dax mappings are not
involved in a vmalloc backed virtual address range.

Yes, unless / until we can switch userspace to using a new memory
registration api that includes a way for the kernel to revoke access
to a dax mapping. Another mitigation is following through on support
for moving dax support from a global mount flag to a per-inode flag to
at least prevent dax from leaking to use cases that need explicit
coordination.

Ok, I'll take a look.
