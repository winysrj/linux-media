Thank you for testing this.
Of course the Bayer to RGB conversion can have a impact on the test result.

To avoid this, it might be better to first try out the test pattern 
generated by the color or monochrom mtv9v022 sensor. With the test 
pattern no Bayer conversion should be made.

Our setup in the i.MX31 controller:
* Reg 0x53FC_0060 (CSI_SENS_CONF), Bit 3 (SENS_PIX_CLK_POL)  = 0 
 <quote> pixel clock is directly applied to internal circuitry 
 (rising edge). </quote>
  
 Which means its using rising edge (See Datasheet mcimx31 Rev3.4 10/2007 i.MX31):
 <quote> The timing specifications are referenced to the rising 
 edge of SENS_PIX_CLK when the SENS_PIX_CLK_POL bit in the 
 CSI_SENS_CONF register is cleared. When the SENS_PIX_CLK_POL 
 is set, the clock is inverted and all timing specifications 
 will remain the same but are referenced to the falling edge of 
 the clock.</quote>

* The MCLOCK is setup with 20MHz

Setup of the camera sensor mt9v022:
* Reg 0x74 Bit 4 = 0	# Pixelclock at rising edge
* Reg 0x7F= 0x2800      # generates vertical shade
* Reg 0x70 Bit 5 = 0    # disable noise correction
			(is nessessary for correct testpattern)

Our result: test pattern verical is ok

Now changed setup to:
* Reg 0x74 Bit 4 = 1	# Pixelclock at falling edge

Our result: test pattern has errors on a closer look.

We have tested this with PCM037/PCM970 on a 2.6.39-rc6.
