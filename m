Hi, Antti,

Thanks for taking the time to answer my request. However, I am afraid  
I am not able to find the vendor drivers you mention - if I had I  
would not have posted about it. No matter how much time I spend  
scouring the Compro website I can only find Windows drivers - nothing  
about linux.... If you know where they are located could you please  
mail me a link?

BR

Erik.
