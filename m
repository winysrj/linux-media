See drivers/media/Kconfig :

config MEDIA_SUBDRV_AUTOSELECT
	bool "Autoselect ancillary drivers (tuners, sensors, i2c, frontends)"
	depends on MEDIA_ANALOG_TV_SUPPORT || MEDIA_DIGITAL_TV_SUPPORT || 
MEDIA_CAMERA_SUPPORT || MEDIA_SDR_SUPPORT
	depends on HAS_IOMEM
	select I2C
	select I2C_MUX
	select SPI
	default y
	help
	  By default, a media driver auto-selects all possible ancillary
	  devices such as tuners, sensors, video encoders/decoders and
	  frontends, that are used by any of the supported devices.

	  This is generally the right thing to do, except when there
	  are strict constraints with regards to the kernel size,
	  like on embedded systems.

	  Use this option with care, as deselecting ancillary drivers which
	  are, in fact, necessary will result in the lack of the needed
	  functionality for your device (it may not tune or may not have
	  the needed demodulators).

	  If unsure say Y.

Antti
