Initially the expectation was that userspace would not pass a buffer
to multiple subsystems for writing (or that if it did, it would get
the undefined results that one could expect)..  so dealing w/
synchronization was punted.

I expect, though, that one of the next steps is some sort of
sync-object mechanism to supplement dmabuf
