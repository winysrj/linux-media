    I wish I went the programming path, instead of electronics...  I 
would love to help, I can trace tracks and probe most circuits (BGA are 
a pain) I could help with PCB interconects if needed (GPIO connection 
config's) but I guess most of the designs would just be re-hash's of the 
Demo board that NXP sell ;o(

    I don't have the "Hauppauge" brand unit, but I have a unit from 
DigitalNOW Dual Hybrid, If I could be of any assistance ;o)
