What the others should have done previously?

They could only wait.

What should Mauro have done better?

Say, after Manu's pull request suddenly appeared, thanks, I merge it now
over night and forget about all efforts others did.

You are the most trusted guy on linux-dvb for me.

Markus should have accept your help instead giving Mauro an ultimatum to
merge his stuff within the next 24 hours and we would have one problem
less.

Put at least a sticker on such guys like Uwe/Derek and Manu should do it
as well.

I'm open for everything fair to find a solution.

Hermann
