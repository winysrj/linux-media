I would actually like to see a cma_size kernel option of some sort. This would
be for the global CMA pool only as I don't think we should try to do anything
more complicated here.

While it is relatively easy for embedded systems to do a recompile every time
you need to change the pool size, this isn't an option on 'normal' desktop
systems.

While usually you have more than enough memory on such systems and don't need
CMA, there are a number of cases where you do want to reserve sufficient
memory. Usually these involve lots of video capture cards in one system.

What I was wondering about is how this patch series changes the allocation
in case it can't allocate from the CMA pool. Will it attempt to fall back
to a 'normal' allocation?

The reason I ask is that for desktop systems you could just start with a CMA
pool of size 0. And only in specific situations would you need to add a
cma_size kernel parameter depending on your needs. But this scheme would
require a fallback scenario in case of a global CMA pool of size 0.

Hmm, perhaps this fallback scenario is more driver specific. For SoC platform
video devices you may not want a fallback, whereas for PCI(e)/USB devices you
do. I don't know what's best, frankly.
