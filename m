I get back to working on this specific part, but I don't know how
these analog inputs should be modeled.
On page 68 of ADV7604_HW_RevF there is Figure 11 showing typical
configurations using AIN_SEL[2:0].
I can see 4 inputs muxed : this would suggest to have 4 pads for analog inputs.
Not sure it makes sense though...

Thanks,
JM
