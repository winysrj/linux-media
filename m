I do not know.  I normally don't let cx18-alsa.ko load, due to
PulseAudio's persistence at keeping the device nodes open (which makes
unloading the cx18.ko module for development a hassle.)

I can add some information about what is going on in userspace.  This
was on a Fedora 10 machine.  When devices nodes show up, the HAL daemon
and PulseAudio start using the device nodes right away.

That activity  triggers cx18.ko to do a firmware load which gets udevd
running to satisfy firmware requests, and then the cx18 driver issues
some simple commands to the CX23418 firmware, which will have
acknowledgment interrupts coming back from the CX23418.  I resolved the
firmware race in cx18*.ko a while ago, so I'm confident its not an
issue.

The BUG looks like some sort of mmap() race or memory management problem
outside of the cx18*.ko modules, given that mmput(), which appears to be
an mm specific reference counting function, is involved.

It could also be in ALSA I guess.

I'm not sure how in the cx18-alsa.ko things can be screwed up so badly
that it messes up the kernel's reference counting of mm structures.

I'll take a harder look at it myself this weekend, but the kernel mm
system is a little out of my current realm of experience.  Looks like I
get to learn, because I'm not going to bisect a BUG() that halts the
machine and risks disk corruption every time.

Andy
