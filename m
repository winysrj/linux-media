I think we'll likely need changes for ALSA, but I don't think we know which 
ones yet. For that reason I'd avoid creating any ALSA-specific API for now 
until we implement proper support for ALSA devices. I'm fine, however, with 
deprecating the ALSA API we have now, before it gets (ab)used.

This is something Hans and I have discussed at the FOSDEM, and ended up 
disagreeing.

I like the single struct dev here, but I believe it should be moved before the 
union, or, as Hans proposed, that the reserved bytes should be moved after the 
union. However, the reason why I like your proposal has probably nothing to do 
with your intents.

To start directly with the big news, I believe the MC device node entity types 
are bogus. They should never have been created in the first place, and your 
proposal for DVB support in MC clearly shows it in my opinion.

The media controller model is supposed to describe the device hardware 
topology, or at least a logical view of that topology mapped to the operating 
system from a hardware point of view. Device nodes, on the other hand, are 
purely Linux concepts, and have nothing to do with the hardware topology. What 
we have tried to describe with the MEDIA_ENT_T_DEVNODE_V4L entity type is 
essentially a DMA engine. As DMA engines are mapped 1:1 to device nodes in 
V4L2, we have mixed the two concepts and have called those entities device 
nodes, while they should really have been called DMA engines.

One additional clue that made me realize this is that we now have device nodes 
for subdevs, which we don't report through the MC API. That's wrong, and 
should be fixed. We could simply consider that V4L2 subdevs, as they're V4L2 
entities, can use the media_entity_desc v4l union and report the device node 
major and minor there, but I think that would be a short-term solution.

Instead, I believe we should start describing our media entities based on the 
hardware point of view, and consider device nodes to be an entity property 
instead of an entity identity. In other words, a V4L2 DMA engine is not a 
device node by hardware nature, but has the property of exposing a device node 
to userspace. The same applies to other entities, such as V4L2 subdevices or 
DVB entities.

I've used the word property for a reason, as we've discussed numerous times in 
the past an MC API extension to report detailed entity properties. However, 
considering that exposing a device node is a very common property for 
entities, I believe it makes sense to report that information through 
media_entity_desc instead of requiring a separate, not implemented yet ioctl.

For those reasons, I believe that we should have a single struct dev in struct 
media_entity_desc used to report the "entity exposes a device node" property. 
This isn't linked to v4l, fb, dvb or alsa, and is independent from the entity 
type as such, so I wouldn't describe that property with subsystem-specific 
structures.

This doesn't preclude struct media_entity_desc from exposing subsystem-
specific information in v4l, fb, dvb or alsa structures, even though I 
currently believe that only core properties should be exposed through that 
structure, and subsystem-specific properties would likely not qualified, but 
that should be decided on a case-by-case basis. The struct dev, however, isn't 
a subsystem-specific property, and I would thus like it to be reported as 
such. A flag could also be used to report whether the entity has a device 
node, although that could be inferred from major:minor not being equal to 0:0.

With the above explanation hopefully clear, I believe that the following DVB 
entity types are wrong.

#define MEDIA_ENT_T_DEVNODE_DVB_FE      (MEDIA_ENT_T_DEVNODE + 4)
#define MEDIA_ENT_T_DEVNODE_DVB_DEMUX   (MEDIA_ENT_T_DEVNODE + 5)
#define MEDIA_ENT_T_DEVNODE_DVB_DVR     (MEDIA_ENT_T_DEVNODE + 6)
#define MEDIA_ENT_T_DEVNODE_DVB_CA      (MEDIA_ENT_T_DEVNODE + 7)
#define MEDIA_ENT_T_DEVNODE_DVB_NET     (MEDIA_ENT_T_DEVNODE + 8)

We should get rid of DEVNODE_ there.

Let's take http://linuxtv.org/downloads/presentations/cx231xx.ps as an 
example. If I understand it correctly, the frontend has a dedicated device 
node for control purposes (it has no DMA engine, no data can be transferred 
through that device node), while the demux and dvr have DMA engines. The demux 
can pass data to the dvr DMA engine, and also capture "raw" data directly. 
Please correct me if that's not correct.

The frontend should in my opinion be represented as a green box, not a yellow 
box, as it's a processing entity and not a DMA engine. It should, however, 
expose its device node property through struct dev.

The dvr, on the other side, is a DMA engine, for which a yellow box is thus 
correct. Its device node used for data transmission (and I suppose also some 
DMA-related configuration) should also be exposed through struct dev.

The demux is, if my understanding is correct, a hybrid beast, with both 
processing and DMA capabilities. I lack proper DVB knowledge here, but based 
on what I understand it might make sense to split it in two entities, one to 
handle the data processing capability, and the other one to handle the DMA 
engine. The processing entity could have one sink pad and two source pads, one 
connected to the dvr and the other one connected to the demux DMA engine 
entity.

This model departs from your proposal, but I think it would be a better base 
for future developments, for DVB but also other subsystems.
