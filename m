Hi Hans,

Well, the API that I propose here [1] is quite simple:

- a kernel-side API for defining CEC adapters drivers
- a character device with an ioctl() control path and read/write/poll 
data-path

Well, I don't think that tighting HDMI into V4L is such a good idea 
either. HDMI is also a separate bus and deserves its own subsystem and 
even subsystems (audio, video, HDCP, CEC). For instance, the STB I am 
working with does not use the V4L API at all, however, I would like to 
be able to integrate within the Linux HDMI stack once there, think about 
nvidia's driver too.

I can understand that you want to hold on your efforts on CEC while you 
want to get HDMI in, but don't make it entirely driven by Cisco and 
accept the community feedback.
