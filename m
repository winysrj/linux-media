Replying to my own post now.
I've tried using the svn version of the dvb drivers, but am still having the 
same problems.
Is there any use in me trying kernel 2.6.25, or has nothing relevant changed 
in there anyway?
As I understand it, according to the list archives, the problem ought to be 
fixed already, right?

Again, I'll be glad to assist in debugging, but I can't do it all on my own.

TIA
Luca
