Hello Oliver,

Yes, there is. I have not testet it as I am going to use MythTV, but for what I have read in some forums, many people have problems using that patch. This is why I decided to make a kernel implementation for my system. But I agree it could also be implemented as a wrapper application between frontend device and viewer application (the quick and dirty way) or native support in a userspace library (which will take some time until it is used in all DVB applications).

What I thought makes my solution attractive is, that you can even use dvbscan, szap etc. without modification, which works perfectly in my setup. But anyway the purpose might be too special to have it inside the kernel.

Regards,
Thomas
