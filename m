Yes, this is the solution that I had in mind when saying that this is 
doable.

I mean, if you have a struct type of which full declaration is available 
for some code, this code can access any memeber of it without any hacks, 
which is not something that we want to have in board files. The phy struct 
should be opaque for them.

OK, this can work. Again, just technically, because it's rather ugly.

Where would you want to have those phy_address arrays stored? There are no 
board files when booting with DT. Not even saying that you don't need to 
use any hacky schemes like this when you have DT that nicely specifies 
relations between devices.

Anyway, board file should not be considered as a method to exchange data 
between drivers. It should be used only to pass data from it to drivers, 
not the other way. Ideally all data in a board file should be marked as 
const and __init and dropped after system initialization.

Best regards,
Tomasz
