Hi Sakari,

My apologies, I should have reviewed this weeks ago. Please ping me next time,
this got buried under all the other patches, even though it was delegated to me.

Anyway, better late than never:

I agree. The document *only* applies to MC-controlled pipelines and that
should be made clear.

Indeed.

Please note that partial/broken frames can *also* happen at streaming *start*,
especially HDMI receivers often do that. And especially in the case of HDMI
(also DVI, VGA, etc) you can get frames that are too long or too short.

Particularly too long frames can be a nightmare (happens when due to a pin-bounce
when connecting an HDMI device the receiver misses the v-sync and so the frame
is suddenly twice the normal height). And yes, this really can happen.

I think you mean that it calls s_stream for the immediately connected subdevs,
not for subdevs that are one or more subdevs removed. I.e.:

S1 -> S2 -> S3 -> BRIDGE

BRIDGE calls s_stream for S3, S3 calls s_stream for S2 and S2 calls it for S1.

Right? The text above ('Additionally...') is a bit ambiguous.

Actually, it's always called from a video node, I think. So the bridge driver
initiates the first s_stream for a connected v4l2_subdev.

I guess 'source' is what you mean? But this could apply to sensors, but
also intermediate subdevs (e.g. stopping a scaler subdev can also cause
a partial frame even though the sensor gave a full frame).
