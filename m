vb2_parse_planes can be useful as a utility function that 'normal' drivers can 
call from the queue_setup. But vb2 should not parse the format directly, it
should just pass it on to the driver through the queue_setup function.

You also mention: "All frame-format fields like fourcc code, width, height, 
colorspace are only input from the user. If the user didn't fill them in, they 
should not be used."

I disagree with that. The user should fill in a full format description, just 
as with S/TRY_FMT. That's the information that the driver will use to set up 
the buffers. It could have weird rules like: if the fourcc is this, and the 
size is less than that, then we can allocate in this memory bank.

It is also consistent with REQBUFS: there too the driver uses a full format 
(i.e. the last set format).

I would modify queue_setup to something like this:

int (*queue_setup)(struct vb2_queue *q, struct v4l2_format *fmt,
                     unsigned int *num_buffers,
                     unsigned int *num_planes, unsigned int sizes[],
                     void *alloc_ctxs[]);

Whether fmt is left to NULL in the reqbufs case, or whether the driver has to 
call g_fmt first before calling vb2 is something that could be decided by what 
is easiest to implement.
