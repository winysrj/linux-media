I use kernel.org kernels exclusively.

No, if the parameters are a valid key, then -EINVAL is never the correct
thing for a kernel to return.  -EINVAL means "bad parameters",
and that's not an accurate description of a valid yet unmapped key.

And now we're stuck with it.  If that is how it works,
and userspace depends upon it (it does), then consider
it cast in stone.  Immutable by Linus's Law: don't break userspace.

Create a new ioctl() number for the new behaviour,
but preserve the old behaviour in exact form for
a suitable (multi-year) overlap period.
