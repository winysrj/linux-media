Race conditions are hard to track... probably the new code added some delay,
and this allowed the request_module() to finish his job.

If there's a race condition, then the proper fix is to lock the driver
until it is ready to receive a fops. Maybe we'll need a mutex to preventing
opening the device until it is completely initialized.

It is hard to tell, as Mark didn't provide us yet the dmesg info (at least
on the emails I was c/c), so I don't even know what device he has, and what
drivers are used.

It could be done, but then we'll need to pollute the existing input tools
with RC-specific stuff. For IR, there are some additional steps, like
the need to select the IR protocol, otherwise the keytable is useless.
Also, the keytable and persistent info is provided via /sys/class/rc/rc?/uevent.
So, the tool need to first read the RC class, check what keytable should be
associated with that device (based on a custom file), and load the proper
table.

Also, I'm currently working on a way to map media keys for remote controllers 
into X11 (basically, mapping them into the keyspace between 8-255, passing 
through Xorg evdev.c, and then mapping back into some X11 symbols). This way,
we don't need to violate the X11 protocol. (Yeah, I know this is hacky, but
while X11 cannot pass the full evdev keycode, at least the Remote Controllers
will work). This probably means that we may need to add some DBus logic
inside ir-keytable, when called via udev, to allow it to announce to X11.

Mauro
