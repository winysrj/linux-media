Hello Hans,

I am the original author of sit2 source code based on the reference code from silabs.
And we have signed NDA with silabs, it does not allow us to release the source code to the public.
I donot know it is permited or not when you do decompiling the binary code.

What happened between Konstantin Dimitrov and me, I think there is something misunderstand before.
But it looks it is not simple thing as I know he works for the competitor company.
I have some respect before, but now I think he is ridiculous and hostile.
As soon s his rumor release, we know our products really beat him.
What I want to tell him, please improve your products and make them stable.
The rumor just hurt him, not us. 
The customer start to do not believe him as they know the truth someday.

Finally, I have no relationship with Danny Griegs. He does not work for us and pay nothing to him.

BR,
Max
