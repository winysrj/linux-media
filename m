Hi!
 
I have a Terratec S7 (MKII) that I can connect and get it working (almost) with my Mythbuntu. The card get's detected, but I have problems scanning after channels, both with "scan" and with MythTV, it only finds one or maybe two transponders (there is no problem with dish, my old HVR4000 works great).
I have seen som olde posts about the same problem but no answers on them, and as there are no newer posts maybe there is a solution I've missed?
 
I'm running kernel 2.6.32 and latest v4l (I've tried s2-liplianin as well, same result), Firmware from Terratecs driverpack.
 
The card is the same as Terratec Skystar USB2.
 
Regards, and thanks for any help, Lars Fredriksson
