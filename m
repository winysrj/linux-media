This is good, but I have some comments. This document describes itself
as the common way for doing a device graph within the device tree, but
there is already a well established pattern for device graphs that is
used by the interrupts-extended, clocks and other bindings. Those are
all domain-specific bindings, but the core concept is one device uses
a resource provided by another device. The resource references construct
a graph independent from the natural FDT node graph. (ie. the interrupts
binding forms the interrupt graph. Same for the clock binding).

So, while this binding does describe a pattern for separate device
graphs, it is by no means the only common way of doing so.

I would like the document to acknowledge the difference from the
phandle+args pattern used elsewhere and a description of when it would
be appropriate to use this instead of a simpler binding.

I would argue that this pattern isn't necessarily restricted to data
flow descriptions. It wants to describe linkage between devices that are
sufficiently complex that the simple binding doesn't do the job.

Even if you don't want to declare the direction of data flow, there does
need to be some guidance as to how the binding is constructed. Does
device A point to device B? Or the other way around? Why would someone
choose one over the other? I don't want to see a situation where A & B
point to each other. Things get complex if the graph is allowed to be
cyclical.

I really don't like this aspect. It is far too easy to get wrong. Graphs
should be one direction only.
