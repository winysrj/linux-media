You don't want to give options to the device tree writer. It should work
one way and one way only. Every different combination is a different
permutation to get wrong. The only time we should be allowing for more
than one way to do it is when there is an existing binding that has
proven to be insufficient and it needs to be extended, such as was done
with interrupts-extended to deal with deficiencies in the interrupts
property.

Come now, when you're writing a driver you know if it will ever be
possible to have more than one port. If that is the case then the
binding should be specifically laid out for that. If there will never be
multiple ports and the binding is unambiguous, then, and only then,
should the shortcut be used, and only the shortcut should be accepted.

Parsing the binding now consists of a ladder of 'ifs' that gives three
distinct different behaviours for no benefit. You don't want that in
bindings because it makes it more difficult to get the parsing right in
the first place, and to make sure that all users parse it in the same
way (Linux, U-Boot, BSD, etc). Bindings should be as absolutely simple
as possible.

Just to be clear, I have no problem with having the option in the
pattern, but the driver needs to be specific about what layout it
expects.
