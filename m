OK. The led-output-cnt property should be put in each sub-node, as the
number of the current outputs each LED can be connected to is variable.

New version:

  Optional properties for child nodes:
+led-sources-cnt : Number of device current outputs the LED is connected to.
+- led-sources : List of device current outputs the LED is connected to. The
+               outputs are identified by the numbers that must be defined
+               in the LED device binding documentation.
  - label : The label for this LED.  If omitted, the label is
    taken from the node name (excluding the unit address).
