Huh? It's just the initialization function that is bogus. I'm not removing the tda8425
from tvaudio. If you look at that function you'll see that it has some special code
when used with an out-of-tree riva TV driver that hasn't been maintained since 6 years
and no longer works with tvaudio after all the i2c core probing changes. So it's just
dead code now.
