In time, I'll update the description.

I'll work on the xc2028 driver to fix it. It seems better than applying
a hack there. I prefer to not remove the code that puts it in power down
mode, as some em28xx devices are known to have power heat problems.

So, keeping xc3028 energized can reduce a lot its lifetime on such
devices.

Mauro
