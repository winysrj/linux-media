For the sake of not loosing this patch again, I've applied it as-is. I hope I
got the latest version. It is hard to track patches that aren't got by patchwork.

I agree with Trent's proposals for optimizing the code: It is better to just
call xc3028_winfast1800h_callback() if you ever need to reset xc3028 before the
tuner driver. I suspect, however, that you don't need to do such reset, since
the tuner driver will do it during its initialization, especially if you've
properly initialized the gpio lines.



Cheers,
