Yeah, it's an udev bug. It really is that simple.

This is why I'm complaining. There's no way in hell we're fixing this
in kernel space, unless we call the "bypass udev entirely because the
maintainership quality of it has taken a nose dive". Yes, I've seen
some work-around patches, but quite frankly, I think it would be
absolutely insane for the kernel to work around the fact that udev is
buggy.

The fact is, doing request_firmware() from within module_init() is
simply the easiest approach for some devices.

Now, at the same time, I do agree that network devices should
generally try to delay it until ifup time, so I'm not arguing against
that part per se. I do think that when possible, people should aim to
delay firmware loading until as late as reasonable.

But as you point out, it's simply not always reasonable, and the media
people are clearly hitting the cases where it's just painful. Now,
those cases seem to be happily fairly *rare*, so this isn't getting a
ton of attention, but we should fix it.

Because the udev behavior is all pain, no gain. There's no *reason*
for udev to be pissy about this. And it didn't use to be.
