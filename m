A similar argument can be made for any particular feature or device that
just works when the functionality is enabled :)

It is not a need.  I simply observed that after the IR_ to RC_ rename
there was another set of drivers being built which I did not ask for.

It struck me as odd that because basic keyboard/mouse support was
enabled I also got support for DTV card remote controls.

I don't think there are any other driver subsystems enabling themselves
based on something as generic as INPUT (as a dependency it is just fine,
obviously).

Overall, it just seems like the wrong setting to me.  Is there another
predicate available that makes a bit more sense for RC_CORE other than
INPUT?  Something related to the TV or DTV cards perhaps?


Take care,
