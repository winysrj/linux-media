Subject: [PATCH v3 0/9] Renesas Capture Engine Unit (CEU) V4L2 driver
Date: Thu,  4 Jan 2018 17:03:08 +0100

Hello everyone,
    this is the third round for Renesas CEU unit.

Patch now based on v4.15-rc6, a base tag for testing is available at:
git://jmondi.org/linux tag:v4.15-rc6-ceu-v3-base for the interested ones.

Just closed review comments received from Laurent, Geert and Fabio on v2,
not a huge changelog in this iteration, compared to v1->v2 one.

Hopefully we're close to final version, I just would like to hear about
runtime_pm management, as I have noticed in Sakari's review of other patches
I may have been using runtime_pm a bit naively in this driver. Just want a
confirmation this is ok.

Tested on RZ with GR-Peach and ov7670 and SH4 with Migo-R platform with ov7725.

Thanks

v2->v3:
- Improved DT bindings removing standard properties (pinctrl- ones and
  remote-endpoint) not specific to this driver and improved description of
  compatible strings
- Remove ov772x's xlkc_rate property and set clock rate in Migo-R board file
- Made 'xclk' clock private to ov772x driver in Migo-R board file
- Change 'rstb' GPIO active output level and changed ov772x and tw9910 drivers
  accordingly as suggested by Fabio
- Minor changes in CEU driver to address Laurent's comments
- Moved Migo-R setup patch to the end of the series to silence 0-day bot
- Renamed tw9910 clock to 'xti' as per video decoder manual
- Changed all SPDX identifiers to GPL-2.0 from previous GPL-2.0+

v1->v2:
 - DT
 -- Addressed Geert's comments and added clocks for CEU to mstp6 clock source
 -- Specified supported generic video iterfaces properties in dt-bindings and
    simplified example

 - CEU driver
 -- Re-worked interrupt handler, interrupt management, reset(*) and capture
    start operation
 -- Re-worked querycap/enum_input/enum_frameintervals to fix some
    v4l2_compliance failures
 -- Removed soc_camera legacy operations g/s_mbus_format
 -- Update to new notifier implementation
 -- Fixed several comments from Hans, Laurent and Sakari

 - Migo-R
 -- Register clocks and gpios for sensor drivers in Migo-R setup
 -- Updated sensors (tw9910 and ov772x) drivers headers and drivers to close
    remarks from Hans and Laurent:
 --- Removed platform callbacks and handle clocks and gpios from sensor drivers
 --- Remove g/s_mbus_config operations
