Sorry right, forgot to mention adv7180.c needs to implement
.g_skip_frames. The below patch is the right idea.

Yes, FIM is another solution for dealing with the unstable initial
bt.656 sync codes. But with the current drawback that the EOF
method is subject to irq latency error, so it's possible to trigger
false FIM events by, say attaching a USB device creating a flurry
of IO. Also FIM requires participation from userland (send a stream
restart in response to the FIM event), and a gstreamer pipeline,
e.g. v4l2src won't do this.

The push-back was not about using g_skip_frames. It was in
reaching through the media graph to search for the backend
sensor.

Sure, I will look into trying again. It would have to be a chained
approach, similar to how .s_steam is chained.

It does but with the above drawbacks mentioned.

I'm not using a patched version, referencing controls by
name has been part of v4l2-ctl for a long time AFAIK.
But remember FIM controls are only available from the
ipu_csi capture device nodes ATM, not the scaling/CSC/rotation
ipu_ic_prp pipelines.
