Ok, I finally had the chance to test with a HVR-930C, but it seems my
device () is different.
It has no slave device at i2c address 0x82, so I can't test this part.
Btw, which slave device is this ?

Removing the temporary switches to bus A makes no difference (as expected).

Do you want me to send patches to remove these writes ?
Which i2c speed settings do you suggest for the HVR-930C and the
HTC-Stick (board settings:
EM28XX_I2C_FREQ_400_KHZ, code overwrites it with EM28XX_I2C_FREQ_100_KHZ) ?
