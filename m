Never been there lately, so I don't know nothing about it. Maybe it's 
just due to the fact, that the grown world of German broadcasting tends 
to be rather complex. ;)

Not to mention radio services, which apart from classical FM (VHF) and 
AM (medium wave, long wave and short wave) do include DAB, radio over 
DVB-T and DVB-S and a lot of experiementing like "HD radio" etc.

Okay, now I got that ;)

Well, Berlin, Hamburg and Bremen are not a good example, because 
actually they are a Bundesland ;) But I got the point, you tried to make.

I doubt, that apart from a handful of people, a simgle person has a 
complete overview and knowledge in regard to every little broadcasting 
station in Germany. Just remember, that there a also a lot of local 
stations that a distributed via cable only. For instance all the 
"Offener Kanal" (citizen tv, may I call it so?) stations.

Oh, thanks for the information (and correction). As I am not longer able 
to use satellite / DVB-S, I've lost track on the developments there.

Would be interting, if you find out any information. As I've searched 
for a detailed list, I've come across:

   http://dvb-t.the-media-channel.com/

which has a very uptodate and detailed listing, which I checked for 
Leipzig (including the SLM city multiplex!):

http://dvb-t.the-media-channel.com/mitteldeutschland/dvb-t-leipzig.html

These listing contain a lot of technical information (I was really 
amazed how detailed).

I would not expect, that this VHF Ch 9 will change in the next months. 
No news about that.

That only the 3 PSB multiplexes are listed may be due to the fact, that 
die technical provider for the "Leipzig 1" mux is not Media Broadcast 
GmbH (former T-Systems Media&Broadcast GmbH (M&B), now part of TDF from 
France ... has sort of a monopol on DVB-T in Germany) but MUGLER AG.

The network uses exsiting buildings / infrastructure, low power 
transmitters and rotating field antennas (which is quite unique for 
DVB-T in Germany, a least the website says so).

Okay. Thanks for the advice. I am wrong on that and you are right. 
Thanks also to Herrmann ;)

I need to do some homework too, it seems so. :(

Due to the federal structure of the broadcasting system which one 
public-law broadcaster and a "Landesmedienanstalt" in the lead, there 
will obviously never be a nationwide identical strucure. At least I 
think so.

Well, I think that a lot of metropolitan and also small city areas (down 
to 10.000 inhabitants) do have access, at least in part, to cable tv & 
radio.

Former Bundespost invested heavily in such infrastructure in the 80ies 
and 90ies, which does also mean, that some parts of it may be 
technically not very uptodate. As Telekom had to sell (at least a large 
part of?) that business, it is now divided into a few big and a lot more 
smaller companies.

You could do some research on the respective websites, say

Kabel Deutschland
http://www.kabeldeutschland.de

Primacom
http://www.primacom.de/

etc.

Even a city like Tröglitz (some relatives of me live there, 2816 
inhabitants according to Wikipedia) has access to cable.

So then I'll try to do some research and "verification" ... sometimes it 
is enough to read the local news ;)
