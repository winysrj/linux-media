Judging by the silence I'm guessing that's a "negative"  ;-)

I actually had a closer read of this...
http://www.kernellabs.com/blog/?p=1339

So even if I donated a card I guess that's not going to compensate you
nearly enough to get analogue a/v-in at least partially working?

So it seems I went for a "bells & whistles" card which may never be 
fully supported. I seem to recall having the same experience
with a prior card, I wonder if I'll ever learn!

Are there any tuners with similar raw analogue capture/encoding
abilities (ideally component-in) that you do support more completely or
intend to?

Or should I be looking at dedicated video capture devices for better
linux-media support?

Thank-you
