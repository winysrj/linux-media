There is no point whatsoever in committing a driver and then replacing it
with another which has a different feature set. I'm not going to do that.

One option that might be much more interesting is to add your driver to
staging with a TODO stating that the field support should be added to
the mainline driver. So the code is there and having it in staging makes
it a bit easier to do the migration. And if nothing is done about it
after 1-2 years, then it is removed again since that indicates that there
is not enough interest in the features specific to your driver version.

I'm not sure if Mauro would go for it, but I think this is a fair option.
