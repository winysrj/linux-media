I fixed what was possible by moving af9033 and af9035 configurations for 
the state. That at least resolves most significant issues - like your 
fc0011 tuner callback.

But there is still some stuff in "static struct 
dvb_usb_device_properties" which cannot be fixed. Like dynamic remote 
configuration, dual mode, etc. I am going to make RFC for those maybe 
even this week after some analysis is done.
