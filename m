Slightly tangential to the ongoing discussion, but still ... I think that 
even "all network drivers should delay firmware loading to ifup time" 
might be too general.

I would expect that there are network cards which require firmware to be 
present for PHY to work, right? On such cards, if you want to have link 
detection even on interfaces that are down (so that things like ifplugd 
can detect the link presence and configure the interface), ifup is too 
late.

I admit I haven't checked whether there actually are such cards out there, 
but it doesn't seem to be completely unrealistic to me.
