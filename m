I saw the thread, but no news since quite some time, and trust me, 
searching on the internet it seems a lot of people are getting the 900H 
instead of the 900, it is the hauppage fault here.

That's why i got hauppauge card, but well it was the 900H one.

That's a good new, i can still get that card, probably i can help 
testing the driver.

Yeah, i need to get an analog USB stick to work under Linux, because i 
replaced my desktop with a small imax mini (which i got the windows 
refund for it) but it is a very small PC that doesn't have PCI card.

So basically if i can get the analog part of the PCTV hybrid pro or the 
Win TV hvr900h to work under Linux that will be awesome.
