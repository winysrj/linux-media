Some drivers call vb2_dma_contig_set_max_seg_size() and some call 
dma_coerce_mask_and_coherent(). Both are likely needed, the former telling the 
DMA mapping API about the maximum size of a scatter-gather chunk that the 
device supports (when using vb2-dma-contig that size should really be the full 
address space supported by the device as we want DMA-contiguous buffers), and 
the latter telling the DMA mapping API about the address space that is 
accessible through DMA (and thus in which address range buffers must be 
placed).

I wonder why the omap3isp driver works without a 
vb2_dma_contig_set_max_seg_size() call. Sakari, any insight ?
