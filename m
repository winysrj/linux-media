Some people thought that it would be nice to have the macros rather than 
the inlined field initializations, especially since there is no flag for 
write.  A separate question is whether an array of one element is useful, 
or whether one should systematically use & on a simple variable of the 
structure type.  I'm open to suggestions about either point.
