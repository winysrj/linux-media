Those are USB controller issues. The uvcvideo driver submits URBs with the 
URB_ISO_ASAP transfer flag, so the controller should not fail to schedule 
them.

Are the kernel panics related to uvcvideo ? There's one known bug introduced 
between v3.2 and v3.3 and fixed (before v3.3) in commit 
8e57dec0454d8a3ba987d18b3ab19922c766d4bc.
