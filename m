I could look into it myself but is there any documentation on omapdrm?

 From what I found libdrm should probably be used but information about 
it's API is really scarce:
https://dvdhrm.wordpress.com/2012/09/13/linux-drm-mode-setting-api/
http://dvdhrm.wordpress.com/2012/12/21/advanced-drm-mode-setting-api/
http://virtuousgeek.org/blog/index.php/jbarnes/2011/10/31/writing_stanalone_programs_with_egl_and_

The last one seems focused on OpenGL so I don't think it applies.

Are there any good sources to learn about this? Or maybe some pointers 
on where to start with reading source code?
