In Nokia kernel, there are just /dev/video0 and /dev/video1. When I open
first I see back camera, second front camera. No media-ctl nor any other
reconfiguration is needed. So not Nokia nor hw complexity is reason...

Ok, I agree. But I really would like to see just two video devices and
all those route configuration in kernel...

Looks like it is part of v4l-utils package. At least in git:
https://git.linuxtv.org/v4l-utils.git/tree/utils/media-ctl

> It does not seem to be in debian 7 or debian 8...

I do not see it in debian too, but there is some version in ubuntu:
http://packages.ubuntu.com/trusty/media-ctl

So you can compile ubuntu dsc package, should work on debian.
