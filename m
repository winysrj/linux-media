It's not a problem for special cases, I just want to make sure that
the common case works well enough that we don't need too many special
cases.

So far, this has worked well enough.

That is true. If there are hard requirements of the hardware, we
can and should definitely document them in the device tree. It's
totally fine to describe the layout of memory banks and affinity
of devices to specific banks where that exists in hardware.

The part that should not be in the device tree is a specific location
of a buffer inside the bank when there is no hardware reason for
the location.

I guess it's also fine to describe requirements per device regarding
how much contiguous memory it will need to operate, if you can provide
that number independent of the application you want to run. The early
boot code can walk the device tree and ensure that the region is
large enough.

Yes, that is the obvious conflict. My main interest is to have something
that works not just for your hardware but works as good as possible on
the widest possible range of hardware, which may mean it may run not quite
as good in some of the cases.
