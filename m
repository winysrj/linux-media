LNA control is device specific. I fail to see code optimization with any
GPIO that it is used only as a simple switch.

Ok, if you're doing something more complex at a GPIO, like implementing an
UART protocol or I2C (cx231xx does I2C via GPIO), then I can see an advantage
on using a library, as the UART/I2C code can be written on a very generic
way, using the GPIOLIB to connect the generic code to the device specific
GPIO.

There are lots of reported cases of devices that got their
eeprom corrupted. We even wrote a tool to allow recovering such damaged
eeproms.

Yet, an eeprom data is something that can be recovered (if the dump of the
old eeprom can be obtained from someone else or from a previous dump).
A melted device can't be recovered at all.

Well, I'm a little pragmatic with it. Basically, if you think it is worth
using it, well, write a patch converting from the way we currently do
to gpiolib, and let's see. If the end result is better than before, I'm
OK with that.
