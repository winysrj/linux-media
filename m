OK, as long as someone checked, I'm happy.

Heh, I didn't call our security vacillations a dizzying ride for
nothing.  I know the goal once was to try to run a distro without root
daemons (which is what required the capabilities stuff).  I'm actually

care aren't all moving in different directions.
