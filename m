The answer was responsive to the question, a couple of links to software 
which might serve. I would think your going off about it was further 
off-topic, it certainly didn't help the O.P. any. When someone ends a 
question with "please help" I would assume that any answer would be 
better than "we're working on it." Answering an on-topic question with a 
short list of links is hardly "spamming" or even advertising, it's 
called being polite and helpful.

I would rather run commercial software on Linux that open source on 
Windows, thanks, if those are the choices.

After several months of looking I have yet to find any video app that a 
typical office worker can use. Something no more complex than xawtv, 
which has been running fine on FC4 and FC6 for these folks. I would 
certainly consider a commercial solution rather than have them go back 
to the dark side of the force and Windows-7.
