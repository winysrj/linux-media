Hi,

At FOSDEM on the 31st of january and the 1st of February 2015, there 
will be another graphics DevRoom. URL: https://fosdem.org/2015/

The focus of this DevRoom is of course the same as last year, namely:
* Graphics drivers: from display to media to 3d drivers, both in kernel 
  or userspace. Be it part of DRM, KMS, (direct)FB, V4L, Xorg, Mesa...
* Input drivers: kernel and userspace.
* Windowing systems: X, Wayland, Mir, directFB, ...
* Even colour management and other areas which i might have overlooked 
  above are accepted.

Slots are 50 minutes long, and scheduled hourly. This partly to avoid 
confusion and people running all over the place all the time. As a 
speaker, you do not have to fill your whole hour, gaps are never wasted 
time.

Slots will be handed out on a first come, first serve basis. The best 
slots will go to those who apply the earliest. The amount of slots is 
currently not known yet, but i expect there to be around 16 available (8 
on each day), so act quickly.

Talk Submission:
----------------

Like last year, the pentabarf system will be used for talk submission. 
It is not perfect from a devroom organizer and talk submitters usability 
point-of-view, but the fosdem organizers are working on it. It is 
however workable and it ended up working out pretty well last year.

https://penta.fosdem.org/submission/FOSDEM15

Remember that FOSDEM is not like XDC, it's not some 50 odd people 
meeting with a sliding schedule which only gets filled out on the last 
day. Upwards of 8000 people are visiting this event, and most of them 
get a printed booklet or use the schedule on the FOSDEM website or an 
app for their phone to figure out what to watch or participate in next. 
So please put some effort in your talk submission and details.

Since this an open source community event, please refrain from turning 
in a talk that is a pure corporate or product commercial. Also, if you 
are unsure on whether you can come or not (this is FOSDEM, why are you 
not there anyway?), please wait with submitting your talk. Submitting a 
talk and then not turning up because you could not be bothered is a 
sure-fire way to get larted and then to never be allowed to talk again.

As for deadlines, i hope to have a pretty much complete schedule between 
christmas and the new year. The rockhard printed schedule deadline is 
probably January 9th, after that you will not be featured in the booklet 
and you will have a lot less visitors. I will hopefully be able to lock 
down entries and descriptions after that date.

Don't count on this deadline: first come first serve! There are perhaps 
only 16 slots. And the worst slots will be assigned to those who come 
last. Do you really want to talk on saturday at 10:00 when people are 
still in zombie mode after the beer event, if they are there at all?

Use your account from last year, so you can try to recycle some of your 
data from last year. If you have forgotten your password, then you can

Necessary information:

Below is a list of what i need to see filled in when you apply for a

are only around 16 slots.
