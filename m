from your Wiki:
http://linuxtv.org/wiki/index.php/DVB-T_USB_Devices#TwinhanDTV_Twister_.287049.29_DVB-T
"In germany a similar device seems to be sold as dnt EuroMini200 [127]."


But at "http://skinflint.co.uk/a193550.html"
write that "Euromin 200" is compatible with linux.

I have a "Digitune-S" that they say is equal to "Euromin 200", then
solution is to use this device with my Linux?

Ciao
