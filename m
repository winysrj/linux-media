In my understanding they will start new DVB-T2 standard and due to that 
new devices are needed. There is no DVB-T2 devices publicly sold 
currently. Few vendors like Pace and Humax have public prototypes.

Basically new demodulator chips are needed and I don't know if there is 
any publicly released.

Finland will also start DVB-T2 SFN (Single Frequency Network) with h.264 
during next year. There is two VHF muxes currently reserved for that.
