Buffer index is not enough as it's local to a DMA engine and applications,
while frame sequence is unique throughout whole pipeline.

Perhaps yes, I don't have strong opinion on how much knowing an exact range

Or do we make it 0..100 and assume 0 is impossible (insignificant) value ?

OK. But still value range for them is 0..9, isn't it ?

We don't necessarily need to think about v4l2 application as an end user
program.

We don't need to export anything, i.e. no additional effort is needed.
As you may know, each control has min/max/step value associated with it and
each driver must initialize it to sane values. Control properties can be
queried by applications
(http://linuxtv.org/downloads/v4l-dvb-apis/vidioc-queryctrl.html).

This is the only overhead for applications, to query the controls. What
they usually normally do, in order to initialize control panels, etc.

Perhaps name "v4l2_fd_object" would fit better for this type of data.

More important is what is returned from face detector. In all cases I'm aware those
are rectangles. The application may do anything with the data

So maybe:

struct v4l2_point {
	__s32	x;
	__s32	y;
};

struct v4l2_size {
	__s32	w;
	__s32	h;
};

struct v4l2_fd_object {
	__u32			flags;
	__s16           	confidence;
	__s16           	angle;
	struct v4l2_size	size;
	struct v4l2_point	center;
	__u16			reserved[4];
} __packed;

For flags we might need something like:
#define V4L2_FD_OBJ_RECTANGLE  (1 << 0)
...

OR

struct v4l2_fd_object {
	union {
		struct v4l2_rect rect;
		__u32	data[4];
	}u;
} __packed;

And I'm not sure if we need parameters like confidence or angle in v4l2_fd_object
data structure. Isn't it enough to have such properties per struct
v4l2_fd_detection only ? In your driver you don't even use other struct
v4l2_obj_detection instances than 'face'. It's rather significant waste of memory.

We could add smile_level and blink_level to struct v4l2_fd_result.
And then keep the two above flags or not.

"detection" doesn't really say if it is face detection process' configuration
or its result. I believe we can do better than
v4l2_fd_detection/v4l2_obj_detection pair.

We can still add struct v4l2_fd_shape in place of the reserved[]
array in future if needed. But something else than v4l2_fd_shape may be
needed, so plain u32 array looked more reasonable to me.

IMHO we can use attribute packed to make sure the structure layout is same
on all architectures. And design the data structure so performance loss
is minimal, i.e. no weird padding is necessary.

The face detector output structure might then be:

struct v4l2_fd_detection {	
	struct v4l2_fd_object	left_eye;
	struct v4l2_fd_object	right_eye;
	struct v4l2_fd_object	mouth;
	struct v4l2_fd_object	face;
	__s32           	confidence;
	__s32           	angle;
	__u32			flags;
	__u32			smile_level;
	__u32			blink_level;
	__u32                   reserved[37];
} __packed;


But I can't stop myself from thinking it's better to use the v4l2 event API
for passing FD output data between drivers and applications. You basically
reimplemented it in patches 6/7, 7/7. The "only" issue is that event type
specific payload size in struct v4l2_event is only 64 bytes and maximum count
of detected faces per frame isn't constant API wide and hardware dependant...
