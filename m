OK.

There is no tree, but could be birds.

Measuring the strength and SNR is not so easy now. My SAT receiver
always says strength 70% and SNR 80%. My new Nova S Plus cards always
report strength 97% and SNR 99%. Only my TT 1500s reported reasonable
numbers like strength 63-80% and SNR 75-90%.

In the end, I think overall strength and SNR is not my problem. I always
get a lock. It's the glitches that happen every now and then.

I am not recording x264 at the moment, meaning I have no DVB-S2 card.

Thanks for the informations.
