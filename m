Hello whomever at Redhat who is managing this list,

Its now been over two years since the Linux Media Mailing List was set 
up and it, indeed, has become well established  
(http://www.linuxtv.org/news.php?entry=2009-01-06.mchehab).   While most 
V4L-DVB community participants have transitioned over to the LMML, 
unfortunately, (likely from those unaware of the change) a fair number 
of user messages are still getting posted to the now essentially 
deprecated video4linux mailing list.  It is a diservice to those folks 
to continue allowing messages to make it on to the v4l list, as most of 
them will go unnoticed (as, as mentioned, most users in a position to 
respond to the sender have already abandoned this list in favour of the 
new LMML).

Could we please effectively wind down the video4linux by the end of this 
month  -- perhaps by way of setting up an auto notification response to 
any future submitter to the video4linux mailing list that their message 
should instead be sent to the LMML instead (perhaps even setting up a 
courtesy redirect of their message to the LMML for them) ?

Cheers
