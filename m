Swearing won't get you anywhere. There's (to my knowledge) nobody registered 
to this list who has administrative permissions needed to modify the 
subscribers list.

Unsubscription information is available at the end of every e-mail you get 
from the list. If you can't understand them, you could ask politely. If you're 
not successful following the procedure you could report the problem politely 
with enough *details* to allow someone to help you. If you still can't 
unsubscribe the footer also has a link to the mailing list manager website, 
which includes a contact e-mail address. If you can't unsubscribe despite all 
that information maybe you should stop using e-mail.
