I really thought that this youngster-mistake of mien (these
drivers+framework date from 2004-2006 and there it worked just fine)
had been fixed some years ago. 

Seems not the be the case :-(.

However, I'm happy to see people using these devices now. Even
though I don't have them anymore (or never had them in the first place).

Mauro, could you please bring me up to speed or remind when and
where you did changes in this regard? I got a little bit rusty
regarding linux-media, but I'd be happy to help.

regards,
