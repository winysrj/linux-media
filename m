We do it the other way around in OMAP DSS. It's the displays the user is
interested in, so we enumerate the displays, and if the user wants to
enable a display, we then follow the links from the display towards the
SoC, configuring and enabling the components on the way.

I don't have a strong opinion on the direction, I think both have their
pros. In any case, that's more of a driver model thing, and I'm fine
with linking in the DT outwards from the SoC (presuming the
double-linking is not ok, which I still like best).

In that case there's possibly the issue I mentioned in other email in
this thread: an encoder can be used in both a display and a capture
pipeline. Describing the links outwards from CPU means that sometimes
the encoder's input port is pointed at, and sometimes the encoder's
output port is pointed at.

That's possibly ok, but I think Grant was of the opinion that things
should be explicitly described in the binding documentation: either a
device's port must contain a 'remote-endpoint' property, or it must not,
but no "sometimes". But maybe I took his words too literally.

Then there's also the audio example Philipp mentioned, where there is no
clear "outward from Soc" direction for the link, as the link was
bi-directional and between two non-SoC devices.
