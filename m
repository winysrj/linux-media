Dear Friend,

How are you with your family? I hope fine. I'm happy to inform you about my success in getting those funds transferred under the cooperation of a new partner from India, Presently I’m in India, meanwhile I didn't forget your past efforts to assist me in transferring those funds despite that it failed us some how. Now contact my secretary in Benin Republic West Africa through her e-mail id (lucynnani@hotmail.fr)  ask her to send you the ATM CARD worth’s sum of ($250,000.00 US Dollars) which I kept for your compensation for all the past efforts and attempts to assist me in this transaction. so feel free and get in touch with my secretary Ms. Lucy Nnani she will send the ATM CARD to you.

Regards,
Samuel Amar.
