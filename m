Please don't cc-flood (is that the correct way to name it?:)) your
recipients ;)

To answer any questions that were posed at me, I have not been using the
card much, but were able to get analog picture (no sound) with it using
Ubuntu 8.10 stock kernel - I'm guessing 2.6.27 at the time.

I might give it a try some time, once dvb becomes more popular over here
I believe.

Stay tuned.
