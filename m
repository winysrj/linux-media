Just as I sent my reply I realized that my notes w.r.t. field handling
were incomplete. So I'll try to clarify it below.

Given the fact that very few drivers do FIELD_ALTERNATE it makes sense to convert
it in the driver to FIELD_INTERLACED format, which is much more common. While
normally format conversions in the kernel are discouraged I think it is not an
issue here: the data has to be copied into the buffer anyway, so why not copy it
in a way that makes more sense.

Doing this will give buffers that use FIELD_INTERLACED and have as height the full
frame size (480 or 576, depending on the standard).

Correction: this should be FIELD_INTERLACED.

BTW, one thing that is missing in this driver is that the timestamp isn't
set in the buffer. The correct sequence in usbtv_image_chunk() is:

             buf->vb.v4l2_buf.field = V4L2_FIELD_INTERLACED;
             buf->vb.v4l2_buf.sequence = usbtv->sequence++;
	     v4l2_get_timestamp(&buf->vb.v4l2_buf.timestamp);
             vb2_set_plane_payload(&buf->vb, 0, size);
             vb2_buffer_done(&buf->vb, VB2_BUF_STATE_DONE);
