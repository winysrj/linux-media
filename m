My concern is about the policy to adding heaps, will you accept
"customs" heap per
platforms ? per devices ? or only generic ones ?
If you are too strict, we will have lot of out-of-tree heaps and if
you accept of of them
it will be a nightmare to maintain....

Another point is how can we put secure rules (like selinux policy) on
heaps since all the allocations
go to the same device (/dev/ion) ? For example, until now, in Android
we have to give the same
access rights to all the process that use ION.
It will become problem when we will add secure heaps because we won't
be able to distinguish secure
processes to standard ones or set specific policy per heaps.
Maybe I'm wrong here but I have never see selinux policy checking an
ioctl field but if that
exist it could be a solution.
