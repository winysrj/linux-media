Hi all,

This is the tentative agenda for the media workshop on November 8, 2012.
If you have additional things that you want to discuss, or something is wrong
or incomplete in this list, please let me know so I can update the list.

- Explain current merging process (Mauro)
- Open floor for discussions on how to improve it (Mauro)
- Write down minimum requirements for new V4L2 (and DVB?) drivers, both for
  staging and mainline acceptance: which frameworks to use, v4l2-compliance,
  etc. (Hans Verkuil)
- V4L2 ambiguities (Hans Verkuil)
- TSMux device (a mux rather than a demux): Alain Volmat
- dmabuf status, esp. with regards to being able to test (Mauro/Samsung)
- Device tree support (Guennadi, not known yet whether this topic is needed)
- Creating/selecting contexts for hardware that supports this (Samsung, only
  if time is available)

For those whose name is behind a topic: please prepare something before the
meeting.

We have currently 17 or 18 attendees of a maximum of 25, so there is room
for a few more people.

Regards,

	Hans
