Thanks, going to give that a try.

In this case I can comfort you, the looks amdgpu needs to grab during 
GPU reset are the reservation lock of the VM page tables. I have strong 
doubt that i915 will ever hold those.

Could be that we run into problems because Thread A hold lock 1 tries to 
take lock 2, then i915 holds 2 and our reset path needs 1.

Ok, what exactly do you mean with cross-release checking?

Yes, that is also something I worry about.
