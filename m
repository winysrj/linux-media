Don't do that. This piece of code is old, and it was added there 
before the em28xx driver. Originally, the ir-i2c-kbd were used by
bttv and saa7134 drivers and the code there were auto-detecting the
I2C IR hardware decoding chips that used to be very common on media
devices. I'm almost sure that the original device that started using
this code is this model:

drivers/media/pci/bt8xx/bttv-cards.c:             .name           = "Typhoon TView RDS + FM Stereo / KNC1 TV Station RDS",

That's why it is called as KNC1, but there are other cards that use
it as well. I think I have one bttv using it. Not sure.

The routine on em28xx is a fork of the original one, that was changed
to work with the devices there.

FYI, most of those I2C IR codes are provided by some generic 8-bits
micro-processor, generally labeled with weird names, like KS007.
The code inside those can be different, depending on the firmware
inside, and also its I2C address.

That's one of the reasons why we moved the code that used to be
inside ir-i2c-kbd into the drivers that actually use it, like
em28xx: this way, we can track its usage and fix, as the remaining
get_key code inside-i2c-kbd are old, auto-detected, nobody knows
precisely what devices use them, and the current developers don't own
the hardware where they're used.

In other words, please, don't touch at the get_key routines inside
ir-kbd-i2c. If you find a bug, please fix at em28xx-input instead, if
you find a bug.
