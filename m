I've been attempting to use an HVR-1500q expresscard in linux.  The
development of the driver looks promising.  The trouble is that I am
currently living in a fairly remote valley where there is no TV
reception, so I can't actually tell if the ATSC or NTSC tuners are
working.  I'll be spending next week near some larger cities so I will
be able to test it further.  All I can tell you now is that the card
is detected correctly and the firmware appears to load properly.
