So if I understand you correctly, the reservation changes in TTM are 
motivated by the
fact that otherwise, in the generic reservation code, lockdep can only be
annotated for a trylock and not a waiting lock, when it *is* in fact a 
waiting lock.

I'm completely unfamiliar with setting up lockdep annotations, but the 
only place a
deadlock might occur is if the trylock fails and we do a 
wait_for_unreserve().
Isn't it possible to annotate the call to wait_for_unreserve() just like 
an interruptible waiting lock
(that is always interrupted, but at least any deadlock will be catched?).
