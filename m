on the FQ1216AME.pdf I read it has an on average 10dB LNA for extra high
sensitivity and that there must be taken care not to apply to large
signals.

This obviously results in this recommendation for IF TOP.

* For optimum setting between overall picture quality and signal
handling to fulfill CISPR20/EN55020
requirements, we recommend to use these settings below .
 However we recommend customers have the choice to make their own
setting based on their own
application. For example, for cable TV networks, the TOP has to be â€“4 dB
or lower to prevent intermodulation problems.

Likely this is the same on the MK5 and with this background it is clear
what Dmitry is talking about these tuners! Nobody mentioned the LNA so
far.

Also, on a first look at the FQ1216LME MK3 pdf, loopthrough is active.

And on that one.

Important !!
The FQ1216LME uses the narrowband mode. So the internal AGC mode must be
switched off. This
is done by setting the I AGC to 0 by setting AL2=1, AL1=1, AL0=0.
At the same time the bits C0 to C6 (IF TOP) must be set according to the
table on Pg16.
This disables the internal AGC detector and activates the narrowband
AGC. The TOP is
recommended to be set to +4 dB in order to fulfil EN55020.
See the programming examples on Pg 19.

So we have tuners needing at least the tda9887 "adjust option" and
better have their own entry. Seeing now also port2=1 for the AME MK4
except for Secam L', all makes sense.

Cheers,
Hermann
