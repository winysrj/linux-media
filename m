Why do you need to implement it? Just forward the requests to the machine
with the real driver.

Kernel code is GPLv2. You can use its code on a GPLv2 licensed library.

See libv4l, at v4l2-utils.git (at linuxtv.org).

And I can't see any advantage on yours ;) Putting something that belongs
to userspace into kernelspace just because it is easier to re-use the
existing code inside the kernel is not a good argument.

Don't get me wrong but if you want to submit a code to be merged
on any existing software (being open source or not), you should be
prepared to defend your code and justify the need for it to the
other developers.
