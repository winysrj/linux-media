Hi Prabhakar,

Thanks for the patch. I've got a few comments below.

This is directly from Wikipedia, isn't it?

What comes to the content, DPCM in the context of V4L2 media bus codes, as a
digital interface, is always digital. So there's no need to document it.
Entropy coding is also out of the question: the samples of the currently
defined formats are equal in size.

Another thing what I'm not sure is the definition of the simple and advanced
encoders. I've seen sensors that allow you to choose which one to use, but
the documentation hasn't stated what the actual implementation is. Does TI
documentation do so?

In V4L2 documentation we should state what is common in the hardware
documentation, and that is mostly limited to "simple" and "advanced". I
really don't know enough that I could say what the exact implamentation of
those two are in all of the cases.

I suggest we leave just a few words of the DPCM compression itself (roughly
the factual content of the first paragraph with the exception of the
reference to analogue signal) and a link to Wikipedia.

As the control's name is already "DPCM Predictor", I think you can drop
" Predictor" from the menu items.
