Hello everybody,

Following our (not so) long-standing tradition of V4L2 brainstorming meetings, 
I would like to propose Cambridge, UK as a possible location for the next 
brainstorming session on the first week of August (1st to 5th).

Linaro developers will gather for a one-week sprint session at the same time 
and place, and they will have a 3 half-day graphics summit where graphic 
memory management will be discussed (https://wiki.linaro.org/Events/2011-08-
LDS/Schedule). Collocating the V4L2 brainstorming meeting with the Linaro 
sprint would allow those of us who are interested in both topics to attend the 
Linaro graphics summit as well.

Topics to be discussed include pipeline configuration and per-frame 
configuration. Other topics can be proposed as well, but this should be enough 
to fill our usual 3 days agenda.

Before accepting the collocation request, Linaro needs an estimate of the 
number of attendees. We should limit ourselves to 6 to 8 people at most to 
keep the brainstorming sessions productive.

Could all people interested in attending a V4L2 brainstorming session on those 
dates notify me ASAP ?

Laurent Pinchart
