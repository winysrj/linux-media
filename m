Subject: [PATCH v9 0/5] ARM: sunxi: Add support for consumer infrared devices
Date: Mon,  9 Jun 2014 00:08:08 +0600
Message-Id: <1402250893-5412-1-git-send-email-bay@hackerdom.ru>

This patch introduces Consumer IR(CIR) support for sunxi boards.

This is based on Alexsey Shestacov's work based on the original driver 
supplied by Allwinner.
