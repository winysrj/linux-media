well, I kinda think we want something that exposes the "primary plane"
of the crtc.. I'm thinking something roughly like:

then use the existing GETPLANE ioctl to query the capabilities

I suppose you could try that.. typically that is in userspace,
however.  It seems like get_property would get messy quickly (ie. is
it a pitch alignment constraint, or stride alignment?  What if this is
different for different formats (in particular tiled)? etc)

Sure.. but userspace has more information readily available to make a
better choice.  For example, for omapdrm I'd do things differently
depending on whether I wanted to scan out that buffer (or a portion of
it) rotated.  This is something I know in the DDX driver, but not in
the kernel.  And it is quite likely something that is driver specific.
 Sure, we could add that to a generic "allocate me a buffer" ioctl.
But that doesn't really seem better, and it becomes a problem as soon
as we come across some hw that needs to know something different.  In
userspace, you have a lot more flexibility, since you don't really
need to commit to an API for life.

And to bring back the GStreamer argument (since that seems a fitting
example when you start talking about sharing buffers between many
devices, for example camera+codec+display), it would already be
negotiating format between v4l2src + fooencoder + displaysink.. the
pitch/stride is part of that format information.  If the display isn't
the one with the strictest requirements, we don't want the display
driver deciding what pitch to use.

yeah, dri2.. when the front buffer is allocated it is just a regular
pixmap.  If you swap/flip it becomes the back buffer and now shared
;-)
And pixmaps are allocated w/ enough frequency that it is the sort of
thing you might want to optimize.

And even when you know it will be shared, you don't know with who.

well, you need to consider separately what is (a) in the pages, and
(b) where the pages come from.

By moving the allocation into dmabuf you restrict (b).  For sharing
buffers, (a) may be restricted, but there is at least some examples of
hardware where (b) would not otherwise be restricted by sharing.

think carve-out created by bios.  In all the cases I am aware of, the
drm driver handles allocation of buffer(s) from the carveout.

I'm not sure if we have to fit everything in dma-mapping framework, at
least in cases where you have something that is specific to one
platform.

Currently dma-buf provides enough flexibility for other drivers to be
able to import these buffers.

s/does/can/

it doesn't always matter.  And in cases where it does matter, as long
as we can express the restrictions in dma_parms (which we can already
for the case of range-of-memory restrictions) we are covered

no, that doesn't really work

in this case, the format to any device (or userspace) accessing the
buffer is not tiled.  (Ie. it would look like normal NV12 or
whatever).  But there are some different requirements on stride.  And
there are cases where you would prefer not to use tiled buffers, but
the kernel doesn't know enough in the dumb-buffer alloc ioctl to make
the correct decision.

which is why you want to let userspace figure out the pitch and then
tell the display driver what size it wants, rather than using dumb
buffer ioctl ;-)

Ok, you could have a generic TELL_ME_WHAT_STRIDE_TO_USE ioctl or
property or what have you.. but I think that would be hard to get
right for all cases, and most people don't really care about that
because they already need a gpu/display specific xorg driver and/or
gl/egl talking to their kernel driver.  You are in a slightly special
case, since you are providing GL driver independently of the display
driver.  But I think that is easier to handle by just telling your
customers "here, fill out this function(s) to allocate buffer for
scanout" (and, well, I guess you'd need one to query for
pitch/stride), rather than trying to cram everything into the kernel.
