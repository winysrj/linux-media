OK, fair enough, let's discuss it, :-)

Yes, that is the motivation of the generic FD module. I think we can focus on
two use cases for the generic FD now:

- one is to detect faces from user space image data

- another one is to detect faces in image data generated from HW(SoC
internal bus, resize hardware)

For OMAP4 hardware, input data is always from physically continuous
memory directly, so it is very easy to support the two cases. For the
use case 2,
if buffer copy is to be avoided, we can use the coming shared dma-buf[1]
to pass the image buffer produced by other HW to FD hw directly.

For other FD hardware, if it supports to detect faces in image data from
physically continuous memory, I think the patch is OK to support it.

If the FD hw doesn't support to detect faces from physically continuous
memory, I have some questions: how does user space app to parse the
FD result if application can't get the input image data? If user space can
get image data, how does it connect the image data with FD result? and
what standard v4l2 ways(v4l2_buffer?) can the app use to describe the
image data?

I think user space will need the FD result, so it is very important to define
API to describe the FD result format to user space. And the input about your
FD HW result format is certainly helpful to define the API.

Without some hardware background, it is not easy to give a generic FD module
design.

For user space application, it doesn't make sense to handle FD results
only without image data.  Even though there are other ways of input
image data to FD, user space still need to know the image data, so it makes
sense to associate FD result with a memory buffer.

See the link[2], and my test result is basically consistent with the data.

Why is it a capture video node instead of OUTPUT v4l2 device? I think the
device name should be decided from the view of face detection function:
FD need input image data and produce detection result.

See the explanation above.
