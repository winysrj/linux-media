Ah... forgot to mention about that. I haven't included the fix for standard
setting, because either the stk1160 chip or the userspace application didn't
seem to behave properly: I got wrongly coloured frames when trying to
change the standard while streaming.

Can't your problem get fixed by setting an initial standard (e.g. at
/etc/motion configuration file)?

Not sure. If you're changing the standard while streaming then maybe some component
is not doing things right.

I can take a look at the std thing later, but for now the input
fix looks definitely correct.
