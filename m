I wonder if that's the best fix.

The queue_setup operation is supposed to return the size required by the 
driver for each plane. Depending on the hardware requirements, that size might 
not be a multiple of the page size.

As we can't mmap() a fraction of a page, the allocated plane size needs to be 
rounded up to the next page boundary to allow mmap() support. The dma-contig 
and dma-sg allocators already do so in their alloc operation, but the vmalloc 
allocator doesn't.

The recent "media: vb2: add length check for mmap" patch verifies that the 
mmap() size requested by userspace doesn't exceed the buffer size. As the 
mmap() size is rounded up to the next page boundary the check will fail for 
buffer sizes that are not multiple of the page size.

Your fix will not result in overallocation (as the allocator already rounds 
the size up), but will prevent the driver from importing a buffer large enough 
for the hardware but not rounded up to the page size.

A better fix might be to round up the buffer size in the buffer size check at 
mmap() time, and fix the vmalloc allocator to round up the size. That the 
allocator, not drivers, is responsible for buffer size alignment should be 
documented in videobuf2-core.h.
