I'm sure I wrote but not to the list as I was not
subscribed.

I found your e-mail (cam@mathematica.scientia.net) in
the dvb frequency files.

the mail was send at 13.11.2007 14:36 from  
Emanoil Kotsev <a9706152@unet.univie.ac.at>

you tell me what was wrong with this e-mail

I wrote also to the info@dvb-t.at, who provide
information about dvb-t in austria and they also did
not respond. I think the yshould have published this
information on their official site, so everybody could
use it ...

regards
