No problem.  It's a very common mistake.  And no, I'm not related to 
them.  For the record, I generally don't get concerned about the 
spelling of my name, unless the error causes problems (e.g. lost e-mail) 
or the error gets propagated to a large list where it might multiply...

Anyway, sorry also about taking this thread off topic.  Enough said...
