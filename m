Let me add one thing I forgot: the locking is using raw locks which are
not irq safe. It usually works. But. If the wait_lock is hold during
the unlock's slow path (that means there is no owner but the owner
field is not yet NULL) and the interrupt handler gets here with a
try_lock attempt then and it will spin forever on the wait_lock.

I will try to lookup the threads laterâ€¦
