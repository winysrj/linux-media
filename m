Ick, as this is breaking people's previously-working machines, shouldn't
this be resolved quickly?

Mauro said it broke the video drivers.  Mauro, if you wait 30 seconds,
does everything then "work"?

Not to say that waiting 30 seconds is a correct thing here...

module_init() can do lots of "bad" things, sleeping, asking for
firmware, and lots of other things.  To have userspace block because of
this doesn't seem very wise.

But previously this all "just worked" as we ran 'modprobe' in a new
thread/process right?  What's wrong with going back to just execing
modprobe and letting that process go off and do what ever it wants to
do?  It can't be that "expensive" as modprobe is a very slow thing, and
it should solve this issue.  udev will then have handled the 'a device
has shown up, run modprobe' event in the correct order, and then
anything else that the module_init() process wants to do, it can do
without worrying about stopping anything else in the system that might
want to happen at the same time (like load multiple modules in a row).

It's not a lockup, there have never been rules about what a driver could
and could not do in its module_init() function.  Sure, there are some
not-nice drivers out there, but don't halt the whole system just because
of them.

I recommend making module loading async, like it used to be, and then
all should be fine, right?

That's also the way the mdev works, and I don't think that people have
been having problems there. :)
