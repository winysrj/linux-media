input_dev fields need to be properly filled, but just duplicating the same
info on both structs and copying from one to the other doesn't seem the better
way. Why not just initialize rc_dev->input_dev fields directly, not duplicating
the data (or having a helper in-lined routine) to initialize those fields?

Ok, but the point is that a driver like ir-kbd-i2c (and other I2C drivers like
lirc-zilog - after ported to rc-core) will require several additional fields
that are added at rc_dev (basically, all fields that are, currently, at 
ir_dev_props structs may be needed by an i2c driver).

Duplicating dozens of fields is not a good idea.

It were added as optional, to avoid many changes at the drivers, as a way
to speedup drivers porting, but I think that all drivers should properly
initialize the fields there.

dvb-usb uses a large struct to device dvb devices, and, due to the
way it were done, every single field at RC should be inititialized,
per device. I don't like the way it is, but I didn't want to delay
the rc_core port on it, due to some discussions about how to re-structure
it to avoid the large amount of data duplication there. So, I just
added the absolute minimum fields there. IMO, we should do later 
a large cleanup on it. Yet, it is different than ir-kdb-i2c, since
since the beginning, the complete IR code is exported on DVB drivers,
while V4L drivers use to export just a few bits of the IR code (up
to seven bits). So, it is not a good example.

A good exercise would be to port lirc-zilog and see what happens.

One idea could be to initialize rc_dev at the caller drivers, passing
it via platform_data for the I2C drivers.

Also, instead of duplicating input_dev fields, directly initialize them 
inside the drivers, and not at rc-core.

I like the idea of having an inlined function (like usb_fill_control_urb),
to be sure that all mandatory fields are initialized by the drivers.

:)
