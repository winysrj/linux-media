Hi,

I just got 2 USB TV devices here that I would like to get just
analog TV support working for a start:

2040:7200 = Hauppauge WINTV HVR 950Q
0CCD:0072 = Terratec Cinergy hybrid T USB XS FM

I plugged both into a fedora 9 (2.6.25) box and neither were recognized.

Now in the just released 2.6.25 official kernel I notice only
support for the Hauppauge WINTV HVR 950 (2040:6513),
and 0CCD:0042 & 0CCD:0047 Terratec devices.

Note the difference between 950 and 950Q is that the 950 Q is QAM enabled
allowing the detection of digital channels over US cable systems while the
950 allows only terrestrial digital channel detection.

So do I just add the new device IDs and hope for the best?
Also I need to back port support to the fedora core 5 kernel (2.6.17),
so any gotchas you can think of doing that would be appreciated.

thanks,
PÃ¡draig.

p.s. I noticed the HVR 950 specific tree also didn't have support for these IDs:
