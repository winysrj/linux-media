Hi Julia

Thanks for the patch.

I don't think any data is freed by pxa_free_dma(), it only disables DMA on 
a certain channel. Theoretically there could be a different problem: 
pxa_free_dma() deactivates DMA, whereas pxa_dma_start_channels() activates 
it. But I think we're also protected against that: by the time 
pxa_camera_remove() is called, and operation on the interface has been 
stopped, client devices have been detached, pxa_camera_remove_device() has 
been called, which has also stopped the interface clock. And with clock 
stopped no interrupts can be generated. And the case of interrupt having 
been generated before clk_disabled() and only delivered to the driver so 
much later, that we're already unloading the module, seems really 
impossible to me. Robert, you agree?

OTOH, it would be nice to convert also this driver to managed allocations, 
which also would include devm_request(_threaded)_irq(), but that would 
mean, that free_irq() would be called even later than now, also after 
pxa_free_dma().

Speaking about managed allocations, those can be dangerous too: if you 
request an IRQ before, say, remapping memory, or if you only use managed 
IRQ requesting and ioremap() memory in your driver manually, that would be 
wrong. But from a quick grep looks like most (all?) drivers get ir right - 
first ioremap(), then request IRQ, but to be certain maybe coccinelle 
could run a test for that too;-)

Thanks
Guennadi
