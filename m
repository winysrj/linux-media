Yes, this might me a case of me getting the model incorrect again.
dma_buf_{begin,end}_cpu_access do not take a device structure and
from the comments:

/**
 * dma_buf_begin_cpu_access - Must be called before accessing a dma_buf from the
 * cpu in the kernel context. Calls begin_cpu_access to allow exporter-specific
 * preparations. Coherency is only guaranteed in the specified range for the
 * specified access direction.
 * @dmabuf:     [in]    buffer to prepare cpu access for.
 * @direction:  [in]    length of range for cpu access.
 *
 * Can return negative error values, returns 0 on success.
 */

If there are no buffer attachments, I guess the notion of 'coherency'
doesn't apply here so there is no need to do any kind of
syncing/mapping at all vs. trying to find a device out of nowhere.

I'll have to go back and re-think aligning sync/begin_cpu_access calls
and dma_buf_map calls, or more likely not overthink this.

I missed a patch in this series to remove that. If Ion is going to exist outside
of staging it should not be making that assumption at all so I want to drop it.
Any performance implications should be fixed with the skip sync flag.

Thanks,
