I assume you're talking about video_device::entity. To be exact, that field 
represents the entity in the media device graph associated with the V4L2 
device node, and isn't used for subdevice devnodes.

The usage of video_device to create subdevice devnodes leads to confusion in 
my opinion. I've initially proposed to split video_device into a v4l2_devnode 
and a video_device structure, but that was rejected.

The uvcvideo driver already has subdevs. It has no subdev devnodes though.

Some of our subdevs currently call to the bridge through board code. 
Configuring the OMAP3 ISP clocks is one such use case. This leads to complex 
dependencies and lots of race conditions.

Entities are not devices. I'm strongly opposed to that.

media_entity_get() is a hack. I would much rather see it die than being 
extended.

We should get rid of that. This would require disallowing all callbacks to the 
bridge through board code, but I'm not sure if that would be enough. Clocks 
could be handled using the clock framework, once it will be generic enough 
(this is being worked on). I'm not sure what other requirements we have (or 
might have in the future) that would make this difficult.

To (try to) answer the question we need a much better understanding of the 
current situation, including all dependencies between modules and detailed 
lifetime information of all actors involved (in response to open/close calls, 
module load/unload and device connect/disconnect events).
