Hello All,

We need to port dma fence and dma buf frame work to 3.10 kernel from
4.1 kernel. It seems a huge changes happened to  4.1 to 3.10. I am
trying to figure out difficulties before porting the same.

Can you please point out difficulties to port dma-fence and dma-buf to
3.10 kernel?

Thanks and regards,
Ayyappa.Ch
