I'll be at the ELC (as mentioned before) but it is highly unlikely I'll be
at LinuxCon. A LinuxCon is much more cloud/server/network oriented and much
less embedded systems/graphics/video oriented compared to an ELC or LPC.

I intend to skip LinuxCons in the future, unless there is some additional
reason above and beyond the conference itself for being there.

ELC is definitely the right place to do it as far as I am concerned.

I have booked the hotel, but not yet the flight. If the summit is
going to be next to as opposed to during the ELC, then I need to know
soon as I plan to book the flight early February.
