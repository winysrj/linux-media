This year was crazy... too much stuff on the 4Q. Only today I found some
time to merge all notes we took from the San Diego's summit, convert them
into html and publish.

They're all available at:
	http://www.linuxtv.org/news.php?entry=2012-12-28.mchehab

If you find anything wrong there, please ping me.

I intend to also release maybe today or tomorrow the notes from the 
Barcelona's workshop, and also store the presentations somewhere at
our site.

Regards,
Mauro
