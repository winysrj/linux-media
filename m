Hi again,

i managed to merge the driver with a media_build snapshot by hand, and managed to get it loaded
without errors. But now where I looked more closely to the files, I noticed something.

The driver refered mentions RTL2832u and some following versions, but it _dont_ mention RTL2831u
at all. Also the card I got contains the tuners mxl5005, mt2060 and qt1010, while this driver
contains files for mxl5007 and mt2063.

Teach me wrong, but it looks like the RTL2381u had been forgotten when this driver got made ;-)

Greeting,
Thomas
