I didn't say the commit is technically wrong. I simply meant that the
commit broke some of working systems (so some complain, I guess).

As I wrote, the related DMA API wasn't changed in 2.6.36-rc1. It's not
related with the regression at all. As long as nobody tries to extend
the API wrongly after rc2, I have no complaint.

btw, Marin Mitov said that these drivers don't need coherent memory,
they just want contiguous memory. Telling the page allocater to
reserve some memory at boot time is enough, I guess.
