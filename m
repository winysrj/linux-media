Hi Greg,

Thank you for the review.

In a nutshell, the race between device disconnection, which results in the 
device instance being delete (if not in use of course), and open() calls from 
userspace. The problem has been solved in V4L a couple of releases ago after 
suffering from this race for a too long time. As V4L devices (and now media 
devices) need to create both a struct device and a struct cdev instance, 
careful locking is needed.

Drivers depending on the media controller API will enable this, yes. The 
option will probably removed later when the API won't be deemed as 
experimental anymore.

Because I'm using a bitmap to store the used minor numbers, and I thus need a 
limit. I could get rid of it of it by using a linked list, but that will not 
be efficient (you could argue that the list will hold a few entries only most 
of the time, but in that case a limit of 256 minors wouldn't be a problem 
:-)).

It's not just camera. Media devices are... well, media devices. Basically 
anything that can handle audio and/or video streams. The media controller API 
can be used by plain audio devices.

Yes, one major and (for now) 256 minors. Is there a problem with it being 
dynamic ?

That will be done by the release callback. The media_devnode structure is 
embedded in the media_device structure, which will be embedded in driver-
specific structures.

This can happen when a USB device is disconnected for instance.

-ENXIO is probably better (I always confuse that with -ENODEV).

OK.

inode->i_cdev is set to NULL by cdev_default_release() which can be called 
from media_devnode_unregister(). I could move to container_of outside the 
lock, but in that case I would have to check for mdev == NULL || 
!mdev_devnode_is_registered(mdev) (or move the NULL check inside 
mdev_devnode_is_registered). Is that what you would like ?

That's correct. That way drivers don't need to care about unregister/open 
races, media_devnode will handle it for them.

> Then that's fine, but you can put the lock after the container_of(), right?

If I add a NULL check (as explained above), yes.

That will prevent the device instance from being freed until the device is 
closed, thereby holding both the device instance and the cdev instance in 
memory.

The cdev owner pointer is set to the fops owner. Unless I'm mistaken it will 
keep the module in memory. I need to keep the device in memory (or rather the 
media_devnode structure that embeds it) to handle file operations on a device 
that gets unregistered after it has been opened.

Because cdev already increments the owner refcount on open().

Sounds like a good idea. You're a better cdev expert than me, so could you 
give me a few pointers ? Do you want me to create a new object that will hold 
a struct cdev and a struct device together, or to embed the device structure 
into the existing cdev structure ?
