Hi Mauro,

Have you looked at the code for how the Conexant guys got the xc5000
firmware load to work (which uses 64 bytes at a time).  I suspect what
*really* needs to happen is that needs to be made generic so that the
stop bit is properly set (which would allow a single i2c transaction
to span across multiple USB control messages).

Note that the xc5000 hack is actually two changes merged together -
one uses a GPIO mode in certain cases to handle clock stretching
properly (which probably has to stay there for now), and the other
allows for larger i2c transactions.  I am referring to the latter
change.

If we fix the cx231xx i2c master, then we can go back to the original
18271 config, which avoids the risk of regression for other devices.

Adding mkrufky to the CC: on this, since he is the 18271 maintainer.

Devin
