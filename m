Ok, I will configure that.

Oh, I'm sorry, I don't have any idea to explicit more details. I will
find something for that.

I have executed this script before to send it. And it noticed nothing about that.

Maybe I'm in the wrong list for that in fact. I didn't know this list was about V4L2 and related topics.
This driver is only to configure the component to manage the video stream in electronic card, it is not to capture video stream via V4L.

I should improve my driver to be configurable by userspace. But maybe I should submit my future patch in another ML. 

Thanks for all.

Charles-Antoine
