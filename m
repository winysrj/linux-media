Hi all,


is there any news or progress with the work for Hauppauge WinTV-HVR 900H 
under Linux?

I read in March some emails here about this theme and I was very happy 
with it, because I have one of these cards. But suddenly there were no 
more news about it. I am still reading the linux-media mail list summary 
every day, but there are no more news.

I can help testing, but only the digital section, cause here where I 
live the analogic TV is already disabled.

Please.. any ray of hope? :)


Thanks
