That's the problem. You can say thanks to Conexant (NXP, Philips ?). 
Technisat is trying hard (and the LinuxTV people as well) to convince the 
people involved...., without success so far.

No, my relation is not so tight. I'm just an individual is writing some 
Linux-drivers for things I want to use.

No, not at all. On the contrary I heard that the support of Technisat was 
not really aware ( 3 weeks ago ), that they are going to release the 
linux-driver this time.

I'm sorry to hear that, but in that case maybe you need to switch your 
supplier.

Patrick.
