Well, it's a pretty small stuff and ac97 isn't developed so much any
longer, so I'm fine to put your code in the video tree.

Looking through your patch, a remaining problem is that the dependency
on the sound core is missing.  The "select" in Kconfig doesn't fulfill
the dependencies automatically but forcibly sets the value. 

Selecting CONFIG_SND_AC97_CODEC will select most of other components
but CONFIG_SND itself must be enabled beforehand.  Thus, you need to
wrap CONFIG_VIDEO_STK1160 with "depends on SND".
Or split the ac97 codec part and makes it depending on SND, and
define dummy functions if not defined, e.g.

#ifdef CONFIG_VIDEO_STK1160_AC97
int stk1160_ac97_register(struct stk1160 *dev);
int stk1160_ac97_unregister(struct stk1160 *dev);
#else
static inline int stk1160_ac97_register(struct stk1160 *dev) { return 0; }
static inline int stk1160_ac97_unregister(struct stk1160 *dev) { return 0; }
#endif


thanks,

Takashi
