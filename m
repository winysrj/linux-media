Yes, that's all I care about in staging, but as I stated, I don't
maintain drivers/staging/media/ that area is under Mauro's control
(MAINTAINERS even says this), and I'm a bit leery of going against the
wishes of an existing subsystem maintainer for adding staging drivers
that tie into their subsystem.

So if you get Mauro's approval, I'll be glad to queue it up.
