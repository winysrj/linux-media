Depending on isoc_mode module parameter, the device uses different image 
formats: YUV 4:2:2 interleaved, YUV 4:2:0 planar or compressed format.

Maybe the parameter should go away and these three formats exposed to 
userspace? Hopefully the non-compressed formats could be used directly 
without any conversion. But the compressed format (with new V4L2_PIX_FMT_ 
assigned?) should be preferred (as it provides much higher frame rates). The 
code moved into libv4lconvert would decompress the format and convert into 
something standard (YUV420?).

I can try it. But the hardware isn't mine so my time is limited.

GREY, RGB24 and RGB32 seem to work (at least with mplayer). RGB565 and RGB555 
have wrong colors. GREY is implemented only in compressed mode but can be 
selected in other modes too. Can't userspace do the conversion better?
