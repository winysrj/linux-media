Subject: [PATCH 1/2] i2c: Add generic support passing secondary devices addresses
Date: Wed, 22 Oct 2014 17:30:47 +0200
Message-Id: <1413991848-28495-1-git-send-email-jean-michel.hautbois@vodalys.com>
Sender: linux-media-owner@vger.kernel.org
List-ID: <linux-media.vger.kernel.org>

Some I2C devices have multiple addresses assigned, for example each address
corresponding to a different internal register map page of the device.
So far drivers which need support for this have handled this with a driver
specific and non-generic implementation, e.g. passing the additional address
via platform data.

This patch provides a new helper function called i2c_new_secondary_device()
which is intended to provide a generic way to get the secondary address
as well as instantiate a struct i2c_client for the secondary address.

The function expects a pointer to the primary i2c_client, a name
for the secondary address and an optional default address. The name is used
as a handle to specify which secondary address to get.

The default address is used as a fallback in case no secondary address
was explicitly specified. In case no secondary address and no default
address were specified the function returns NULL.

For now the function only supports look-up of the secondary address
from devicetree, but it can be extended in the future
to for example support board files and/or ACPI.
