Guennadi,

I don't have the schematics of those cameras, but I suspect that the
clock for the sensor is hardwired, e. g. probably em28xx can't enable
or disable it. This is the usual solution on non-embedded hardware.

That's why, IMHO, putting anything at the USB bridge driver (em28xx)
makes no sense: the bridge doesn't have any control over the clock.

I don't think that (b) is wrong: it is not a matter or clocks being
compulsory or not. It is a matter of being able to be controlled or not.

If the clock can't be controlled via software, there's no sense on adding
control stuff for it: it will just add extra code for no good reason.

I prefer to have some solution that won't add any extra code if the
clock is always on and can't be controlled.
