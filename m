Mauro, stop blathering.

The problem is that the tool used to work with OLD DEVICES AND SETUPS
that used to work. That broke. It needs to get fixed.

We do not change user-land ABI. Not now, not ever. And no, "the tool
is broken" is NOT an excuse. Bringing it up as one is unacceptable.
The fact that there are devices that didn't use to be supported at all
that don't work with the old tool has absolutely ZERO relevance,
because that's not a regression.

No regressions. No excuses. No "user-land is broken", however much you
disagree with it.
