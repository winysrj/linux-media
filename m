Hi Alex

Why is the cc-list mangled again? Why is the V4L list dropped again? 
What's so difficult about hitting the "reply-to-all" button?

First of all it shows, that you're not using the newest kernel:

http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.linux.ports.sh.devel/11508

Secondly, as Fabio just pointed out, these messages are not fatal, which 
is also the reason, why I changed their priority to "debug"

Please, describe the actual problem, that you're getting (if any) and do 
add the v4l list back to the list of recipients!

Thanks
Guennadi
