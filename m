  Thanks for the pointer that looks good. I've also found
drivers/media/platform/mem2mem_testdev.c which seems to do even more
testing of the area I made changes to. So now I have to find some userspace
tool which can issue proper ioctls to setup and use the buffers and I can
start testing what I wrote :)
