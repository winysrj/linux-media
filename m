OK.

We all have some sort of different CodingStyle that were inherited from previous
programming practices... I used to just not add any space at all at expressions, 
as C is a compact language, and I was a bit lazy ;)

Yet, when reviewing lots of code, those spaces help to read a code quicker
than without. Not sure why, but my guess is that the brain can do a faster
parsing when the words are separated from operators. Or maybe it is just because
it is easier to parse patches when everybody uses the same Coding Style.

Very true ;)
