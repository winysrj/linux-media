Is there a possibility someone will take care of analogue support on
WinFast PxDVR 3200 H? If yes, I can test it, send debug outputs, be a beta
tester, just say.
I can even help with development, I have a litle bit experience with kernel
module programming. So if someone gives me a clue I can do little
modifications myself (changing some values to see which one is the right
one, ... maybe more).

Regards,
Martin
