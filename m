The call point (enable_signaling) only needs to know whether its own counter has passed or not. This prevents the race where the counter
has elapsed, but the irq was not yet enabled.

I don't really care if enable_signaling updates last_seq or not, it only needs to check if it's own fence has been signaled after enabling sw_irqs.

Additional to that we need allot of special handling in case of a hardware lockup here, which isn't done if you abuse the fence interface like this.
I think it's not needed to leave the irq enabled, it's a leftover from when I was debugging the mac and no interrupt occurred at all.

> Also your approach of leaking the IRQ context outside of the driver is a very bad idea from the conceptual side. Please don't modify the fence interface at all and instead use the wait functions already exposed by radeon_fence.c. If you need some kind of signaling mechanism then wait inside a workqueue instead.
The fence takes up the role of a single shot workqueue here. Manually resetting the counter and calling wake_up_all would end up waking all active fences, there's no special handling needed inside radeon for this.
The fence api does provide a synchronous wait function, but this causes a stall of whomever waits on it. When I was testing this with intel I used the fence callback to poke a register in i915, this allowed it to not block until it hits the wait op in the command stream, and even then only if the callback was not called first.

It's documented that the callbacks can be called from any context and will be called with irqs disabled, so nothing scary should be done. The kernel provides enough debug mechanisms to find any violators.
PROVE_LOCKING and DEBUG_ATOMIC_SLEEP for example.
