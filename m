Why do you even do that? The copying here I mean - why don't you just
directly scan out from the grant references you received through the
hypervisor?

Also I'm not clear in your example which step happens where (guest 1/2
or hypervisor)?

So this is entirely a means to implement the virtual xen device in
dom0 (or whichever guest implements it)?

I'm externally confused about what you mean with "backend", since
xen-front also has backend code. But that backend code lives in the
same guest os image (afaict at least), since it does direct function
calls.

Please be more specific in what you mean instead of just "backend",
that's really confusing.

But essentially we're talking about the equivalent of what qemu does
for kvm, and that's entirely not my problem. Not really a gpu
subsystem problem I think. Just talk with the xen hypervisor people
about how exactly they want to go about converting grant tables to
dma-buf, so that your virtual hw backend in userspace can make use of
it. And then merge it somewhere in the xen directories. Since the
grant tables and everything is very xen specific, I don't think
there's much point in trying to have a fake generic uapi that pretends
to work on other hypervisors, as long as they're Xen :-)

And you probably have no need for all the caching/general book-keeping
drm_prime does (it's all in userspace I guess, except for the magic
conversion from grant references to a dma_buf). So there's no point
trying to reuse code in drm_prime.c.

Also, this should make it tons easier to reuse xen-zcopy for
sound/wireless/v4l backends.

Ok, that explains. I thought your current xen-side implementation for
xen-front is already making all that stuff happen. But I'm still not
sure given all the confusing talk about back-end we have in these
threads (hyperdmabuf people also talked about different backends for
different hypervisors, I guess that's a different kind of backend?).
