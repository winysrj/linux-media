Stop sending SPAM to this list.

What should be the "intentions"?

What should happen? Please reiterate all details!

Intentions of chip manufacturers are simple, sell more and make more
profit than others for others.

Further questions on that?

On what do _you_ have any progress and can contribute?

Is it at least any better on m$?

For sure not!

There is no "as well".

Please provide at least one _single_ patch,
showing you have any direction on that ...

What ever happened? Nothing new.

Please try it also from that side then ...

IIRC, XCeive supposed a market, for tuners alone, above 6 billions for
the next year as a starting argument for investors.

Buy whatever you want.

As long, those acting on the markets, even without any freely agreeable
convention for measurements as reference, how can we have any?

Tell from which _instance_  "punishing points" are allowed and why ...

Since it is such a mass/global market, looking promising, lots jump in,
but often are out again only a little later. Ever looked in details?

To have no proper signal/SNR measurement agreement across all products
is only a side effect, but for sure not related to Open Source ;)

Show me a treaty, _all_ involved parties did sign, and then _eventually_
some prediction on that in some next future for outdated hardware is
feasible.
