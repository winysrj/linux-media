Using subdir-ccflags-y has one drawback you need to be aware of.
The variable is _not_ picked up if you build individual drivers like
this:


     make drivers/media/dvb/b2c2/

So with this patch applied it is no longer possible to do so.
It is better to accept the duplication rather than breaking
the build of individual drivers.

This is the right approach.

You could consider to do a more general cleanup:
1) replace EXTRA_CFLAGS with ccflags-y (the one you suggest)
2) replace use of <module>-objs with <module>-y
3) break continued lines into several assignments
   People very often uses '\' to break long lines, where a
   simple += would be much more readable.
   But this topic may be personal - I never uses "\" in my .c code unless in macros,
   and I have applied the same rule for Makefiles.
   An ugly example is drivers/media/Makefile
4) In general use ":=" instead of "=".
   Add using "+=" as first assignment is OK - but it just looks plain wrong
5) some files has a mixture of spaces/tabs (are red in my vim)
   dvb-core/Makefile is one such example
6) remove useless stuff
   siano/Makefile has some strange assignments to EXTRA_CFLAGS
7) Likely a few more items to look after...

This is more work - but then you finish a Makefile rather than doing a simple
conversion.
