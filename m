I would like to give a short presentation on / demo off the usb redirection
over the network (USB-IP replacement with a less dumb protocol) I've been
working on, followed by a questions and answers session.

For those who want to give this a try now, see:

I'm not really happy with how the management / hand over of userspace
to kernel space drivers and vice versa works. This is a problem when
doing usb-redirection to a virtual machine. I think this is best discussed
in a separate thread, and then if needed further discussed during the
mini summit. I'll send a mail on this shortly. I'll use the same address
list as this mail, except that I'm going to cut linux-kernel from the CC list.

Interesting, being able to tell the core how much bandwidth a device
will actually use (versus what it claims as maxpacketsize in its
descriptors) is something which we really need. I know of at least
2 usb1 webcam chipsets (and drivers) which have only 1 altsetting which
claim 1023 bytes maxpacketsize. But they also have a register which
allows the driver to configure how large the largest (iso) packet it
sends will actually be.

Currently these drivers have this "beauty" to be able to tell the
linux usb core that they won't be using 1023 as maxpacketsize but
something else, and thus function without needing full usb1 bandwidth:

struct usb_host_interface *alt;
alt = &gspca_dev->dev->config->intf_cache[0]->altsetting[1];
alt->endpoint[0].desc.wMaxPacketSize = cpu_to_le16(packet_size);
ret = usb_set_interface(gspca_dev->dev, gspca_dev->iface, 1);

Yes they are overwriting the kernels cached descriptors ...

###

Something which I would also like to bring to everyone's attention
is that we really need to fix the ehci schedule code wrt scheduling
usb1 transfers over usb2 hubs.

The current code is very broken when it comes to periodic transfers,
it basically disallows using the last microframe (let alone the
crossing of the frame boundary and using the first microframe of
the next frame).

This means that trying to submit isoc transfers with a size of 1023
will just plain fail, even if this is the only device on the entire
bus. This is one of the reasons I ended up doing the hack above, so
that these devices will at least work (be it at a decreased framerate)
through a usb2 hub.

Things become even messier when the device has a build in usb audio
microphone, often this will just not work.

Finally fixing this has become more important now then ever since
sandybridge machines (and maybe generation one core i# machines too,
I don't know) no longer have a companion controller, but instead
have an integrated usb2 hub.

Regards,

Hans
