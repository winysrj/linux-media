Mauro,

As this _stable_ patch series is developed originally
(and already submitted for review) since 2013,
not based on Tsukada's patch you just linked,
it is difficult to split into one patch per logic.

As you said, for example, to fix the Tsukada's patch of tuner - FE - bridge
communication, we need to fix all the files.

We started developing and publishing PT3 drivers (chardev and DVB versions)
on 2013 and have been submitting the patches to this community since then.
We were waiting for reviews.

However this July, a man named Tsukada, who has been annoying us since
the beginning of development (we invited him to merge/join the project,
in other words, opted him to be co-author), interrupted our submission
and started
speaking ill of us that we didn't want to split the driver and stopped
the development, etc.
This is not true. What we meant was that, it is too early to implement
Regmap I2C
for now (except if it is a firm consensus, surely we will do).

Unfortunately, you trusted him and put on the tree. If "backstabbing"
is permitted,
this will be a very bad precedence in our community.

We can send per logic patches without breaking the compilation,
but we cannot guarantee the behaviour if you apply only one patch or two.
Thus, pulling the clean package from

       https://github.com/knight-rider/ptx/tree/master/pt3_dvb

is the best bet. Or, do you have the card with you?

Best Regards
-Bud
