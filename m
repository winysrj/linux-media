Hi Krzysztof, I've been on vacation, just returned today. I will
find the time this week to attempt to reproduce your results on
a SabreAuto quad with the adv7180.

Btw, if you just need to capture an interlaced frame (lines 0,1,2,...)
without motion compensation, there is no need to use the VDIC
path. Capturing directly from ipu2_csi1 should work, I've tested
this many times on a SabreAuto. But I will try to reproduce your
results.

Steve
