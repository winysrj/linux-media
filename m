 Mark,

Don't worry about opening the shielded area, I have opened mine enough to
read the details on the chip, but not enough to take a photo easily.

The chip in it is exactly the same as my DViCO Dual Express, with the
same components around it, so the settings I have used for that should
work with this one.

Regards,

Stephen.

Hi Jon,

I just added some photos to the wiki that I took of my 3200 about a=20
month ago, it's just some close ups of the chips.  I forgot all about=20
them until you posted this message, figured I should probably pull my=20
finger out and upload them.

I haven't taken the shielding off the card, I can only assume there=20
is a tuner in there, I will crack it open on of these days and take=20
note (and photos) of what is inside.

Mark
