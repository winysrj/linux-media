I was talking about endpoints, not ports. There's no unclarity about the
number of ports, that comes directly from the hardware for that specific
component. The number of endpoints, however, come from the board
hardware. The driver writer cannot know that.

It considerably lessens the amount of text in the DT for many use cases,
making it easier to write and maintain the dts files.

Well, yes, I agree there. This is not the simplest of bindings. I'd be
more than happy if we would come up with simpler version of this, which
would still allow us to have the same descriptive power.

If we forget the shortened endpoint format, I think it can be quite
specific.

A device has either one port, in which case it should require the
'ports' node to be omitted, or the device has more than one port, in
which case it should require 'ports' node.

Note that the original v4l2 binding doc says that 'ports' is always
optional.
