I could never get DiBcom 7000PC to work properly, there is something not
right with the AGC settings. I needed an attenuator on Mendip UK before
the transmitters power increased, now I can't get it work at all.

Legacy applications/utils tested so far with 3.2/next on DVB-T on other
adapters.

scan		okay	use -5 option increases time out helps
w_scan		okay	use -F option increases time out helps
dvbscan 	fail	Unable to query frontend status

me-tv		okay
kaffeine	okay
VLC		okay
mplayer	dvb://	okay
VDR		okay
mumudvb		okay
zap		okay
