I agree. compaction and movable zone will be one of good solutions.

If some driver needs big contiguous chunk to work, it should make sure
to be allowable to have memory size for it before going. To make sure
it, we have to consider compaction of ZONE_MOVABLE zone. But one of
problems is anonymous page which can be has a role of pinned page in
non-swapsystem. Even most of embedded system has no swap.
But it's not hard to solve it.

We needs Mel's opinion, too.
