Hi Mauro.

I'm going to stick my head above the parapet as one of the original 
authors back when I worked at Broadcom.
As it happens I started working at Raspberry Pi last Monday, so that 
puts me in a place where I can work on this again a bit more. (The last 
two years have been just a spare time support role).
Whilst I have done kernel development work in various roles, it's all 
been downstream so I've not been that active on these lists before.

All formatting/checkpatch comments noted.
Checkpatch was whinging when this was first written around December 2013 
about long lines, so many got broken up to shut it up. Views on code 
style and checkpatch seem to have changed a little since then.
I thought we had made checkpatch happy before the driver was pushed, but 
with some of the comments still having // style I guess some slipped 
through the net.
Yes chunks of this could do with refactoring to reduce the levels of 
indentation - always more to do.
If I've removed any formatting/style type comments in my cuts it's not 
because I'm ignoring them, just that they're not something that needs 
discussion (just fixing). I've only taken out the really big lumps of 
code with no comments on.

Newbie question: if this has already been merged to staging, where am I 
looking for the relevant tree to add patches on top of? 
git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/gregkh/staging.git branch 
staging-next?

Responses to the rest inline.
TL;DR answer is that you are seeing the top edge of a full ISP 
processing pipe and optional encoders running on the GPU, mainly as 
there are blocks that can't be exposed for IP reasons (Raspberry Pi only 
being the customer not silicon vendor constrains what can and can't be 
made public).
That doesn't seem to fit very well into V4L2 which expects that it can 
see all the detail, so there are a few nasty spots to shoe-horn it in. 
If there are better ways to solve the problems, then I'm open to them.

Thanks
   Dave

Is that even likely given the dependence on VCHI? I wasn't expecting 
VCHI to leave staging, which would force this to remain too.

This is sitting on top of an OpenMaxIL style camera component (though 
accessed via MMAL - long story, but basically MMAL removed a bundle of 
the ugly/annoying parts of IL).
It has the extension above V1.1.2 that you have a preview port, video 
capture port, and stills capture port. Stills captures have additional 
processing stages to improve image quality, whilst video has to maintain 
framerate.

If you're asked for YUV or RGB frame, how do you choose between video or 
stills? That's what is being set with these parameters, not the sensor 
resolution. Having independent stills and video processing options 
doesn't appear to be something that is supported in V4L2, but I'm open 
to suggestions.
There were thoughts that they could be exposed as different /dev/videoN 
devices, but that then poses a quandry to the client app as to which 
node to open, so complicates the client significantly. On the plus side 
it would then allow for things like zero shutter lag captures, and 
stills during video, where you want multiple streams (apparently) 
simultaneously, but is that worth the complexity? The general view was no.

I will double check on Monday. The main Raspberry Pi distribution is 
based on Debian, so packages can be quite out of date. This bug 
certainly affected Wheezy, but I don't know for certain about Jessie. 
Sid still hasn't been adopted.

Also be aware that exactly the same issue of not supporting 
V4L2_FRMSIZE_TYPE_STEPWISE affects Chromium for WebRTC, and they seem 
not to be too bothered about fixing it - 
https://bugs.chromium.org/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=249953
Now admittedly it's not the kernel's responsibility to work around 
application issues, but if it hobbles a board then that is an issue.

Not in this case.
You're at the end of a full ISP processing pipe, and there is the option 
for including either JPEG, MJPEG, or H264 encoding on the end. It is 
supported to ask the camera component which formats it supports, but 
you'll still need a conversion table from those MMAL types to V4L2 
enums, and options for adding the encoded formats.

What's the processing latency through the ISP and optional 
H264/MJPG/JPEG encode to get to this point? Typically you're looking at 
30-80ms depending on exposure time and various other factors, which 
would be enough to put A/V sync out if not compensated for.

The GPU side is timestamping all buffers with the CSI frame start 
interrupt timestamp, but based on the GPU STC. There is a MMAL call to 
read the GPU STC which is made at streamon (stored in 
dev->capture.vc_start_timestamp), and therefore this is taking a delta 
from there to get a more accurate timestamp.
(An improvement would be to reread it every N seconds to ensure there 
was no drift, but the Linux kernel tick is actually off the same clock, 
so it is only clock corrections that would introduce a drift).
As I understand it UVC is doing a similar thing, although it is trying 
to compensate for clock drift too.

Now one could argue that ideally you want the timestamp for the start of 
exposure, but there is no event outside of the sensor to trigger that. 
You could compute it, but the exposure time control loop is running on 
the GPU so the kernel doesn't know the exposure time. It's also a bit of 
a funny thing anyway when dealing with rolling shutter sensors and 
therefore considering which line you want the start of exposure for.

No, this is working around the fact that very few clients respect 
bytesperline (eg QV4L2 and libv4lconvert for many of the formats).

The ISP needs to be writing to buffers with the stride being a multiple 
of 32, and height a multiple of 16 (and that includes between planes of 
YUV420). V4L2 appears not to allow that, therefore there is then a 
second operation run in-place on the buffer to remove that padding, but 
the buffer needs to be sized sufficiently to handle the padded image first.
I had a conversation with Hans back in 2013 with regard this, and there 
wasn't a good solution proposed. It could potentially be specified using 
the cropping API, but that pushes the responsibility back onto every 
client app to drive things in a very specific manner. If they don't 
respect bytesperline they are even less likely to handle cropping.
You could restrict the resolution to being a multiple of 32 on the width 
and 16 on the height, but in doing so you're not exposing the full 
capabilities.

I'm open to suggestions as to how V4L2 can do this without just beating 
up client apps who do the wrong thing.

Multiplanar formats seem not to be an option as the ISP is expecting one 
contiguous buffer to be provided to take all the planes, but the 
multiplanar stuff supplies multiple independent buffers. Again please 
correct me if I'm wrong on that.

As noted above, what do you consider a still when dealing with raw RGB

Isn't this frame interval, not resolution, although yes, it ought to 
sanity check the resolution to be a multiple of 2 in each direction.

With regard frame interval, it could be specified as STEPWISE with an 
increment of 32.5usecs or 18.9usecs (the default line time for ov5647 
and imx219 respectively), but to most people that would count as continuous.

There is the added complication that the GPU code will select the most 
appropriate sensor mode (about 7 are defined) based on the frame rate 
and resolution requested, and each of the modes has different line 
times. Reading it back would be possible but just seemed excessive.


I'm curious now, how does analogue TV count as CONTINUOUS when surely it 
isn't something that can be set on a tuner that is only relaying the 
received video signal.

More that this query wasn't available on early GPU firmware versions - 
it was added in 2016 when the IMX219 camera support was added.
If there are genuinely no cameras connected, then the camera component

Memory usage.
Video mode runs as an optimised pipeline so requires multiple frame buffers.
Stills mode typically has to stop the sensor, reprogram for full res 
mode, stream for one frame, and then stops the sensor again, therefore 
only one stills res buffer is required.
If you've specified video mode to run at more than 1080P, then the GPU 
needs to be told up front so that it can allocate the extra memory.

Video vs stills port.
TBH I'd actually want to double check whether this is necessary as I 
thought it went through the standard s_fmt path to set up the default 
mode, and that would do all this anyway.

You're at the end of the ISP. Everything except flips, exposure time and 
analogue gain are implemented in the ISP so therefore they are supported.
All sensors are expected to support flips, exposure time and analogue 
gain correctly (otherwise I complain to whoever wrote the camera driver!).

I'd need to check exactly what the situation is here. It's been a while 
since I've looked at the buffer handling code, but will review and make 
it a BUG_ON if appropriate.
