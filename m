As you wish. I reverted that.

Right.

All right. I'm waiting for the second review to post both patches
amended. Meanwhile, I'll always keep the 2 patches state here :
http://belgarath.falguerolles.org/download/for_guennadi/

This is the place where the 2 patches are, in their newest form (the merged
version from you and me). I took the liberty to cosign the patches, up to you to
remove either mine, or yours, or rewrite a part of the patch, to your will.

Cheers.
