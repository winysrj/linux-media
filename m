No reason at all besides that intel-gtt is using scatterlist internally
(and only kludges the sg_table together in an ad-hoc fashion) and so I
haven't noticed. sg_table for more consistency with the dma api sounds
good.

Imo fds are nice because their known and there's already all the
preexisting infrastructure for them around. And if we ever get fancy with
e.g. sync objects we can easily add poll support (or some insane ioctls).
But I agree that "we can mmap" is bust as a reason and should just die.
