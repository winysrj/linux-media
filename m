I care not for a windows port, it's of no interest to me. I'm sure
NetUp Windows customers will find it useful.

I was simply stating my opinion, it not a list of points I wish to
debate with you or anyone else. Please don't take this comment
personally. You are welcome to your own opinion and draw your own
conclusions on how I feel about the matter.

Yes, I could, thanks to github.

I think I respectfully disagree with you.
