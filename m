Sounds all good.

I think the future of iovmm is looking not so good. Marek Szyprowski
is working on a generic version of the dma-mapping API (dma_map_ops)
based on the iommu API. As far as I can tell, once we have that in
place, we you can migrate omap3isp from iovmm to dma-mapping and
remove iovmm.

Of course if there are things missing from the dma-mapping API
that are present in iovmm, we should know about them so that we can
extend the dma-mapping API accordingly.

ok.

Yes, very good idea.
