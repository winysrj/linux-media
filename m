Do you have a better suggestion where it should move to?

drivers/gpu/drm - no, because v4l2 wants to use it
drivers/media/video - no, because DRM drivers want to use it
drivers/video - no, because v4l2 and drm drivers want to use it

Maybe drivers/of-graph/ ?  Or maybe it's just as good a place to move it
into drivers/of ?
