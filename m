Hauppauge have the lion's share of the DVB card market so this mod
should have been tested with a Haupauge RC, but clearly wasn't.  It also
clearly wasn't tested with a cx2388x card because the interrupt handler
has an obvious overflow.

It is correct for 2.6.38, which is what was described.  I haven't
checked all the keymaps but a sample of 5 show that none include a
system ID.

So, cherrypick the Hauppauge keytable from 2.6.39 and apply it to 2.6.38
together with the 2nd part of this patch.  It would be real nice if that
was in 2.6.38.3
