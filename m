No.

Andy, I fully understand how this stuff works.
You apparently don't (yet).

Look at include/linux/printk.h

#ifndef pr_fmt
#define pr_fmt(fmt) fmt
#endif

A default empty define is used when one
is not specified before printk.h is
included.  kernel.h includes printk.h

v4l2_<level> uses the "name" of the video
device in its output.  That name may not
be the same name as the module.
