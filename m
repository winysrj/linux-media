Why can't you revert a commit that causes the regression?

The related DMA API wasn't changed in 2.6.36-rc1. The DMA API is not
responsible for the regression. And the patchset even exnteds the
definition of the DMA API (dma_declare_coherent_memory). Such change
shouldn't applied after rc1. I think that DMA-API.txt says that
dma_declare_coherent_memory() handles coherent memory for a particular
device. It's not for the API that reserves coherent memory that can be
used for any device for a single device.
