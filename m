No, input_register_device() and input core itself does not have symbol
dependency on evdev (which provides /dev/input/eventX), which is just an
input handler. A very important, but still an optional, handler.

That's what I have been saying in the last 3+ emails, yes.

The problem I have with it is that it violates layering. You affect
different subsystems/layers, why do you insist on jamming them togetehr?
Don't do the kitchen sink style, pretty please.

So? Keep it there, it does not hurt anything.

You can't calculate this automatically given the length of the
"scancode"? I mean if you have keymap file with

0x12345678936 KEY_COFFEE

that means that scancode is at least 36 bit.

or write a script to convert and be done with it?

gpm is different and more akin to X itself and is not limited to mice;
jstest uses differnt interface (jsX, not eventX) so you are right, we
should not mix them into utilities working with event interface.

keymap/ir-keytable both work with event interface.
