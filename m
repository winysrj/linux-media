That is all OK so far.

But it is not about sensibilities, but usability in the first place.

I give an example in short.

http://linuxtv.org/wiki/index.php/DVB-T_PCI_Cards

This starts with some ASUS My Cinema P7131-Dual model and the photos are
taken from there. But that user had a P7131 Hybrid and he was the only
one ever reporting problems like this,

DVB, VDR, (***unstable*** causes random memory corruption and crashes),

but stays on top of all recent PCI cards with hybrid tuners and speaks
for all Asus saa713x ...

This should be meanwhile eight different cards including the not yet
externally documented Asus Tiger 3in1 I guess.

It of cause continues here.
http://linuxtv.org/wiki/index.php/ASUS_My_Cinema-P7131_Hybrid

Almost all is wrong or at least not differentiated enough.

If you look at the bttv-gallery for the related cards,
there is at least _nothing_ wrong.

Cheers,
Hermann
