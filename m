Hello,

I think to use dt3155 as a reference for new pci express driver ,
becuase it is highly simple as a starting point, and contains only
single file :)
The driver I'll develop will eventually be used for multiple video
capture and single video output.

I just wanted to ask if you recommend it as a starting point.

Best Regards,
Ran
