Hi all,

Currently v4l-utils is at version 0.7.91, which as the version
suggests is meant as a beta release.

As this release seems to be working well I would like to do
a v4l-utils-0.8.0 release soon. This is a headsup, to give
people a chance to notify me of any bugs they would like to
see fixed first / any patches they would like to add first.

Regards,

Hans
