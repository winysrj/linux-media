I think I was doing something wrong when creating these patches. i.g.
I just hightlight the code then move the cursor highlight all the way to 
the right before pressing "x". normally would be o.k. but for some 
reason seems to be doing this. found if I highlight left to ; (or the 
end of the code I want to delete) then git commit creates the patch 
properly.
