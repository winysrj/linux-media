I agree. In case anybody wants to use this for audio in the future,
media already sounds more generic than video.

The get_remote_port(_parent) are fine, I think.

Yes, I'd already have a use-case for that in enumerating the
encoders/panels connected to a single display interface (port).

On the other hand if you just want to enumerate components from the
device tree, iterating over all endpoints of all ports is useful, too.

Also, I'd like to drop the prev reference in get_next_endpoint, then a
for_each_endpoint macro could be made from that.
