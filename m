Hi,

I sent a message yesterday (bellow) asking about a capture
card with 
composite video, SVideo and Firewire and supported by
video4linux and got no answer... I made a lot of research
and until now i could not find such a device... The priority
is capture DV Camcorders (by firewire input) and also
capture composite video devices...

As there are several reported incompatibility issues about
missing drivers and related bugs for many cards i'm really
looking for advices about a known working device. It would
be realy usefull to me. I'm using ubuntu 8.04 distribution.

Thank you!
Daniel
