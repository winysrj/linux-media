I guess we failed to clearly describe the 'field-even-active' property then.
It seems to be exactly what you need.

It is not enough to say e.g. field-active = <1>;, because it would not have
been clear which field it refers to, odd or even ? Unlike VSYNC, HSYNC both
levels of the FIELD signal are "active", there is no "idle" state for FIELD.

So field-even-active = <1>; means the FIELD signal at logic high level
indicates EVEN field _and_ this implies FIELD = 0 indicates ODD field, i.e.

FIELD = 0 => odd field
FIELD = 1 => even field

For field-even-active = <0>; it is the other way around:

FIELD = 0 => even field
FIELD = 1 => odd field

It looks like only "sync-on-green" property is missing. BTW, is it really
commonly used ? What drivers would need it ?
I'm not against making it a common property, it's just first time I see it.

Thanks,
Sylwester
