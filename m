I see. So if you think it is nice to get dvb-core, make a wrapper around
to get it usable in userspace and maintain totally same functionality
by myself then I say it is no go. If it looks for you like good idea
I must disagree. Code duplication? Two maintaners? That is crazy idea man.

It is only your POV that it should be in userspace.

Creating additional code which not only enlarge code size by 2
but I think by 10 is really not good idea.  And it get no advantage
only disadvantages.

Sure. I was prepared for technical disscussion, but was fully suprised
that it was not happend (ok, to be correct, few guys are exception, like
Andreas and few others. I really appreciate it).

So, my question was still not answered: "Can be driver NACKed only
because of worrying about possible misuse?"
