Well, you can use ir-keytable to disable everything but lirc, not
compile the other hardware decoders or directly write "lirc" to 
/sys/class/rc/rc0/protocols (see Documentation/ABI/testing/sysfs-class-rc).

Anyway, I suggest you to use the hardware decoder instead of lirc,
as the in-kernel decoders should be lighter than lirc and works pretty
well, but this is, of course, your decision. 

Btw, it would make sense, IMHO, to have a way to setup LIRC daemon to
enable LIRC output on a given remote controller, and, optionally,
disabling the hardware decoders that are needlessly enabled.

Mauro
