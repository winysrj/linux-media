Steve Toth is the guy working on this driver. He started and has the 
basic framework for a driver two months ago, then there was some 
organizational things he was working on and he complained recently about 
not being allowed enough time to work on this. Since he works for 
Hauppauge, I'm guessing it's a work related issue.

He's been pretty quiet, though, for the last week or so, so I'm hoping 
that means he's got his nose to the grindstone and is cranking out code. :)

I am running Xubuntu, and would LOVE to turn my machine into a MythBuntu box.  I have pretty decent knowledge of Linux and Ubuntu, might even be able to contribute some code on this.
