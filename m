Actually, it simplifies the thinking: less lines to read and the function
return code is clearly defined.

Nah, the above sucks: it is just hiding the return if error. Having to
go until the end of a function to see what "err" would do is not good.
Ok, if you have to deallocate things, do mutex unlock, etc, it is
justifiable.

However, in this case, it is quite a deception to discover that,
after going all the way down the code, "err" is just 
do-nothing-but-return.

The above code is exactly why several academic professors forbid the
usage of goto: the code can easily become hard to read if you use lots
of goto, instead of using structured loops and returns.
