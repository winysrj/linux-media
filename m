There is some dummy drivers based on an earlier version.  And airlied
has a prime (multi-gpu) prototype:

http://cgit.freedesktop.org/~airlied/linux/log/?h=drm-prime-dmabuf

I've got a nearly working camera+display prototype:

I think you can do physical migration if you are attached, but
probably not if you are mapped.

My original thinking was that you either need DMABUF_CPU_{PREP,FINI}
ioctls and corresponding dmabuf ops, which userspace is required to
call before / after CPU access.  Or just remove mmap() and do the
mmap() via allocating device and use that device's equivalent
DRM_XYZ_GEM_CPU_{PREP,FINI} or DRM_XYZ_GEM_SET_DOMAIN ioctls.  That
would give you a way to (a) synchronize with gpu/asynchronous
pipeline, (b) synchronize w/ multiple hw devices vs cpu accessing
buffer (ie. wait all devices have dma_buf_unmap_attachment'd).  And
that gives you a convenient place to do cache operations on
noncoherent architecture.

I sort of preferred having the DMABUF shim because that lets you pass
a buffer around userspace without the receiving code knowing about a
device specific API.  But the problem I eventually came around to: if
your GL stack (or some other userspace component) is batching up
commands before submission to kernel, the buffers you need to wait for
completion might not even be submitted yet.  So from kernel
perspective they are "ready" for cpu access.  Even though in fact they
are not in a consistent state from rendering perspective.  I don't
really know a sane way to deal with that.  Maybe the approach instead
should be a userspace level API (in libkms/libdrm?) to provide
abstraction for userspace access to buffers rather than dealing with
this at the kernel level.
