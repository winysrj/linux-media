Please stop with the flames... this is ridiculous.

It's true that not everybody gets along well, but it is also true that
both of the developers that you've mentioned here are highly
intelligent and really know how to do what they do.

This is open-source development.  There is no reason to tell somebody
to STOP working for free.

These flames are the reason why the active developers that DO get
stuff done have stopped following the mailing lists.

I have my gmail set to forward mails to me that I'll find interesting,
based on keywords and filters.  Every once in a while, I see a flame
like this and it reminds me why I'd rather write new code than read
about people complaining.

Get over it.  The longer this keeps up, the more of an audience will
be lost.  The amount of people that read this list is dwindling every
day.

Next time you want to flame, think twice.  You might think that you're
making a statement, but all you're doing is pushing the developers
away from the mailing lists.

(all of the above is directed to the flamers) ...

side note:

Markus, you and I should definitely have a beer sometime.  I think
we'd really get along in person.  Emails and chat suck -- you will
never get a feel for personality that way.  Let me know next time
you're in New York City.  I have never been to Europe, but I do hope
to visit one day.

It's snowing here in New York -- I plan to write code all weekend.
Y'all should keep your pants on, and maybe you'll realize that there
really is nothing to complain about.  Free work == no bitching
allowed!

/rant
