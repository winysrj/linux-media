Yes - RX and TX are independent of band selection

As of now when I switch to new band I just set the frequency to lowest
of the new band.
In this way user can seek and tune to what ever channel he wants.

Our chip wont have 2 receivers, it has only 1 receiver which can
receive on whole frequency range from 65 MHz to 165 MHz.

Sorry our newest chipset supports this feature so yet now we don't
have any datasheet available on net.

you wants me to do this from driver itself without hinting the
application about the band ?
