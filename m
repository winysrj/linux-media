Hallo

I have a Terratec Cinergy HTC USB XS Stick and want to use this with
Me-TV in order to record and view TV via Cable (Germany).

My research shows that a driver is in development under this link
http://mcentral.de/wiki/index.php5?title=Terratec_HTC_XS&oldid=2804.

This link offers no instructions to installation, I was hoping that it
would be included In Ubuntu Jaunty, alas to no avail. I am hoping that
you can help me further or at least tell me in which Kernel release this
driver will be integrated.

Thanks in advance
Peter Hoyland
