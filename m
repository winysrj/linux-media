You have to be able to stream from a video node /dev/video24 when /dev/radio is open.  /dev/radio is a control only node.  (Under current spec behavior.)

Also there is at least one non-test app out there, brought up on the ivtv lists a few months ago in the context of v4l2 priorty handling, that, IIRC, makes calls on /dev/video24 with /dev/radio open.

Andy
