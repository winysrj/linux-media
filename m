I've applied the fix locally, using ENOTTY, and tested with 3 drivers that
have several non-implemented ioctl's: vivi, uvcvideo and gspca (they basically
don't implement tuner ioctl's. The uvcvideo doesn't implement the *STD ioctls,
and the gspca driver doesn't implement the ENUM_FRAME* ioctl's).

I tested with camorama (using libv4l1 conversion code), vlc, qv4l2, xawtv3 and 
mplayer. I also tested two closed source applications (Skype and flash - at twitcam). 
With all drivers, the applications worked as expected.

There is just a minor glitch with xawtv3, as it currently doesn't print an
error log if VIDIOC_G_STD returns -EINVAL when debug is disabled.
Yet, the error is not fatal and happens only once, during device probing.
Xawtv works fine, and suppressing the noise is an easy fix. As we're releasing 
version 1.101 of it with alsa streaming support, I'll latter add a code there
fixing it.

Complex TV applications like mythtv won't work if the devices don't implement
tuner and control ioctl's. I don't believe that it would fail if we change the
return code for unimplemented ioctls, because if an ioctl that mythtv
needs is not implemented, it will fail anyway. Unfortunately, installing
mythtv is a very complex task, and requires hours/days of work. I can't
affort to install it for testing ATM, but I'm sure others have it installed,
and can provide us some feedback.

So, I'll prepare the patches for replacing EINVAL to ENOTTY and add it at
next. This'll give us some time to get feedback about eventual breakages
on other tools that I didn't test.

Thanks,
Mauro
