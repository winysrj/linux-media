That could work well, but the first idea could be done globally and
mechanically, while this would require very careful per-driver
investigation. 

Particularly if the core code has worse performance.. ie due to
kmalloc calls or something.

I think it would make more sense to start by having the core do the
case to __user and then add another entry point to have the core do
the copy_from_user, and so on.
