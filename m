In your opinion. Are you a qualified IP attorney - NO. Are you my lawyer
- NO. Does my laywer disagree with you - YES.

In your personal viewpoint. I disagree. I'm a rights holder too. 

Several rights holders have made it clear the change is not wanted. It's
over, done, buried. If you want it can go as far as Linus and then he can
get a copy of all the discussion and say that same as he did in the
classic video.

Should I start submitting all the Intel non-free user space X drivers at
this point as there seems to be a dramatic policy change going on here ?
