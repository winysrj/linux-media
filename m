    Hi, is there anyone actually working on this?

    I cannot program for the life of me (for now) si, I'd like some 
assistance?

    I can get the SAA to be seen on the I2C bus, and a scan doesn't 
reveal the true addresses of the chips behind it (along with the 
previously seen reports of the addresses of the devices.

    I have manually probed and have obtained the actual I2C addressing 
of most of the chips (except for the XC device, BGA's are difficult, and 
the PRO1A, well I havn't gone to the length of X-ray'ing it yet, but 
maybe I'll have to give that a go (X-ray to get the die information, 
then try and resolve its function from that info) or I'll just power the 
device and see what it does.. wish i still had the "Pinpoint" system at 
my disposal.
   
    So, I'm looking for help, or a group to chat with to try and help 
this little device along ;o)
