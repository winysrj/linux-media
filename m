For the TV versus radio switch the gpio mask is just 0x0200000.

With this mask only gpio pin 21 will change.

By default the driver will set it to 0, only for that input gpio =
0x0200000 is set in the card's config, it will change it to 1.
(masked writes, "modinfo saa7134" gpio_tracking=1)

If changing the amux to LINE1 doesn't help for s-video and composite,
testing with saa7134-alsa there and say sox, then regspy might help.

If you use the supplied m$ app, not DScaler, and save the logs for the
card in status unused, TV, composite/s-video and radio, we will see the
gpio mask in use there and likely changing gpio pins.

They often have more pins in the mask and also more that change,
but usually one of them will be what we need to add to the mask.

It looks like manufacturers group their devices together with a gpio
mask covering so far all of them, then subsets of devices do appear,
which still do more changes on the pins, then for a specific single
device would be needed.

With a high granularity for each device, based on a doubtless and
consistent eeprom detection, the gpio settings likely could be single
device specific too, if wanted.

But since we might see unrelated gpio changes there too, dunno, first of
all make sure that amux LINE1 does not resolve the problem.

Cheers,
Hermann
