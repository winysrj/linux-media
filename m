what is the recommended way to scan?

scan/dvbscan/scan-s2/w_scan/dvbv5-scan

i am more than a little confused.

this whole area seems to be abandonware.

i can scan with pretty much any of these and get DVB-S signals
but what should i use to get DVB-S2

tuner is a Tevii S660
it will receive DVB-S2 as i can use Kaffeine to scan

i also want to scan a KA sat
but i'll leave that for another day
