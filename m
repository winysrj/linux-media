I can confirm this. Almost every channel is encrypted apart from a few 
apparently random exceptions. I can watch NL 1 and Comedy Central FTA 
even though they're completely unrelated and Comedy Central is even part 
of an optional package if I recall correctly.. strange. Many radio 
channels are freely available though.

Last night I made a couple of new attempts, recompiling the very latest 
mantis driver on my Debian box. The card gets detected properly, as 
usual, but now I notice something new. I get an error message: DVB: 
invalid PC card inserted :(

I assume that has to do with the Alphacrypt I have installed in my 
Mantis board? I have yet to pull it out and test again but so far, with 
the Alphacrypt inserted, there's still no result whatsoever. After some 
loud protest from my girlfriend I had to give up, reboot into Windows 
and let her watch her favorite detective.. So frustrating!

Thanks for everyone's help so far though.

Bas
