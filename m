I'm not 100% sure that would be the right fix, but I think so. Haven't 
looked at the driver.

Could you paste the output from lsmod?

Where did you get the driver? Is it this one?

Yes. The ir-nec-decoder timer doesn't know what the hardware is up to so 
it could timeout because it didn't get more data in time while at the 
same time the driver is buffering data...
