I don't think that's needed. You can transfer a number of bytes not multiple 
of the page size using DMA. This is true for DMABUF as well, an imported 
buffer might have a size not aligned on a page boundary.

Can't we just round the size up at allocation time and when checking the size 
in mmap() ? That's a simple fix, local to vb2, and won't require new vb2 
memops.
