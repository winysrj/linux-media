Okay.  Are PHYs _always_ platform devices?

It must also be embedded in the PHY's platform data somehow.  
Otherwise, how would the kernel know which PHY to use?

The ability for two different source files to share a pointer to a data 
item defined in a third source file has been around since long before 
the C language was invented.  :-)

In this case, it doesn't matter where the platform_device structures 
are created or where the driver source code is.  Let's take a simple 
example.  Suppose the system design includes a PHY named "foo".  Then 
the board file could contain:

struct phy_info { ... } phy_foo;
EXPORT_SYMBOL_GPL(phy_foo);

and a header file would contain:

extern struct phy_info phy_foo;

The PHY supplier could then call phy_create(&phy_foo), and the PHY 
client could call phy_find(&phy_foo).  Or something like that; make up 
your own structure tags and function names.

It's still possible to have conflicts, but now two PHYs with the same 
name (or a misspelled name somewhere) will cause an error at link time.
