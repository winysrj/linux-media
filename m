Well, since you mention it....

http://git.linuxtv.org/media_tree.git?a=blob;f=drivers/media/video/cx18/cx18-driver.c;h=9e2f870f4258665ae6093c762f752d45147a8c98;hb=staging/for_v3.1#l252
http://git.linuxtv.org/media_tree.git?a=blob;f=drivers/media/video/ivtv/ivtv-driver.c;h=0fb75524484d909af4925c3c33c9f12cf6d6519e;hb=staging/for_v3.1#l280

However, since I often must ask for the output of v4l2-ctl --log-status,
which already has the version number, I never need to ask the user to
run /sbin/modinfo for the version.

Andy
