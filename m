A reroll.  As before, the goals are: (1) eliminate deadlock, (2)
eliminate races, (3) introduce some clarity.  The same caveats as
last time apply --- this is only compile-tested.  Thanks again to Andi
for testing the previous series and for other useful feedback.

Patch 1 is meant to protect dev->drvlist against data races.
Since v1, I removed some clutter in the patch itself and clarified the
change description to match.

Patch 2 addresses the original deadlock.  The only changes are the
description and declared authorship of the patch (at Ben's request).

Patch 3 is new.  It fixes the reference count breakage Andi noticed
(another race previously protected against by the BKL).

Patch 4 fixes a data race noticed by Ben (also from his patch).  It's
unchanged.

Patches 5, 6, and 7 are cleanups.

Bugs?  Thoughts?
