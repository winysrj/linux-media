Some of them do, but the new API requires changes in both the DMA master and
slave drivers, so that could be changed if we wanted to, or we just allow 
both methods indefinitely and let sa11x0-dma pass the filterfn+data rather than
a number.

I thought we already had ;-)

It certainly makes the transition to a map table much easier.

Correct. A lot of dmaengine drivers already need to be built-in so the platform
code can put a pointer to the filter function, so it would not be worse for them.

Another idea would be to remove the filter function from struct dma_chan_map
and pass the map through platform data to the dmaengine driver, which then
registers it to the core along with the mask. Something like:

/* platform code */
static struct dma_chan_map oma_dma_map[] = {
 	{ .devname = "omap-aes0", .slave = "tx", .arg = (void *)65, },
 	{ .devname = "omap-aes0", .slave = "rx", .arg = (void *)66, },
	...
	{},
};

static struct omap_system_dma_plat_info dma_plat_info __initdata = {
	.dma_map = &oma_dma_map,
	...
};      

machine_init(void)
{
	...
	platform_device_register_data(NULL, "omap-dma-engine", 0, &dma_plat_info, sizeof(dma_plat_info);
	...
}

/* dmaengine driver */

static int omap_dma_probe(struct platform_device *pdev)
{
	struct omap_system_dma_plat_info *pdata = dev_get_platdata(&pdev->dev);
	...

	dmam_register_platform_map(&pdev->dev, omap_dma_filter_fn, pdata->dma_map);
}

/* dmaengine core */

struct dma_map_list {
	struct list_head node;
	struct device *master;
	dma_filter_fn filter;
	struct dma_chan_map *map;
};

static LIST_HEAD(dma_map_list);
static DEFINE_MUTEX(dma_map_mutex);

int dmam_register_platform_map(struct device *dev, dma_filter_fn filter, struct dma_chan_map *map)
{
	struct dma_map_list *list = kmalloc(sizeof(*list), GFP_KERNEL);

	if (!list)
		return -ENOMEM;

	list->dev = dev;
	list->filter = filter;
	list->map = map;

	mutex_lock(&dma_map_mutex);
	list_add(&dma_map_list, &list->node);
	mutex_unlock(&dma_map_mutex);
}

Now we can completely remove the dependency on the filter function definition
from platform code and slave drivers.
