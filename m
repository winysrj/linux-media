Hello there!
I am new to IPTV and Video4Linux. I need to implement an IPTV solution that would stream DVB satellite channels in a network. What is the satellite receiver do you recommend me to use on my Linux Centos 6.4 server? The satellite receiver should support encrypted channels. Is it better to use a USB or PCIe receiver? Another question, I'm thinking of using VLC for streaming, do you recommend a better streaming software for my case?
Thanks a lot,
Firas
