Hi Mauro,

We don't maintain a separate tree for these v4l2 drivers. We generally
use the linux-omap tree for our day to day activities, However the
drivers posted here has also been tested on the linux-2.6.37-rc7,
So it is directly applicable on the k.org tree.

So, I was hoping you can merge these patches on the v4l2 tree on the
kernel.org and thereby it gets pulled into the mainline, when linus
would pull your tree.

It would also help for us for it to be on v4l2 tree, since it would
mean you and Hans have also reviewed it :).

Regards
Manjunatha Halli
