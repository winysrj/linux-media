Hi, as an owner of a Tasco/Aveo USB microscope detected but not
working under Linux, I'd really like to see the patch adding this
variant added to the kernel.  I've copied the patch's author on the
email.
The people on the linux-uvc-devel list directed me over here.

The patch here:
http://sourceforge.net/p/linux-uvc/mailman/message/32434617/ , itself
an update of an earlier patch:
http://sourceforge.net/p/linux-uvc/mailman/message/29835445/ works.
The patch does make the USB microscope work where it didn't work at all before.

Thank you!
