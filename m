Yes, this is just typical I2C register read I2C messsage. The first line
specifies what register should be read (the content of msgbuf0), with is
a one char value, and the second line stores the registers contents at
msgbuf1.

This is exactly what I said before: this is a typical situation:

Just one macro could be used for that, with 4 parameters:

	I2C_MSG_READ_SUBADDR(addr, sub_addr, len, buf);

Almost all of those I2C messages will fall on 3 cases only:
	- a read msg (3 parameters, 1 msg);
	- a write message (3 parameters, 1 msg);
	- a write subaddr followed by a read (4 parameters, 2 msgs).

You'll find very few exceptions to it, where additional I2C flags are
needed, or several different transactions were grouped together, due
to the I2C locking or in order to use I2C repeat-start mode[1].

In a matter of fact, as the maintainer, I prefer to fully see the entire
I2C message for those exceptions, as those other usages require more care
while reviewing/merging.


[1] very, very few media i2c bus drivers implement any other flags except
for I2C_M_RD. That's why it is so rare to see them there.
