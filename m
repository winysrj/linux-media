I think this is a really good v1 version of dma_buf. It contains all the
required bits (with well-specified semantics in the doc patch) to
implement some basic use-cases and start fleshing out the integration with
various subsystem (like drm and v4l). All the things still under
discussion like
- userspace mmap support
- more advanced (and more strictly specified) coherency models
- and shared infrastructure for implementing exporters
are imo much clearer once we have a few example drivers at hand and a
better understanding of some of the insane corner cases we need to be able
to handle.

And I think any risk that the resulting clarifications will break a basic
use-case is really minimal, so I think it'd be great if this could go into
3.3 (maybe as some kind of staging/experimental infrastructure).

Hence for both patches:
