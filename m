I see linux-media, you can find the sources of a patched tvtime version on the
website.
It shows an alternative way how to integrate usb chipsolutions in linux.
Aside of that the official DVB(3/5)/V4L(1/2) API has been reviewed
through our work and bugreports have been
submitted to various places (linux media, some linux distributions).
It integrates
flawlessly and helps to improve the overall media support with linux.

The posting was pointing out to Ali's email that he was looking
for a working analog TV solution for France. He has bought this
Pinnacle device 3 years ago,
the vendor does not care about support for it.
We provide solutions which work within a few seconds, nevermind what
distribution.

Although this was my last mail addressing your questions.

Best Regards,
Markus Rechberger
