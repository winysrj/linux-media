You got this wrong, sorry.

In my case, there are three physical devices:

adp1653
	white LED
	red LED

Each LED should have an label, and probably default trigger -- default
trigger for red one should be "we are recording video" and for white
should be "this is flash for default camera".

If the hardware LED changes with one that needs different current, the
block for the adp1653 stays the same, but white LED block should be
updated with different value.

That is not how it currently works.

Agreed about per-led, disagreed about the array. As all the fields
would need arrays, and as LED system currently does not use arrays for
label and linux,default-trigger, I believe we should follow existing
design and model it as three devices. (It _is_ physically three devices.)

Agreed.
