So is the table at http://linuxtv.org/wiki/index.php/DVB-T_USB_Devices 
incorrect?

It says:

Conceptronic USB2.0 DVB-T CTVDIGRCU V3.0 	
  âœ” Yes, in kernel since 2.6.31
1b80:e397 USB2.0 	
Afatech AF9015


Anyway, I see there are other sticks with chipsets by Afatech. Is there 
any chance that some of the currently implemented driver would work fine 
with my chipset if only I forced the driver to recognize the chipset as 
another one by touching the source code?
How could I try that? (if it deserves a try)

Thanks
