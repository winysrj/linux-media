OK.

No, I thought about two port sub-nodes of a single device node, one for the
TVP7002 video input and one for the output. But it seems there is no need
for that, i.e. to specify the input configuration statically in the 
firmware.
The chip detects the signals automatically, i.e. it uses whatever is 
available,
and it allows querying the selection status at run time. What would really
need to be configured statically in DT in that case then ? Some initial 
video
sync configuration ? I guess it could be well hard coded in the driver, 
since
the hardware does run time detection anyway.

It there are real use cases I gues we could add video-sync property or 
similar,
besides the existing signal polarity properties.
