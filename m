Well, it is simple: we should either revert the patch(es) that broke it or
someone should fix it at em28xx. If nobody could fix it, I'll just revert
the patches that broke it and ask -stable to do the same.

Btw, 3.10 is a long term stable, so, it is not too late for fixes there.

Ok, but this doesn't solve one issue: who would do it and when.
