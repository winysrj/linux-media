Yes, that is exactly what I'm concerned about. I think it is important
to be able to have an unambiguous dependency graph. In most cases, only
the driver for a component will actually know which links are
dependencies, and which are optional.... And that doesn't even address hot
plug!

If a component is sufficiently complex that the routing is dynamic and
'downstream' components may or may not be present/usable, then there
just has to be a driver that understands its behaviour; either
integrated into the master driver, or a separate driver that abstracts
it from the master driver.
