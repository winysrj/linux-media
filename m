  Makes sense.

  Good point. I'll try to come up with a better name.

  No. It was there just because I had ints everywhere without too much
thought (it's shorter to type *grin*). I'll put unsigned types where it
makes sense and add a test for INT_MAX so that get_vaddr_pfns() can still
return negative errors.

  Yep, good idea.

  Yes. See above.

  Good point. Will add that.

  So the only real case where we could have 0 here is when get_user_pages()
returns 0 for whatever reason. It seemed better to me to translate 0 to
-EFAULT since all the drivers I saw did that anyway (at least those that
didn't forget about checking for 0). It just seems as a less error-prone
interface to return error or number > 0. I agree that -EFAULT doesn't
necessarily always make sense so if you have idea for a better error I'm
open to suggestions.

  So this case should have covered the situation when we have a vector of
normal pages (thus got_ref == 1) and convert that to a vector of pfns.
Noone currently does that and that function for conversion even doesn't
seem to exist but it seems to me at least omap driver may need it and the
conversion I did has a bug. Anyway, I'll recheck the situation and either
drop this or make the function more comprehensible.

  I've just followed what __get_user_pages() does...

  Exactly.

  Thanks a lot for review Mel!
