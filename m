  Thanks!

  My motivation is that currently filesystems have to workaround locking
problems with ->page_mkwrite() (the write page fault handler) being called
with mmap_sem held. The plan is to provide ability to ->page_mkwrite()
handler to drop mmap_sem. And that needs an audit of all get_user_pages()
callers to verify they won't be broken by this locking change. So I've
started with making this audit simpler.

  Yeah, I've read about this in some comment in V4L2. Also there are some
places (drivers/media/platform/omap/omap_vout.c and
drivers/media/v4l2-core/) which acquire mmap_sem pretty early to avoid lock
inversion with the queue lock. These are actually causing me quite some
headache :)

  OK, I can add the comment. Thanks for review.
