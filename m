Yeah, I was just reading through your patchset and there are a lot of
similarities. Though, I'm not sure what you're trying to accomplish as I
could not find a cover letter and it seems to only enable one driver. Is
it meant to enable DMA transactions only between two AMD GPUs?

I also don't see where you've taken into account the PCI bus address. On
some architectures this is not the same as the CPU physical address.

We've taken a general approach where some drivers may provide p2p memory
(ie. an NVMe card or an RDMA NIC) and other drivers make use of it (ie.
the NVMe-of driver). The orchestrator driver needs to find the most
applicable provider device for a transaction in a situation that may
have multiple providers and multiple clients. So the most applicable
provider is the one that's closest ("distance"-wise) to all the clients
for the P2P transaction.

Maybe on x86 with hardware made in the last few years. But on PowerPC,
ARM64, and likely a lot more the chance of support is *much* less. Also,
hardware that only supports P2P stores is hardly full support and is
insufficient for our needs.

I think a whitelist approach is correct. Given old hardware and other
architectures, a black list is going to be too long and too difficult to
comprehensively populate.
