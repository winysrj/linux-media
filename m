Well, Jason, at least you have some company in that regard; see the
following recent threads:

No.   At this point, I doubt that support for the Theater 550, 600 & 650
component parts, and consequently any of the devices that use them, will
ever be ascertained  ...  specifically, I doubt AMD/ATI  will ever
provide documentation for these chips, and, as they're not simplistic
parts, can understand why any developer would loathe the idea of trying
to reverse engineer support for them on their own.

Unlike their support for the graphics card end, it hasn't struck me that
AMD/ATI are too concerned about support for their multimedia product
portfolio....hmm, and now that I think about it, I wonder if rights to
these products also fell under a part of the recent Broadcom purchase
(of some ATI assets).
