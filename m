Whether multiple nodes are possible for a device is indeed known to the driver 
author, but the number of endpoints depends on the board. In most cases 
multiple endpoints are possible. If we decide that the level of simplification 
should be set in stone in the device DT bindings (i.e. making the ports and/or 
port nodes required or forbidden, but not optional), then I believe this calls 
for always having a port node even when a single port is needed. I'm fine with 
leaving the ports node out, but having no port node might be too close to 
over-simplification.
