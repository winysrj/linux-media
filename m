It is not a new code that added this logic. The code is there
at least since 2006. It were added on this commit:

All dependencies required by the selected symbols are satisfied. For example,
the simplest case is likely cafe_ccic, as, currently, there's just one possible
driver that can be attached dynamically at runtime to cafe_ccic. We have:

menu "Encoders/decoders and other helper chips"
	depends on !VIDEO_HELPER_CHIPS_AUTO

...
config VIDEO_OV7670
        tristate "OmniVision OV7670 sensor support"
        depends on I2C && VIDEO_V4L2
...
endmenu

config VIDEO_CAFE_CCIC
        tristate "Marvell 88ALP01 (Cafe) CMOS Camera Controller support"
        depends on PCI && I2C && VIDEO_V4L2
        select VIDEO_OV7670

The dependencies needed by ov7670 (I2C and VIDEO_V4L2) are also dependencies of 
cafe_ccic. So, it shouldn't have any problem for it to work (and it doesn't have,
really. This is working as-is during the last 4 years).

It should be noticed that, even if we replace the menu dependencies by an
If, won't solve. I tried the enclosed patch, to see if it would produce something
that the new Kconfig behavior accepts. The same errors apply.

It is fine for me if you want/need to change the way Kconfig works, provided
that it won't break (or produce those annoying warnings) the existing logic, and
won't open the manual select menu, if the user selects the auto mode.
Just send us a patch changing it to some other way of doing it.

Thanks,
Mauro

Test patch, replacing depends on by if's. It doesn't really work, as Kconfig
seems to be internally converting if's into depends. So, no warning is removed.
