Hi Mauro,

I see that this patch got applied to the media_tree master, but then
reverted a few days ago. Do you think the G_TOPOLOGY IOCTL and the
associated user space structs are ready for being included in a release?

I have a few concerns over the current interface, in decreasing order of
importance:

- G_TOPOLOGY IOCTL is intended to enable dynamic updates, but do we have a
  driver actually supporting this? For instance, supposing that the users's
  knowledge of the graph state isn't what the user expected it to be
  (assuming the graph state changed between G_TOPOLOGY and SETUP_LINK), does
  the user still want to perform the SETUP_LINK IOCTL or would the user
  prefer that the kernel returned an error instead to tell the user has no
  knowledge of the current graph state? I'd like to see how that works in
  practice. For instance, a virtual driver such as vivi, but with MC, V4L2
  sub-device and V4L2 support which adds and removes a random entity every,
  say, five minutes, would be wonderful. If this has not been tried out in a
  real use case, the chances of getting it right may remain rather slim.

- struct media_v2_pad contains fields called "id" and "entity_id". The "id"
  field, as far as I understand, is the graph object id, not the pad index.
  In order to configure a link using MEDIA_IOC_SETUP_LINK, one does need to
  know the entity id and the pad index. This information you'll only get
  using MEDIA_IOC_ENUM_LINKS, which right now refutes the very purpose of
  the G_TOPOLOGY IOCTL. Knowing the pad indices is also essential for the
  V4L2 sub-device user space API. (I remember whether or not the pad index
  should be there but I don't remember the details, except that it was
  intentionally left out. Considering this again, I think adding it is
  unavoidable.) This together with the above point suggest there are no
  real applications using G_TOPOLOGY yet.

- Some more thought should be given to the state of the reserved fields, in
  e.g. struct media_v2_pad there are __u32 fields only, except a reserved
  field which is a __u16 array of 9. While this isn't exactly wrong it makes
  no sense either.

- KernelDoc documentation would be nice for the G_TOPOLOGY argument structs.
  DocBook documentation for G_TOPOLOGY as itself is fine, but I think it
  reflects an older version of the structs than what's now defined in
  include/uapi/linux/media.h.

Please give some thought on this. There are some obvious gaps that need to
be filled, and when doing so, I don't think we want to start guessing
whether there might be an application that depends on the current API/ABI.

If you'd like the G_TOPOLOGY IOCTL and its argument structs to be available
for developers without kernel changes, I propose to add a new Kconfig option
for G_TOPOLOGY and make it depend on BROKEN.

What do you think?
