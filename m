After all those discussions, I'm ok on adding this new driver, but please
add a summary of those discussions at the patch description. As I said,
the reason why this driver is needed is not obvious. So, it needs to be
very well described.

Your new "v3 3/4" patch seems OK on my eyes (I can't test it, as I don't
have the hardware). Yet, there was one merge conflict on it.

Patch 1/4 of this series doesn't apply anymore (maybe it were already
applied?).

So, could you please send us a v4, rebased on the top of staging/for_v3.9
branch of the media-tree?

Thanks!
Mauro
