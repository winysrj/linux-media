I should thank you for the wonderful proof-of-concept patch, and the
idea behind it! I am currently working on the V4L2 side patch for it,
and would send out the RFC soon.
Also, thanks for a good review and some pertinent points; replies inline.

These are the standard file mode flags, which can be used to do
file-level access-type control by the exporter, so for example
write-access can be denied for  a buffer exported as a read-only
buffer.

priv will be used by the exporter to attach its own context to the dma

You are right, there is currently no generic way for attribute
negotiation for buffers of multiple devices. However, since buffer
sharing idea itself is about allowing for buffer allocation and
migration based on 'some' negotiation, the attachment idea makes it
easier to do so.

What you choose to call 'more or less hacky solution', I would call
'platform-specific mechanism' for negotiation, allocation (and
migration if possible and required). :)

I quite like what you said - the problem of having a 'generic'
mechanism of DMA attribute negotiation might not have been solved yet,
and so the exporter drivers shouldn't need to try to do that.
However, exporter drivers would most likely know about the negotiation
etc needed and possible on their given platform - and the attachment
mechanism gives them a way to gather requirements from participating
DMA users, and use it for such decisions.

That is correct for V4L2_MEMORY_MMAP; should that need to be a
requirement even for V4L2_MEMORY_DMABUF_USER memory type? [I am
deliberately distinguishing a V4L2 driver which is a shared buffer
exporter from a V4L2 shared-buffer-user driver] - could we not do a
get_scatterlist on each VIDIOC_QBUF, and put_scatterlist on each
VIDIOC_DQBUF?

It might be prudent to do so in the media drivers. But the buffer
sharing mechanism is also useful for other, non-media usecases? I
would say that we should be able to leave enough flexibility.

Sure, that's a good idea - I could do that.

There's already a discussion between Rob and David on this mail-chain
earlier; I guess we'll need to wait a little before deciding to remove
this.
