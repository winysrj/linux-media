I was waiting for a final confirmation. I was under the impression some rework
was needed, and seeing Michael's NAK confirms that.

I'd be glad to take them through the m68k tree (for 3.15), once they have
received testing and Michael's ACK. Or the block resp. SCSI maintainers can
take them if they prefer, which apparently already happened for 01/16.

Gr{oetje,eeting}s,

when I'm talking to journalists I just say "programmer" or something like that.
