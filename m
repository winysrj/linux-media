Hmm.... So, the error is on this patch?

	author	Patrick Boettcher <pboettcher@kernellabs.com>	2013-04-22 15:45:52 (GMT)
	[media] dib8000: enhancement

	The intend of this patch is to improve the support of the dib8000. 

	Signed-off-by: Olivier Grenie <olivier.grenie@parrot.com> 
	Signed-off-by: Patrick Boettcher <patrick.boettcher@parrot.com> 
	Signed-off-by: Mauro Carvalho Chehab <mchehab@redhat.com> 

If so, then we need either Olivier or Patrick's help, as I don't have any
documentation about the dib8000 chips.

You can still take a look there at the code that checks for the
chipset version, like:
	if (state->revision == 0x8090) {
		<some code for newer version>
	} else {
		<some code for the old version>
	}

If the code for the old version remains the same as before the patch.
Where it doesn't remains the same, then it could be the source of the
troubles.

I suggest you to check what state->revision shows on your specific device,
in order to do such analysis.

I'll try latter to do some tests with the devices I have, but this could
take some time, as I'm really busy those days.

Regards,
Mauro
