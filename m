Any furthur comment on this? As I noted, I strongly disagree and would
point out that there is no shortage of precedent for the use of
userspace callbacks for loading of firmware, especially when the process
is as tricky as this.

I also work with Altera FPGAs and have a strong interest in making this
work yet from my perspective it seems pretty clear that the best way
forward both for both maintainability and useability is to keep
this code in user-space. There is absolutely no reason why this code
_must_ be in the kernel and punting it out to userspace only requires
a udev rule.

Placing this functionality in userspace results in a massive duplication
of code, as there are already a number of functional user-space JTAG
implementations.

Sure, but there should be agreement that a kernel-mode JTAG state
machine really is the best way forward (i.e. necessary for effective
firmware upload) before we commit to carry this code around forever.
