Hi,

I've been trying to adapt the analog TV support from the HVR-1800 to my
HVR-1500 which has a cx23885 and a xc3028 tuner, so far I've been able
to make the tuner work and changing channels works, but the image is
too distorted and there's no sound.

I'd like to know how complete is the analog TV support for the cx23885
and how much different is the HVR-1500 with respect to the HVR-1800
so maybe I could make it work well.

There's no digital TV in my country so analog TV support is what I need.

Best regards.
