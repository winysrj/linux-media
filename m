Patch looks good, two bikesheds inline. Either way

I think using dma_fence_ops here is the better color. We lose type-safety
at compile-time, but still keep type-safety at runtime (thanks to
to_dma_seqno_fence). In addition people seem to like to constify function
pointers, we'd save a pointer and if we extend the sw dma_fence interface.

I think adding an is_dma_seqno_fence would be nice ...
