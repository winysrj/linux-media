Yes, does not work for me for both YUV422 interleaved and rgb565.
What is captured is an image that have in the bottom half the violet 
color and in the upper half, half of the real image (divided 
vertically) with even rows on the left and odd rows on the right.

Yes, this is the way I told about: dividing the geometry fixes from the 
special YUV422 support.

Yes, sure. I'll try to explain better what the single patches are 
fixing, improving especially for these core functionality.
