Thanks a lot!

Ok, both of them should have my fixes coming your way already.

Right, the patches crossed here, the bugfix patch that introduced
this came into linux-next over the kernel summit, and the fix I
sent on Tuesday made it into Mark Brown's tree on Wednesday but not
before you pulled alsa tree. It should be fixed the next time you
pull from the alsa tree, the commit is

3b89e4b77ef9 ("ASoC: lpass-platform: initialize dma channel number")

This is the one I mentioned in the commit message as one that
is fixed in linux-next and that should make it in soon.

Right, that was my conclusion too. I sent the bugfix on Oct 25
for linux-next but it didn't make it in until this Monday, after
you pulled the patch that introduced it on Oct 29.

The commit in staging-testing is
32cb7d27e65d ("iio: maxim_thermocouple: detect invalid storage size in read()")

Greg and Jonathan, I see now that this is part of the 'iio-for-4.10b'
branch, so I suspect you were not planning to send this before the
merge window. Could you make sure this ends up in v4.9 so we get
a clean build when -Wmaybe-uninitialized gets enabled again?
