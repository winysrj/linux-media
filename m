Hi,

At FOSDEM on saturday the 3rd of february 2018, there will be another 
graphics DevRoom. URL: https://fosdem.org/2018/

The focus of this DevRoom is of course the same as the previous 
editions, namely:
* Graphics drivers: from display to media to 3d drivers, both in kernel 
or userspace. Be it part of DRM, KMS, (direct)FB, V4L, Xorg, Mesa...
* Input drivers: kernel and userspace.
* Windowing systems: X, Wayland, Mir, directFB, ...
* Even colour management, low level toolkit stuff, and other areas which 
i might have overlooked above are accepted.

Slots will be handed out on a first come, first serve basis. The best 
slots will go to those who apply the earliest. We have the devroom from 
10:30 til 19:00, giving us 8h30, so eight 50 minute talkes and one 20 
minute talk are available.

Talk Submission:
----------------

Like the last few years, the pentabarf system will be used for talk 
submission.

https://penta.fosdem.org/submission/FOSDEM18

Remember that FOSDEM is not like XDC, it's not some 50 odd people 
meeting with a sliding schedule which only gets filled out on the last 
day. Upwards of 10000 people are visiting this event, and most of them 
get a printed booklet or use the schedule on the FOSDEM website or an 
app for their phone to figure out what to watch or participate in next. 
So please put some effort in your talk submission and details.

Since this an open source community event, please refrain from turning 
in a talk that is a pure corporate or product commercial. Also, if you 
are unsure on whether you can come or not (this is FOSDEM, why are you 
not there anyway?), please wait with submitting your talk. Submitting a 
talk and then not turning up because you could not be bothered is a 
sure-fire way to get larted and then to never be allowed to talk again.

When in pentabarf, please give the abstract and description, for both 
the event and the speaker, some thought. The abstract should be a 
shortened description, and the event abstract will sometimes even be 
printed directly in the booklet. BUT, on the website the abstract is 
immediately followed by the full description. If your abstract is fully 
descriptive, while terse, you might get away with just the abstract.

All talks will be recorded, and will be streamed out live, and will 
later be made available as CC-BY after a few days.

As for deadlines, the fosdem organizers want to have a finished schedule 
by the 15th of december. Don't count on this deadline: first come first 
serve! The worst slots will be assigned to those who come last, which 
could be pretty dire given that there is the traditional FOSDEM beer 
event the night before ;)

Please try to re-use your accounts from the previous years, i hope that 
this year you can actually recycle your data. If you have forgotten your 
password, then you can reset it here: 
https://penta.fosdem.org/user/forgot_password If there are any issues, 
just poke me here or on IRC.

Necessary information:
----------------------

Below is a list of what i need to see filled in in pentabarf when you 
apply for a devroom before i consider it a valid submission. Remember: 
first come, first serve. The best slots (which are on saturday 
afternoon) are for the earliest submissions.

On your personal page:
* General:
  * First and last name
  * Nickname
  * Image
* Contact:
  * email address
  * mobile number (this is a very hard requirement as there will be no
   other reliable form of emergency communication on the day)
* Description:
  * Abstract
  * Description

Create an event:
* On the General page:
  * Event title
  * Event subtitle.
  * Track: Graphics Devroom
  * Event type: Lecture (talk) or Meeting (BoF)
* Persons:
  * Add yourself as speaker.
* Description:
  * Abstract:
  * Full Description
* Links:
  * Add relevant links.

Everything else can be ignored or will be filled in by me or the FOSDEM 
organizers. Remember, i will only schedule your talk after the basics 
are somewhat filled in (you still can change them until december 15th).

I will be keeping a keen eye on your submissions and will come back with 
further questions or make small fixes as needed. Feel free to poke me 
with any questions or anything, both on irc (libv@freenode) and on 
email.

That's about it. Hope to see you all at FOSDEM :)

Luc Verhaegen.
