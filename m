Yes, but so the the webcam modes of the different devices, so for
the 5 (not sure if that is the right number) dual-cam mode chipsets
we support there will be 5 drivers, each supporting both the
webcam and the access to pictures stored in memory of the chipset
they support. So 5 chipsets -> 5 drivers each supporting 1 chipset,
and both functions of the single logical device that chipset
represents.

Right, that is not the plan. The plan is to simply stop having 2 drivers
for 1 logical (and physical) block. So we go from 10 drivers, 5 stillcam
+ 5 webcam, to just 5 drivers. We will also likely be able to share
code between the code for the 2 functionalities for things like generic
set / get register functions, initialization, etc.

Regards,

Hans
