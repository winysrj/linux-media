Hmm, no I don't think it avoids the pinning issue entirely. As it stands,
the importer doesn't have a page refcount and so they all rely on the
exporter keeping the dmabuf pages pinned while attached. What can happen
is that given the invalidate cb, the importers can revoke their
attachments, letting the exporter recover the pages/sg, and then start
again from scratch.

That also neatly answers what happens if not all importers provide an
invalidate cb, or fail, the dmabuf remains pinned and the exporter must
retreat.

The intent is that the invalidate is synchronous and immediate, while
locked? We are looking at recursing back into the dma_buf functions to
remove each attachment from the invalidate cb (as well as waiting for
dma), won't that cause some nasty issues?
