Virtual Contiguous Memory Manager.  The version posted by Zach can
be found at: <http://article.gmane.org/gmane.linux.kernel.mm/50090>.
It is an API for managing IO MMU and IO MMU mappings.

Contiguous Memory Manager.  The v4 version can be found at
<http://marc.info/?l=linux-mm&m=128229799415817&w=2>.  It is an API for
allocating large, physically contiguous blocks of memory.

I haven't expected that anyone who haven't already participated in the
discussion about CMA and VCMM will get interested by this patchset
so I was a bit vague in the cover letter.  Sorry about that.

Ignore the code then and look just at the documentation, please.
I wanted to post what I have to receive comments about the general
idea and not necessarily the code itself.  Code is just a mean to show
how I see the implementation of the idea described in the documentation.
Because of all that, I marked the patchset as a RFC rather than a PATCH.
