I'd like to participate in the media mini-summit.
Here are some themes I'd be interested in:

- Helping userspace to use mem2mem devices; clarification of
  encoder/decoder handling, clarification of format/size setting
  in case of dependencies between input and output formats,
  possibly broad categorisation of mem2mem devices (encoder,
  decoder, scaler, rotator, csc/filter, ...)

- Hierarchical media devices - what if you have a lot of media
  entities and some of them are more closely related to each
  other than others.

regards
Philipp
