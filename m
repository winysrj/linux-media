While we don't have an enum capability, in many cases you can deduce
whether a particular ioctl should be supported or not. Usually based on
capabilities, sometimes because certain ioctls allow 'NOP' operations that
allow you to test for their presence.

Of course, drivers are not always consistent here, but that's a separate
problem.

No, but that's because all drivers have an ioctl handler :-) So you never
see ENOTTY.

I would like that as well, but the V4L2 Specification explicitly mentions
EINVAL as the error code if an ioctl is not supported. It has done so
since it was created. You cannot just change that. And closed source
programs may  very well rely on this.

I don't think changing such an important return value is acceptable.

A better approach would be to allow applications to deduce whether ioctls
are (should be) present or not based on capabilities, etc. And document
that in the spec and ensure that drivers do this right.

The v4l2-compliance tool is already checking that where possible.
