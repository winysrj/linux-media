Yes, this is quite theoretical at the moment.

Ah, OK. That makes more sense :-)

For some of our products we have lots of video nodes that just control the
receiver or transmitter (and possibly other related blocks), but leave the
streaming to vendor code where we are forced to use that. So this can be
a lot more common than you might think, although you won't see that appearing
in the kernel.

See my reply to patch 10/18: I see whether streaming is supported or not as a
function (or feature) of the entity, just like a subdev entity can be both
a tuner and a video decoder. I.e. these are properties.

I think the naming issue here shows the problem with your approach. Whereas
having a 'streaming' property simplifies this IMHO.
