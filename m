To be blunt, I'm not shure I fully understand the requirements myself.
But as far as I grasped it, the main problem is that we need memory
which the processor can see as soon as the device has scribbled upon
it. (think caches and the like)

Somewhere down the line, the buffer to usb_control_msg get's to be
a parameter to dma_map_single which is described as part of
the DMA API in Documentation/DMA-API.txt 

The main point I filter out from that is that the memory has to begin
exactly at a cache line boundary... 

I guess (not verified), that the dma api takes sufficient precautions
to abort the dma transfer if a timeout happens.  So freeing _should_
not be an issue. (At least, I would expect big fat warnings everywhere
if that were the case)

I cc'd some people that hopefully will correct me if I'm wrong...

regards,
Flo
