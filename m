Hi Sudhindra,

The ov534 sends images in UVC format, i.e. each packet contains a
12 bytes header and a part of the image. In the header, the 1st byte
contains various indicators, of which the bit 1 (0x02) marks the end
of the image.

To code your sd_pkt_scan(), you have to search in the ms-windows traces
how the images are fragmented, how you may find the start and end of
image and whether some data have to be discarded in the packets.

The last problem to solve is to find how are encoded the images. You
may know it looking also in the ms-winsows traces or, when the driver
will work, in the received images. If you want, I may send you a small
program which displays raw images (done by 'svv -rg') forcing the
encoding.

Good luck!
