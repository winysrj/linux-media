I did use plural when I said "to give the start points...".

If you have a list of starting points in the DT, a "graph helper" or
something could create a runtime representation of the graph at some
early phase during the boot, which would include backlinks. The
individual drivers could use that runtime graph, instead of the DT graph.=


But it still sounds considerably more complex than double-links in DT.
