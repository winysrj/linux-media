What about using a struct clk object ? There has been lots of work in the ARM 
tree to make struct clk generic. I'm not sure if all patches have been pushed 
to mainline yet, but I think that's the direction we should follow.

We go through board code to remove dependencies between drivers. My goal is to 
implement this through struct clk, but I haven't had time to work on that yet.
