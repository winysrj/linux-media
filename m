To be clear, at no point did I say the GPL has been violated.  I am
*asking* if others think this represents a GPL violation since at
first glance it appears that this software very well might.

I don't really have a problem with GPL drivers running on Windows.
But if I were the original author of one of the drivers Abylay has
ported, I might think differently.
