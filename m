I know I've been largely unresponsive regarding this patch, and I'm really 
ashamed for that.

I would have liked to get feedback from Logitech on the issue, but they've 
been mostly silent so far. I'll thus apply your patch even though I'm still 
bothered by the issue, we can always revisit it later if needed.
