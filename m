* Vendors of such equipment have started moving on to ARM (e.g. Broadcom bcm47xx)
* Some of the modern MIPS platforms are now using DT
* Legacy platforms probably won't migrate to either DT or the generic PHY framework

I'm not saying that we can't support legacy board files with the common
PHY framework, but I'd expect things to be much easier if we focus on those
platforms that are actively being worked on for now, to bring an end to the
pointless API discussion.
