Ok, the situation I have in mind is the non-pipelined case: revoking
dma-buf for mmu_invalidate_range or shrink_slab. I would need a
completion event that can be waited on the cpu for all the invalidate
callbacks. (Essentially an atomic_t counter plus struct completion; a
lighter version of dma_fence, I wonder where I've seen that before ;)

Even so, it basically means passing a fence object down to the async
callbacks for them to signal when they are complete. Just to handle the
non-pipelined version. :|
