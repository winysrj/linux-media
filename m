Also, I want to mention that on sparc64 we manage the cache aliasing
state in the page struct.

Until a page is mapped into userspace, we just record the most recent
cpu to store into that page with kernel side mappings.  Once the page
ends up being mapped or the cpu doing kernel side stores changes, we
actually perform the cache flush.

Generally speaking, I think that all actual physical memory the kernel
operates on should have a struct page backing it.  So this whole
discussion of operating on physical memory in scatter lists without
backing page structs feels really foreign to me.
