Just stumbled over one I think: If we have a big graph of connected
things (happens really often for video pipelines). And we want
multiple users to use them in parallel. But sometimes a configuration
change could take way too long and so would unduly stall a 2nd thread
with just a global mutex, then per-object ww_mutexes would be a fit:
You'd start with grabbing all the locks for the objects you want to
change anything with, then grab anything in the graph that you also
need to check. Thanks to loop detection and self-recursion this would
all nicely work out, even for cyclic graphs of objects.
