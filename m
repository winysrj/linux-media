After investigation, my recommendation for fixing the problem is to
revert the patch that is causing the problem.

The reason for this is not that fixing the patch is impossible.
INstead, I'll assert that using the DMX_ADD_PID and DMX_REMOVE_PID in
conjunction with output=DMX_OUT_TSDEMUX_TAP is simply converting the
demux0 device into multiple dynamically created anonymous dvr0 devices,
and that is the wrong thing to do.

I understand the need for sending a single PID TS out to an open demux0
instance as described in this email:

http://www.mail-archive.com/linux-dvb@linuxtv.org/msg29814.html

even though it seems like a slight abuse of the demux0 device.


But sending multiple PIDs out in a TS to the open demux0 device instance
is just an awkward way to essentially dynamically create a dvrN device
associated with filter(s) set on an open demux0 instance.

It would be better, in my opinion, to figure out a way to properly
create and/or associate a dvrN device node with a collection of demuxN
filters.

Maybe just allow creation of a logical demux1 device and dvr1 device and
the use the DVB API calls as is on the new logical devices.

I'm not a DVB apps programmer, so I don't know all the userspace needs
nor if anything is already using the DMX_ADD_PID and DMX_REMOVE_PID
ioctl()s.


Comments?
