Hi, after some kind folks advised me to try ATSC HD reception, I've taken the plunge and signed up for digital cable with Comcast.  I've got the little HD box, a remote...and my trusty WinTV-HVR-1800 ready to go.

The card seems to be properly installed, and my "dmesg" file shows the card is recognized, and I have a "/dev/dvb/adapter0" (and demux0, etc.).  

When the digital signal starts coming in tomorrow, could someone give me a quick list of steps I need to take to watch tv?  I've been pouring over the documents and How-tos and don't really know where to start.  Will Kaffeine's "scan" work for finding channels?  Do I need to use "scandvb"?  Will I see a "video0" device and be able to watch tv with Tvtime?  

I don't need to _record_ tv...just watch it.  And I'm not setting up a dedicated PVR...just trying to get a signal to my computer that I can watch when I feel like procrastinating.

Thanks for any and all help...
