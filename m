We get a lot of very large stack frames using gcc-7.0.1 with the default
-fsanitize-address-use-after-scope --param asan-stack=1 options, which
can easily cause an overflow of the kernel stack, e.g.

To reduce this risk, -fsanitize-address-use-after-scope is now split out
into a separate Kconfig option, vhich cannot be selected at the same
time as KMEMCHECK, leading to stack frames that are smaller than 2
kilobytes most of the time on x86_64. An earlier version of this
patch also prevented combining KASAN_EXTRA with KASAN_INLINE, but that
is no longer necessary with the latest gcc-7.0.1 snapshot.

A lot of warnings with KASAN_EXTRA go away if we disable KMEMCHECK,
as -fsanitize-address-use-after-scope seems to understand the builtin
memcpy, but adds checking code around an extern memcpy call. I had
to work around a circular dependency, as DEBUG_SLAB/SLUB depended
on !KMEMCHECK, while KASAN did it the other way round. Now we handle
both the same way.

All patches to get the frame size below 3072 bytes with KASAN_EXTRA,
and below 2048 bytes without it have been submitted, so we can make
those the default now. Note that KASAN is only supported on arm64
and x86_64 at the moment, and both use 2048 byte stacks by default.
This reverts parts of commit commit 3f181b4 ("lib/Kconfig.debug:
disable -Wframe-larger-than warnings with KASAN=y").

I experimented a bit more with smaller stack frames and have another
follow-up series that reduces the warning limit for 64-bit architectures
to 1280 bytes and 1536 when CONFIG_KASAN (but not KASAN_EXTRA) is
enabled, this requires another ~25 patches to address the additional
warnings.
