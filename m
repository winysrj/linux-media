Note that the code in ipu_csi_init_interface currently hard-codes field
order depending on frame size. It could be that selecting opposite field
order is as easy as switching the relevant parts of writes to registers
CCIR_CODE_2 and _3, but we'd have to pass the desired output field order
to this function. I'd welcome if somebody would verify that this works.
