Steve Toth,

Since you have switched your efforts to his HDPVRCapture and I've got 
this Hauppauge card that looks like it'll never work, I want to make it 
work.

I've never written any hardware drivers for Linux but would like to 
start with trying to write one for the HVR-2250/SAA7164. I'd rather 
spend 200 hours learning how and writing this thing than get stuck 
buying a copy of Windows for my media box.

You mentioned that you had started a basic framework already. Would you 
be willing to let me try moving forward with this project, and are you 
even able to share the Phillips spec? If not, would you be willing to 
help me get added to the Phillips NDA?
