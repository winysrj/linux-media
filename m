Personally I'm generally not in favour of splitting an
open source community in "users" and "developers", but
I guess I'm the odd man out with that POV...

However, similar to that there should be ONE developer
list, I think there should be ONE user list, and not
two. Maybe we should just shut linux-dvb down and ask
users to subscribe to the video4linux list? Or do
people think it's still useful to have distinct lists
for analog and digital?

Either way, IMHO you can't go wrong with moving v4l-dvb-maintainer
to vger so if you agree I'd like to encourage you to go forward with that.
