Dear Linux kernel group

my name is Ludwig Petrosyan I am working in DESY (Germany)

we are responsible for the control system ofÂ  all accelerators in DESY.

For a 7-8 years we have switched to MTCA.4 systems and using PCIe as a 
central Bus.

I am mostly responsible for the Linux drivers of the AMC Cards (PCIe 
endpoints).

The idea is start to use peer to peer transaction for PCIe endpoint (DMA 
and/or usual Read/Write)

Could You please advise me where to start, is there some Documentation 
how to do it.


with best regards


Ludwig

Allowing devices to talk directly improves performance and reduces latency by avoiding the use of staging buffers in system memory.  Also in cases where both devices are behind a switch, it avoids the CPU entirely.  Most current APIs (DirectGMA, PeerDirect, CUDA, HSA) that deal with this are pointer based.  Ideally we'd be able to take a CPU virtual address and be able to get to a physical address taking into account IOMMUs, etc.  Having struct pages for the memory would allow it to work more generally and wouldn't require as much explicit support in drivers that wanted to use it.
