Could this be related to my missing [udev] device nodes?

I can see media-ctl get confused and try to open a nonsense device name.  Here's
what I see when I run
   # strace media-ctl -p | grep open
   open("/dev/media0", O_RDWR)             = 3
   open("", O_RDWR)                        = -1 ENOENT (No such file or directory)
   write(1, "\tpad0: Input v4l2_subdev_open: F"..., 66) = 66
