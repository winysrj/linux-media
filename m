*argh* that fits todays story... My Terratec Prodigy stick died, i went to the 
local dealer and got an hvr-900, which turned out to be really a hvr-900h, 
which is not supported. The message on hauppauge's website is old, and they 
do not have any plans on supporting that stick. Then i took my bike again 
back to the dealer (it started raining...), after 10min. arguing i finally 
could return the stick, and selected the digi vox micro, and didn't get my 
money back, just a coupon...
Next time i'll definitely order via internet again...

greetings,
Roman
