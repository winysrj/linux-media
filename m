This was added on the changeset b3fc1782c8 (see below). A latter changeset (6a108a14fa3)
renamed EMBEDDED to EXPERT.

For embedded systems, it makes more sense to customize the tuners/demods, in order to
remove drivers that would never be used there. That's the rationale behind this patch.

>From my side, I don't mind removing the "default y if EXPERT", but, as I don't usually
work with embedded devices, I don't care much about that. It would be great to hear
some comments from embedded people about that as well.

That's said, it is weird that Mageia is using CONFIG_EXPERT. Are they using those
two Kconfig options enabled as well?

Mauro

commit b3fc1782c8b84574e44cf5869c9afa75523e2db8

    V4L/DVB: V4L: do not autoselect components on embedded systems
    
    Tuner, DVB frontend and video helper chip drivers are by default
    autoselected by their respective host cards, this, however, doesn't make
    much sense on SoC-based systems. Disable autoselection on EMBEDDED
    systems.
