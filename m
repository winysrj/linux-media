Not really, no. I had resigned myself to being unable to attend anything 
like this, so why torture myself with looking in the shop window at what I 
cannot buy?

Without looking again, I expect that you were quite clear.

A very good idea.

Hmmm. That is still not good because classes are in session. But it is not 
nearly so bad in the middle of a semester as it is at the beginning. It is 
even conceivable that I might be able to shake loose some money -- if I 
were either giving a presentation or would (for example) lead a panel 
discussion on this topic. I believe that I would find it easier to be a 
moderator or discussion "leader" than actually to present about a thing 
like this. Namely, I can see the issues but not always the solutions.

Probably, it is not good to apply to my university for money if I merely 
were going to attend; mere intent to attend would probably not get me 
funding for a mathematics conference, either. I also would need enough 
lead time to be able to get things through the bureaucratic system. There 
is some kind of very unreasonable deadline now in effect in the university 
about how soon one needs to apply for foreign travel.

So if you think my presence would have some value, I need something to get 
the application started, over here. Invitation, or something similar. If 
it is too much trouble or would interfere with already-existing plans, 
then never mind. I would hardly be upset if I don't go to something which 
I was not expecting to go to in the first place.
