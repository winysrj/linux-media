Right. At the moment this is very media specific.

Yes. kref would eliminate the need for locks and potential for
unbalanced scenario.

I considered callback for media specific handling to make this token
construct generic. Talked myself out of it with the idea to get this
working for media use-case first and then extend it to be generic.

With this patch set covering media cases including non-media driver,
I think I am confident that the approach itself works to address the
issues and I don't mind pursuing a generic approach you are suggesting.
The current work isn't that far off and I can get the generic working
without many changes.

Thanks again for talking through the problem and ideas.
