If you add something to the videobuf-dma-contig API, that's fine by me
because drivers/media/video/videobuf-dma-contig.c uses the own
structure and plays with dma_alloc_coherent. As long as a driver
doesn't touch device->dma_mem directly, it's fine, I think (that is,
dt3155v4l driver is broken). There are already some workarounds for
contigous memory in several drivers anyway.

We will have the proper API for contiguous memory. I don't think that
adding such workaround to the DMA API is a good idea.
