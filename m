This is what I understood as well. It's cheap switch and LNBs so
that may explain it :)

I don't know how I can measure the current being drained tho. I only
found out that increasing the limit made my setup work.

It may be as well that the isl6423 driver doesnt' set the limit
correctly and configures a lower current limit than what is expected.

Ok I'll work on a patch in that direction. Probably an integer parameter
with multiple possible values allowing to choose the limit or disable
it and add a big fat warning along the way.
