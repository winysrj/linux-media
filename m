Hi Administrator,

I came across your website and wanted to notify you about a broken link on your page in case you weren't aware of it. The link on http://cvs.linuxtv.org/vdrwiki/index.php/Graphtft-plugin which links to http://www.enlightenment.org/pages/imlib2.html is no longer working. I've included a link to a useful page on Photo Album Programs that you could replace the broken link with if you're interested in updating your website. Thanks for providing a great resource!

Best,
Hannah Edwards
