Dear Guennadi

Thank you for some comments.
And I'm sorry about my stupid question.

OK. I will create v7 patch.

After re-send patch,
please teach me which one will be applied.  v6 or v7

Hmm. I was misunderstanding about it.
In v1 patch, you gave me some comments about stop_capture funtion.
So, I added reset method in it.

OK. I think tw9910 can not stop scanning by itself.
It might be possible, but I don't know how to do it.
If I found it, I will send patch. OK ?
In v7 patch, it will do nothing

OK. v7 patch have it.
