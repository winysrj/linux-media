You may be not read all my mails but I really tried to be very positive in them.
I wanted to focus on my Subject, but Mauro has, sometimes, the demand
to focus on insignificant things (like if the code is driver or not). At least
it is my feeling from all those disscussions with him.

I may describe project goal, in few sentences: We have small box, running
embedded linux with 2 satellite tuners on input and ethernet. Nothing more.
We have designed the box for live sat TV/Radio reception, distributing them
down to the network. One of the mode of working is "vtuner", what allows
reuse those tuners remotely on linux desktop. The kernel part is very simple
code exposing kernel's dvb-core to the userspace. Userspace client/server
tools do all resource discovery and connection management. It works
nicely and guys with vdr who is using it are rather satisfied with it.
So, the main
goal of vtuner code is to fully virtualize remote DVB adapter. To any
linux dvb api
compatible applications and tools. The vtuner kernel code seems to be
the simplest and straightforward way to achieve it.

I still think the code is very similar to NBD (Network block device) what sits
in the kernel and is using silently. I guess NBD also do data copying
from/to user space. Is there something what I overlooked?

Can you show me the way (hint please) I can initiate TCP connection
from within kernel space? If I can do it, then the big disadvantage
of data passing to and from kernel can be removed.

I must say that the box is primary focused to the DLNA/UpnP world, so
vtuner feature is something like interesting addon only. But I was myself
very nice surprised how good it behaves on real installations and that
was reason I decided to try to get it included in kernel. I see that
in present there is no willingness for code acceptation, so I will continue
out of the kernel tree.

Anyway, if I can find the way how to start TCP connection from the kernel
part, I understand it can boost throughput very nicely up.
