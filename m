For a DVB driver to work, it is generally required to select 3 drivers:
a bridge driver, a tuner driver and a demodulator driver.

The Kconfig default for DVB_FE_CUSTOMISE is 'n'. So, if no DVB bridge is selected,
nothing will be compiled.

The same bridge driver can be used with several different tuner and demods. 
On almost all cases, the tuner and demod drivers are connected via an I2C bus.

The Kconfig logic was built in a way that, when a bridge driver is selected,
all the drivers that might be required will also be selected.

For example:

config DVB_USB_DIB0700
	tristate "DiBcom DiB0700 USB DVB devices (see help for supported devices)"
	depends on DVB_USB
	select DVB_DIB7000P if !DVB_FE_CUSTOMISE
	select DVB_DIB7000M if !DVB_FE_CUSTOMISE
	select DVB_DIB8000 if !DVB_FE_CUSTOMISE
	select DVB_DIB3000MC if !DVB_FE_CUSTOMISE
	select DVB_S5H1411 if !DVB_FE_CUSTOMISE
	select DVB_LGDT3305 if !DVB_FE_CUSTOMISE
	select DVB_TUNER_DIB0070 if !DVB_FE_CUSTOMISE
	select DVB_TUNER_DIB0090 if !DVB_FE_CUSTOMISE
	select MEDIA_TUNER_MT2060 if !MEDIA_TUNER_CUSTOMISE
	select MEDIA_TUNER_MT2266 if !MEDIA_TUNER_CUSTOMISE
	select MEDIA_TUNER_XC2028 if !MEDIA_TUNER_CUSTOMISE
	select MEDIA_TUNER_XC5000 if !MEDIA_TUNER_CUSTOMISE
	select MEDIA_TUNER_XC4000 if !MEDIA_TUNER_CUSTOMISE
	select MEDIA_TUNER_MXL5007T if !MEDIA_TUNER_CUSTOMISE

This driver supports 82 different types of devices. When this driver is selected, 
all supported variants of tuners and frontends are selected, meaning that any of the 
82 types will work.

Keeping DVB_FE_CUSTOMISE not set is the recommended way, as the options 
DVB_FE_CUSTOMISE and MEDIA_TUNER_CUSTOMISE are there only to allow
advanced users to disable the devices that aren't needed.

For example, one of the ISDB-T devices I have here requires only those drivers
to work:
	DVB_USB_DIB0700		- USB bridge and I2C controller
	DVB_DIB8000		- ISDB-T demodulator
	DVB_TUNER_DIB0070 	- the PLL tuner driver

If just DVB_USB_DIB0700 is selected, the bridge driver will be loaded, 
but no DVB devices will appear, as the driver won't initialize properly.

On the other hand, if those tree modules are selected, the remaining tuners/demods
can be disabled, as the bridge driver won't require them.

So, this is an option that it is useful for embedded systems, where
there's just one specific hardware model to be used.

So, in order to avoid non embedded/advanced users that might enable DVB_FE_CUSTOMISE
by mistake to generate lots of not-a-bug bugzillas, when the DVB customise options
are enabled, all I2C modules are selected by default, using the "default m if DVB_FE_CUSTOMISE"
logic.

So, I think that, in this specific case, the "default m if DVB_FE_CUSTOMISE"
makes sense.

Regards,
Mauro
