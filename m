Hi everybody,

i just got my hands on the above card, its an usb dvb-s2 device with an
ci-slot.
The Product page is here :
http://www.technisat.com/indexdb3d.html?nav=PC_products,en,76-228

It is currently not detectd by the v4l drivers, neither by the tree from
linuxtv, nor by the s2-liplianin nor the
multirpoto tree. It is however listed in this post:
http://marc.info/?l=linux-dvb&m=122143814507358&w=2
as supported by the multiproto-tree. However i cant get it to work. What
is needed / what should i do to make
 it work ? Note that i tried the multiproto-tree and also the
s2-liplianin -ree.

Thank you for your help

Jan Kreuzer
