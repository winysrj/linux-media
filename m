I don't think it's a beter way for you to study USB Audio Device Class
driver unless you're interested in ALSA or USB subsystem.

(But for your information, snd-usb-audio is in sound/usb/* of Linux
kernel. IEC 61883-1/6 driver is in sound/firewire/*.)

We need different strategy to achieve it on different transmission backen=
d.

> Knowing where to start looking is a tremendous help

It's not well-documented, and not well-generalized for packet-oriented
drivers. Most of developers who have enough knowledge about it work for
DMA-oriented drivers in mobile platforms and have little interests in
packet-oriented drivers. You need to find your own way.

Currently I have few advices to you, because I'm also on the way for
drivers to process IEC 61883-1/6 packets on IEEE 1394 bus with enough
accuracy and granularity. The paper I introduced is for the way (but not
mature).

I wish you get more helps from the other developers. Your work is more
significant to Linux system, than mine.

(And I hope your future work get no ignorance and no unreasonable
hostility from coarse users.)
