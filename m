Feel free to merge this. It makes a broken driver slightly less broken.

I don't know when I will have time to create a proper patch that fixes this
driver. I need to get the work I'm doing on the control framework done first,
and that is taking a lot longer than I would like. But there is no sense in
keeping this patch back.

While working on the control framework I found a few bugs. I'll try to make
a pull request fixing them today or tomorrow at the latest.

Regards,

	Hans
