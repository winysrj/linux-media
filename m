I'm not sure. Recently I tried to refresh my now 7 months old patch in 
which I used that 'memblock_remove() then dma_declare_coherent_memery()' 
method[1]. It was different from your S5P MFC example in that it didn't 
punch any holes in the system memory, only stole a block of SDRAM from 
its tail. But Russell reminded me again: "we should not be mapping SDRAM 
using device mappings."[2]. Would defining ARCH_HAS_HOLES_MEMORYMODEL 
(even if it was justified) make any diference in my case? I don't think 
so. Wnat I think, after Russell, is that we still need that obligatory 
ioremap() removed from dma_declare_coherent_memory(), or made it 
optional, or a separate dma_declare_coherent_memory()-like function 
without (obligatory) ioremap() provided by the DMA API, in order to get 
the dma_declare_coherent_memery() method being accepted without any 
reservations when used inside arch/arm, I'm afraid.

Thanks,
Janusz
