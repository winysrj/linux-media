The et61x251 wants to manage all etoms webcams, but only the 102c:6251
is handled (sensor tas5130d1b - the 102c:6151 contains a pas106).
The other USB ID's should be removed from this driver.

About sn9c102, some people say that the sn9c102 is working better than
gspca. Also, both drivers et61x251 and sn9c102 support cropping while
gspca does not.

Regards.
