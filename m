I've been trying to get an ASUS PVR-416 card to work with MythTV .25 on 
Scientific Linux 6.  I have a bttv card working, my setup works in 
general, etc, and the driver attempts to load.  But when I check dmesg, 
I keep getting firmware load errors and checksum errors. I've tried 
every firmware I could find.  I've used the one from Atrpms, I've 
downloaded the correctly named firmware from ivtv, but no luck.  Anyone 
know anything about this card?  I've tried cutting the drivers myself 
like it says in the direcitons at mythtv.org. This is supposed to be a 
supported card, does anyone have any experience with it?
