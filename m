Hi all,

I've been working for a while with an iMX25PDK using the BSP provided by
Freescale (L2.6.31). The camera driver (V4L2-int) and examples do the
job quite well but I need to move my design to a more recent kernel.
I've been extensively googling but haven't found any info/examples about
how to run the mx2_camera driver in the i.MX25PDK. I'm stuck at this,
could someone point me in the right direction? Thank you in advance...

Best regards,
Gonzalo
