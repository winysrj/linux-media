Q3? Frankly that sort of a delay sounds like they are writing new drivers that 
WON'T be gpl'd.  Complying with the gpl is, if the lawyers stay the hell out of 
it, at best a days work.  All they have to do is make sure the licenses are 
still there, if not put them back in and put them in a package & hand the 
location of the package to their webmaster to add it as a download on their web 
page.  I could be wrong, but to me Q3 is a smoke screen while they do their 
best to make non-gpl drivers. The FSF needs to get a settlement at the least.
