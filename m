Sure, we will definitely do this.

I guess you're talking about 44ecf1df9493e6684cd1bb34abb107a0ffe1078a,
which ensures a 10ms msleep call. We don't have this patch, but as with
CONFIG_HZ=100, msleep() calls are anyway rounded up to 10ms, so I'm not
sure this patch will have a huge impact. But we will try.

Then, there is also de99d5328c6d54694471da28711a05adec708c3b, but it
doesn't seem to be related to our problem. But we will also try with
that one.

 :-)

Thanks for your very quick feedback!
