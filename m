Hi Mauro,

Thanks for the patch!

I've done some quick testing on stk1160+saa7113 and also stk1160+gm7113c,
everything looks OK (except from the minor misname comment, see the patch 2/2).

Let me do some more testing just to be sure.

@Jon: Do you mind sending the standard fix for gm7113c? We need those
to make stk1160+gm7113c work. I'll put my Tested-by so we can merge it!

FWIW, some user reported he didn't need those quirks to capture a PAL (?)
source. But in my experience, I *do* need them, otherwise I get a noisy
PAL-Nc output and no video capture at all on NTSC/PAL-M.

Thanks a lot for the good work!
