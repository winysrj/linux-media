I've been looking for the same thing for a while, and haven't found
anything.  I was planning on buying the Technotrend S-1500 (PCI card)
which appears to be fairly well supported.

I think someone else has said it, but all freesat broadcasts are currently
DVB-S only.  I can currently get BBCHD and ITVHD using the DVB-S part of
my HVR-3000 (Analog + DVB-T + DVB-S hybrid card)

I think that DVB-S2 support in Linux is still fairly new, and not
officially supported by (m)any apps (VDR or MythTv)

Robert.
