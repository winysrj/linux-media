Yes, it's weird.

So I followed Oleksij's adviced and reverted the following commit groups:
 - 66847ef [media] uvcvideo: Add UVC timestamps support, 3afedb9 [media]
   uvcvideo: Don't skip erroneous payloads and ed0ee0c [media] uvcvideo:
   Fix race-related crash in uvc_video_clock_update()
 - ab86e9e [media] uvcvideo: Allow userptr IO mode and 6998b6f [media]
   uvcvideo: Use videobuf2-vmalloc
 - 3d95e93 [media] uvcvideo: Move fields from uvc_buffer::buf to
   uvc_buffer
 - c4d99f8 [media] uvcvideo: Ignore GET_RES error for XU controls
 - 806e23e [media] uvcvideo: Fix integer overflow in uvc_ioctl_ctrl_map()
 - d0d9748 [media] uvcvideo: Use kcalloc instead of kzalloc to allocate
   array
None of this fixed the issue.

So I just decided to revert the whole uvc driver: git checkout v3.2 --
drivers/media/video/uvc.
But, the problem was still here.

I reverted the usb host code in drivers/usb/host/. Again the problem was
reproduced (both with and without 3.2's uvcvideo driver)

Then I tested the whole kernel v3.2, and indeed it still works very well.

So this problem could have it's root in USB core changes, or even a
combilation of USB and UVC changes.

I don't think that's it. As I've said, problem exists with both 3.3.3 and
Linus' 3.4-rc5.
