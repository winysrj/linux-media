But also, the simpler is the topology and the simpler should be its
description.

In your approach, the connections between endpoints are described in
the components themselves, which makes hard for the DT maintainers to
have a global understanding of the video subsystem.

Having the topology described in the master device is clearer, even if
it is complex.

The tda998x chips are simple enough for being used in many boards: one
video input and one serial digital output. I don't see in which
circumstance the driver should be rewritten.

I don't think that the display controllers or the encoders have to know
about the topology. They have well-knwon specific functions and the way
they are interconnected should not impact these functions. If that
would be the case, they should offer a particular configuration
interface to the master driver.

Your OF graph proposal is rather complex, and it does not even indicate
which way the data flows.

I don't like this 'helper' notion. See below.

I don't see why the encoders and connectors should be created by some
external entity. They are declared in the DT or created by the board
init, so, they exist at system startup time.

In fact, I wonder why there is not only one DRM driver. The global
logic is always the same, and, actually, it is duplicated in each
specific driver. I had this approach in the gspca driver: one main
driver and many specific subdrivers. Once, I even had the idea to
convert your UVC driver into a gspca subdriver, but, at this time, I
had too much work with the other webcams. Nevertheless, it would have
been easy: all the required interfaces were (are still) present in the
main gspca driver.

In the same order of idea, there is only one ALSA SoC driver, and you
cannot say that the audio topology is less complex than the video one.

When thinking about the unique DRM driver, there would no helper anymore:
the driver would offer to each component the functions they need for
working correctly.

Sorry, but I think that a DRM encoder is the hardware encoder. What
else could it be? At initialization time, the master driver has only to
manage the relation between the video components. It has not to create
entities which already exist. So my preferred scheme is:

- at starting time, each video component initializes its software and
  hardware, and then, plugs itself into the DRM driver.

- from the central video topology, the DRM device waits for all
  components to be plugged and then it links the components together,
  creating the user's view of the system.

If you create the encoders and connectors in the DRM master, the
hardware encoder and connector devices are just like zombies. They must
put something in the system to say they are here and they must also
have a callback function for them to know to which video subsystem they
belong.

On the contrary, if the DRM encoders and connectors are created by the
hardware devices, they are immediately alive and operational.
