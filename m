Subject: [RFC PATCH 00/12] Ion cleanup in preparation for moving out of staging
Date: Thu,  2 Mar 2017 13:44:32 -0800

Hi,

There's been some recent discussions[1] about Ion-like frameworks. There's
apparently interest in just keeping Ion since it works reasonablly well.
This series does what should be the final clean ups for it to possibly be
moved out of staging.

This includes the following:
- Some general clean up and removal of features that never got a lot of use
  as far as I can tell.
- Fixing up the caching. This is the series I proposed back in December[2]
  but never heard any feedback on. It will certainly break existing
  applications that rely on the implicit caching. I'd rather make an effort
  to move to a model that isn't going directly against the establishement
  though.
- Fixing up the platform support. The devicetree approach was never well
  recieved by DT maintainers. The proposal here is to think of Ion less as
  specifying requirements and more of a framework for exposing memory to
  userspace.
- CMA allocations now happen without the need of a dummy device structure.
  This fixes a bunch of the reasons why I attempted to add devicetree
  support before.

I've had problems getting feedback in the past so if I don't hear any major
objections I'm going to send out with the RFC dropped to be picked up.
The only reason there isn't a patch to come out of staging is to discuss any
other changes to the ABI people might want. Once this comes out of staging,
I really don't want to mess with the ABI.

Feedback appreciated.

Thanks,
Laura
