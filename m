Does anyone know if the current Technotrend DVB-S2 S2-3200 with the CI 
daughter board supports the latest generation of CI+ CAMS and specified 
in http://www.ci-plus.com/ in non-legacy mode? I guess what I am asking 
is, can the hardware support full CI+, what would be involved software 
wise and has anyone looked at this?

Pete
