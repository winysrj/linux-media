Hello Devin,
I have an Empire Media Pen Dual TV and it has same layout as Kworld dvb-t 310u.
while MSI Digivox A/D has "similar" layout and supports 1080i extra resolution,
as http://www.msi.com/index.php?func=proddesc&maincat_no=132&prod_no=626

If you want I can capture usb device startup log using Usbsnoop/SniffUSB  ...
Giuseppe
