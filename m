> Josh, for the two comments by Guennadi above, you can take sound/soc/atmel/sam9g20_wm8731.c as an example of using PCK and parent clocks. You will also find how to use named clocks and how to set the programmable clocks rate...

According to sam9g20_wm8731.c file, and combined Guennadi and J.C's advices, I'd like to only add clk_set_rate() and enable/disble isi_mck code in ISI driver. 
Also I will define isi_mck clock in soc chip file(at91sam9g45.c).
Then I will move all setting up the parent clock code into the at91sam9g45_devices.c, where there are code to add Atmel ISI device.

I will generate the new version patch for it soon.
