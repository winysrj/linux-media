OK, take your suggestion to use frame index, but I still have question
about it, see my question in another thread.

We can let driver to normalize it to user which doesn't care if the range
is 0~11 or 10~21, a uniform range should always make user happy,
shouldn't it?

Looks 1..100 is better, and I will change it to 1..100.

No, they are different. FD_LHIT is used to guild FD HW to detect more
faces but more false positives __or__ less faces but less false positives.

A control class is needed to be introduced for adjusting this value of FD
HW, and I think a normalized range is better too.

As I said above, there is no advantage to export the range to user, and a
uniform range will make user happy.

It is great to hear it, :-)

I think v4l2_obj_detection is better because it can be reused to describe
some other kind of object detection from video in the future.

OK, but may introduce more memory footprint for the fd result.

Sounds good.

Do you have any suggestion about how to describe this kind of
detection?

I think the structure is used to describe one single detection result which
may include several kind of objects detected, so sounds
v4l2_fd_detection is better than v4l2_fd_object(s?).

Why is struct 'v4l2_fd_shape    reserved[4]' removed?

Why is '__packed' needed? It will introduce performance loss if we have
not good reason to do it.
