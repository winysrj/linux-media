Added it while writing the code, to get any coding mistake I make
flagged right away instead of things exploding later on.

I can drop it.

So it simplifies review, ok, will change it.

BTW: Maybe the kernel should pick up a neat trick from glib:

g_new0() is a macro which takes the type instead of the size as first
argument, and it casts the return value to that type.  So the compiler
will throw warnings in case of a mismatch.  That'll work better than
depending purely on the coder being careful and review catching the
remaining issues.
