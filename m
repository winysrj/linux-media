It makes sense to associate a wall time with recorded streams for that 
purpose, but synchronization should in my opinion be performed using the 
monotonic clock, as the wall time can jump around. I believe drivers should 
provide monotonic timestamps only. However, given that the uvcvideo driver has 
the option of providing wall clock timestamps, that option should work, so 
your patch makes sense. I'd still like to remove support for the wall clock 
though, but I don't want to break userspace. ffmpeg should be fixed, 
especially given that most V4L devices provide monotonic timestamps only.
