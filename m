Ok, that's not really nice, but I guess it is needed.

As it's only needed to be looked up at open() time, why not just make it
dynamic?

No, just curious.

But what's to keep that from happening on the next line as well?  That
doesn't seem like a check you can ever be sure about, so I wouldn't do
it at all.

As container_of _ALWAYS_ returns a valid pointer, you can't check it for
NULL.  I don't know, it just doesn't seem correct here, but if you are
sure it's working properly, I'll not push the issue.

Ok.

Again, you can't check for NULL as the result of container_of() that
does not work (hint, container_of() is just pointer math, without ever
looking at the original pointer value.)

I don't really know, all I know is that cdev is a difficult thing to
handle at times, but not everyone who uses it needs a struct device.
But some people do (as this code shows), so I guess it needs to be a
whole new structure/interface that binds the two together like you just
did.  I think that would be good for a lot more places other than just
the media subsystem, so it should go into the core kernel instead.
