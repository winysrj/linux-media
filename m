The ALSA API supports a generic .get_time_info callback, its 
implementation is for now limited to a regular 'DMA' or 'link' timestamp 
for HDaudio - the difference being which counters are used and how close 
they are to the link serializer. The synchronized part is still WIP but 
should come 'soon'

You can experiment with the 'dma' and 'link' timestamps today on any 
HDaudio-based device. Like I said the synchronized part has not been 
upstreamed yet (delays + dependency on ART-to-TSC conversions that made 
it in the kernel recently)
