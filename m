Dear Friend,

                  Please acknowledge and accept my proposal.

My name is Barrister Miguel Martinez Moreno, an Attorney at Law, in 
Alicante-Spain.

I am writing to notify you of the unclaimed inheritance deposit of our 
late client, who passed on to Great beyond on August 21st, 2010 in a 
motor accident in auto pista de Alcala Del Henares, Madrid-Spain.

I got your name and email address through a web search engine in my 
quest to get a reliable individual who shall work with me in claiming 
this inheritance deposit since all my efforts to get the biological 
relative has proved abortive.

Conclusively, I await your urgent response to include the following :( 
1).Your full Names & Address. (2).Your Telephone and Fax numbers. 
(3).Your business name if any: for more information on how to release 
the inheritance deposit, amount, procedure and legality of this claim 
send me an email via: gva_abogados@aim.com

Have a very nice day my friend!

Regards,
Miguel Martinez Moreno (Esq)
Attorney At Law.
