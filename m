Hi Simon,

The FX2 is a processor, and, in ov519, used as a bridge, it has been
programmed by OmniVision for their sensors. It is quite sure that its
firmware is different in your webcam.

To know more, you should examine USB traces done with some other driver
(ms-windows - the scripts I use to translate these traces for gspca are
in my web site)...
