I have a macro of_phy_provider_register/devm_of_phy_provider_register that
calls these functions and should be used by the PHY drivers. Probably I should
make a mention of it in the Documentation.

ok.

hmm.. some PHY drivers use the id they provide to perform some of their
internal operation as in [1] (This is used only if a single PHY provider
implements multiple PHYS). Probably I'll add an option like PLATFORM_DEVID_AUTO
to give the PHY drivers an option to use auto id.

hmm.. there might be cases where the same controller in one soc needs PHY
control and in some other soc does not need PHY control. In such cases, we
might get error pointer here.
I'll change WARN to dev_err.

Alright.
