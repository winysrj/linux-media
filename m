I don't have much in the way of DVB-expertise, but here goes :
1) WinTV-CI doesn't participate in getting the signal, so changes in tuners/modulation standards/... etc shouldn't bother it
2) It is a USB2-device so should have the raw bandwidth to handle a HDTV stream
3) It uses the smartcard you'd use normally, so the actual decryption is done with the same hardware

so I'd venture it's a software limitation.
