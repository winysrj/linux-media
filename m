Actually it does.

That would not be possible given architectures use GFP_DMA for other
things and there are plenty of legacy x86 drivers which still need to be
around. So the focus from mm folks shifted to letting x86 folks map
GFP_DMA onto the CMA pool. Long term, this is nothing that driver developers
need to care for, but just knowing internally behind the scenes there is some
cleaning up being done in terms of architecture.

This is actually the part that is x86 specific.

Each other architecture may use it for some other definition and it seems
some architectures use GFP_DMA all over the place. So the topic really should
be about x86.

Right, how the flag is used on other architectures varies, so in fact the
focus for cleaning up for now should be an x86 effort. Whether or not
other architectures do something silly with GFP_DMA is beyond the scope
of what was discussed.
