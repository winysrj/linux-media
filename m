I think this sets a bad precedent, these drivers work fine. Removing
BKL from them is hard, and involves finding and booting hw that
developers don't have much time/interest in at the moment. Anyone who
has access to the i810 hw and has time to work out the locking has
more important things to be doing with modern hw, however it doesn't
mean we should just drop support for old drivers because they don't
have active maintainers. Removing the BKL from the kernel is a great
goal, but breaking userspace ABI by removing drivers isn't.

Dave.
