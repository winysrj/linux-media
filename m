Hi to all,
I've discovered thet mine dikom dk-300 usb device has a weird behaviour.
If I connect it to the pc it works well both in digital and analogue 
mode, but after some time it is connected, without being in use, the 
analogue sound stops to work. The only way to have it working again is 
to unplug and replug the device.
I wonder if there is a command to reinitialize without the need to 
phisically unplug and replug it.
Thank you,
Andrea
