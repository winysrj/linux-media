Hi,

can anyone tell me something about the current status of the Terratec Cinergy HTC USB XS HD (0ccd:008e)?
AFAIK it consists of an empia EM2884 chip, which seem to be not a big problem to handle, and then there's the micronas DRX 3926KA1, which is the heart of the device. (http://www.linuxtv.org/pipermail/linux-dvb/2008-July/027276.html).

Now there's this statement:
"Linux support for Micronas hardware is very difficult because Micronas seem unwilling to release documentation for their hardware." (http://www.quantexzone.com/guides/mic_ngene.htm)
But i wonder if this may have changed as it's not really a micronas chip anymore:
http://www.micronas.com/investor/investornewsadhocpublicity/articles/PR0903/index.html?newslang=1

So maybe it gets easier to ask for information here? http://www.tridentmicro.com/Product_drx_39xyK.asp

Meanwhile, I'm waiting for more than a year for linux support of this IMHO very attractive hardware, but though Terratec announced a linux driver more than half a year ago, now they don't answer on questions about it's status. This is really a nuisance!! This device seems to be totally hushed up from  several sides within the last months, but there are many users who would like to use it under linux and who are puzzling about whats going on at the moment.

Of course I'm willing to provide help, i.e. for beta testing on x86 and amd64 hardware or if there's anything else to get some advancements.

Thanks,

Raimund
