Since conf.py is python, we could implement something, which loads a
"conditional configuration", e.g. loading a config with a nitpick_ignore
list in. Depending on an environment 

 "SPHINX_BUILD_CONF=[strong|lazy]-nit-picking.py"

we could load individual build-configs overwriting the default settings
from the origin conf.py.

On which repo/branch you are working? .. I send you a RFC patch 
for "conditional configurations".

Back to (3) ... as far as I know, there is no way to add a 
*Internal Hyperlink Target* (e.g. "_v4l2-field:") to the C or 
CPP domain.

There is a ":any:" directive does something vice versa.

http://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/stable/markup/inline.html#role-any

But I think, this will not help referencing a type from a function
prototype to a *Internal Hyperlink Target*, like the struct described
under the "_v4l2-field:" target.

If ":any:" does not help, we might find a solution with an additional
crossref-type or something similar:

http://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/stable/extdev/appapi.html#sphinx.application.Sphinx.add_crossref_type

But this needs some more thoughts.
