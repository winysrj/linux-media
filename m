Uhm, that doesn't make sense.
Why do you want to call it audio_ifnum although it is used for 
audio/video/dvb ???

We already to that: dev->alt.

I think there is some general misunderstanding here.
There is always only a single interface number and current alternate 
setting per driver instance.
If all endpoints are on the same interface, there's only a sibgle driver 
instance.
If the audio endpoints are on a separate interface, there will be two 
driver instances (each of them using their own device struct etc.).

alt=7 is actually bug that needs to be fixed.
It messes up the alt settings made by the video part.
This just didn't show up so far, because the video stream is almost 
always started after the audio stream.

Do you know any devices with audio endpoints 0x83 on the same interface 
as video/dvb ?
If yes, can you check their alt settings ? I'm pretty sure the audio 
endpoint uses the same wMaxPacketSize and bInterval values at all alt 
settings.
Otherwise things would become very complicated...

No. Audio and video are on the same interface.
If they are on separate interfaces, there will be be two driver 
instances running, each of them handling their own interface settings 
(interface number and used alt setting).
