Ok. Thanks for noticing it.

Do you think that 'unsigned long' for offset is too big?

Ad n_pages. Assuming that Moore's law holds it will take
circa 25 years before the limit of 16 TB is reached :) for
high-end scatterlist operations.
Or I can change the type of n_pages to 'unsigned long' now at
no cost :).

The problem is that 'i' is  a natural name for a loop counter.
This exactly how 'i' is used in this function.
The type 'int' was used in the initial version of the code.
It was changed to avoid 'unsigned vs signed' comparisons in
the loop condition.

AFAIK, in the kernel code developers try to avoid Hungarian notation.
A name of a variable should reflect its purpose, not its type.
I can change the name of 'i' to 'pageno' and 'j' to 'pageno2' (?)
but I think it will make the code less reliable.

This is a very good questions. I did some research and I had looked
for all pfn_to_phys implementations in the kernel code. I found
that all conversions are performed by bit shifting. Therefore
I expect that assumption that contiguous PFNs imply contiguous physical
addresses is true for all architectures supported by Linux kernel.

Please refer to 'i'-arguments above.
