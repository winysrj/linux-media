DVB-T2 demodulator prototype to enable next HDTV broadcast revolution 

Eindhoven, Netherlands - September 10, 2008 - NXP Semiconductors, the independent company founded by Philips, will unveil a demonstration of an end-to-end DVB-T2 technology-based transmission at the IBC 2008 conference in Amsterdam. The demonstration features NXP's silicon tuner TDA18211HN and one of the first prototypes of NXP's DVB-T2 demodulator TDA10055 - which will complete NXP's wide range of front-end products for digital TV reception. 

Building on the success of NXP's DVB-T receivers, the new demodulator's unique architecture will enable all the benefits of DVB-T2, the most advanced digital terrestrial TV system, to be delivered to tomorrow's living rooms. NXP developed its DVB-T2 demonstration at IBC in close collaboration with ENENSYS and Pace plc. 

"DVB-T2 will be the next edge of the TV revolution in our living room, providing the most efficient and robust way to bring HDTV to end consumers over terrestrial networks. NXP, building on its leadership in DVB-T silicon tuners and demodulators, is proud to demonstrate the first prototype of its DVB-T2 solution," said Christos Lagomichos, executive vice president and general manager of the Home business unit at NXP Semiconductors. "Leaps in technology innovation are made possible when companies can combine their expertise, and we are particularly happy to have joined forces for this new challenge with ENENSYS and Pace." 

To appeal to end consumers, broadcasters are due to propose attractive new services, including a much larger array of High-Definition channels, which take advantage of the high capacity and reliability of the DVB-T2 digital terrestrial transmission system. Because of the high bandwidth consumed by these services, there is a strong need for highly efficient transmission techniques. DVB-T2 is the ideal solution, offering an unsurpassed level of signal robustness and bandwidth, while still complying with the existing antenna infrastructure. As the analog terrestrial switch-off releases some spectrum, it creates an opportunity to introduce services based on this new technology. 

The end-to-end DVB-T2 transmission demonstrated at IBC 2008 is made possible through close collaboration between NXP, ENENSYS and Pace. The demo will showcase NXP's complete front-end based on the digital terrestrial silicon tuner, TDA18211HN, and a prototype of its forthcoming DVB-T2 demodulator TDA10055; ENENSYS' DVB-T2 modulator prototype; and a complete video back-end from Pace, featuring its high-definition set-top box, the DTR5000.
