Ok Mauro, Do you think I would capable to add the USB ID at cx231xx
driver in order to make it work? Where from can I gownload the cx231xx
in order I can try to introduce the line (I guess...) in the file of
ths e cx231xx driver and after that to compile it with "make" and them
do "make install" to incorporate it in my kernel (2.6.38-8-generic).
Is it correct this proceeding I said?  I am not sure how to do this
things... I think that I must have the kernel source of
2.6.38-8-generic version in the /usr/src/linux-2.6.38-8-generic
directory, is it correct? Can you indi cate a site or tutorial that I
could do the insersion of the USB ID (1554:5019) in the cx231xx driver
and compile it and to add it in the module in Ubuntu 11.04?
By the way Mauro, couldn't I write in Portuguese to you? Ok, just in
case I send the message only for you, not to linux-media list.

Thanks in advance

Antonio Carlos
