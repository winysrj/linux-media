Yes, exactly.  locked == NULL should be avoided whenever mmap_sem can 
be dropped, and the comment indirectly said so.  Now most of those cases
actually are those where you can just call get_user_pages_unlocked.

Or not widely necessary. :)

This is only true if someone does the work though.  From a quick look 
at your series, the following files can be trivially changed to use 
get_user_pages_unlocked:

- drivers/gpu/drm/via/via_dmablit.c
- drivers/platform/goldfish/goldfish_pipe.c
- drivers/staging/vc04_services/interface/vchiq_arm/vchiq_arm.c
- drivers/rapidio/devices/rio_mport_cdev.c
- drivers/virt/fsl_hypervisor.c

Also, videobuf_dma_init_user could be changed to use retry by adding a 
*locked argument to videobuf_dma_init_user_locked, prototype patch 
after my signature.

Everything else is probably best kept using get_user_pages.

But then get_user_pages_locked remains a less-common case, so perhaps 
it's a good thing to give it a longer name!

Adding the 'vmas' parameter to get_user_pages_locked would make little 
sense.  Since VM_FAULT_RETRY invalidates it and g_u_p_locked can and 
does retry, it would generally not be useful.

So I think we have the right API now:

- do not have lock?  Use get_user_pages_unlocked, get retry for free,
no need to handle  mmap_sem and the locked argument; cannot get back vmas.

- have and cannot drop lock?  User get_user_pages, no need to pass NULL 
for the locked argument; can get back vmas.

- have but can drop lock (rare case)?  Use get_user_pages_locked, 
cannot get back vams.
