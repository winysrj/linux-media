Hey everybody,

I have been searching for information on using compact photo cameras
as video devices (and also for compatibility with gphoto through the
gphoto websites/mailing list).

I was wondering if any of you knows which cameras (brand, type) I
should focus on?  I'm interested in digital compact camera that can be
used to take decent quality pictures, and also function as for
instance a web cam for applications such as Ekiga.  I am unable to
find any lists of cameras that are supported.

By the way, I am much more an end-user then a developer, so forgive me
if I ask dumb questions, or if I ask questions that are outside of the
scope of this mailing list.

Thanks in advance!

Robin
