Someone please tell me when it's time to start paying attention
again ;)

These patches don't seem to have as many acked-bys and reviewed-bys as
I'd expect.  Given the scope and duration of this, it would be useful
to gather these up.  But please ensure they are real ones - people
sometimes like to ack things without showing much sign of having
actually read them.

Also there is the supreme tag: "Tested-by:.".  Ohad (at least) has been
testing the code.  Let's mention that.


The patches do seem to have been going round in ever-decreasing circles
lately and I think we have decided to merge them (yes?) so we may as well
get on and do that and sort out remaining issues in-tree.
