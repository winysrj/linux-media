Yes, and the problem is that the maintainer (Mauro) tends to look at this
close to the merge window, generally leaving you with very little time to
make adjustments.

In all honesty, in this particular case the pull request came in late
because other reviewers asked TI to move the driver to staging because we
thought the driver wasn't quite ready yet.

If it would just be merged as a staging driver, then it would most likely
be sitting in linux-next by now since a few days, well in time for the merge
window. Instead we are having this whole discussion :-(

I sincerely hope so. Of course, since I'm going to be one of the sub-maintainers
I'm going to see this from the other side as well, so I might get the same
critisism in the future :-)

Well, it would work if you can rely on patches being reviewed and merged
in a timely manner. Hopefully that will happen when the sub-maintainers
can start next year. It should make everything more predictable.
