Ok, I make that assumption going by the discussion about link direction
that ensued.

Yes.

False positives would just take up a bit of space in the endpoint lists,
but otherwise should be no problem, as they would only be used when
either a driver implementing the bindings is bound, or when they are
connected to other endpoints. Whether or not we scan the whole tree,
using this heuristic, is more a matter of principle.

Thank you. Can everybody live with this?
