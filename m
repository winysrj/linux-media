I prefer 1. over 2.

My gut feeling is that we should have separate properties for the video sync 
type and the synchronization signals polarities. We could have a chip that 
supports sync-on-green on the analog (input) side and outputs separate hsync 
and vsync signals only on the digital (output) side. There would be no sync-
on-green polarity in that case.
