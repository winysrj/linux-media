I'm not an expert in the regulator framework, but I'd think that one
should be able to assume a regulator is in a sane state after boot. The
fact that the regulator is enabled when it has no users should likely be
fixed in the boot loader. Is that an option?

Does the problem exist in other boards beyond N900?

Another alternative to the first option you proposed could be to add a
flags field to regulator_consumer_supply, and use a flag to recognise
regulators which need to be disabled during initialisation. The flag
could be set by using a new macro e.g. REGULATOR_SUPPLY_NASTY() when
defining the regulator.

Just my 0,05 euros. ;-)
