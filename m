So I'm not convinced that this patch improves things; it moves a tiny bit
of code into another file where anybody reading the driver will have to
go look to see what's going on.  But I guess it doesn't really make
things worse either; I won't try to stand in its way.  It would be nice
to see a real changelog on the patch, though.
