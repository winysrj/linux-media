No, don't do that. The current standard must always be a valid non-0 standard. Ditto for
dv_timings for that matter. If it doesn't match with the actual detected signal then
ENUM_INPUT will set the corresponding error flag in struct v4l2_input.

All applications assume that g_std and g_dv_timings return valid values and they rely
on QUERYSTD and QUERY_DV_TIMINGS to obtain the detected std/timings.

No, don't. It's not the way it works.

No, you have to initialize this with a valid standard, and traditionally
this is NTSC_M. This also implies that the initial format is 720x480
to correspond with this standard.

I hate this extra else because it implies that there is a way that the 'if' part
can bypass the return and continue after the else. It's obvious in this case that
that can't happen, but in more complex code this isn't clear at all.

Yes. Interlaced is tricky, so in general it should only be enabled if you have
actually tested it. The chances of doing this right without testing are pretty
slim in my experience.

Not a hotplug event, it's a receiver, so it sets the hotplug itself. This tests for
the 5V pin to become high when a source is connected. Sort of the inverse of the
hotplug pin.

And yes, userspace wants/needs to know this.
