As already announced, we're continuing the planning for this year's 
media subsystem workshop.

To avoid overriding the main ML with workshop-specifics, a new ML
was created:
	workshop-2011@linuxtv.org

I'll also be updating the event page at:
	http://www.linuxtv.org/events.php

Over the one-year period, we had 242 developers contributing to the
subsystem. Thank you all for that! Unfortunately, the space there is
limited, and we can't affort to have all developers there. 

Due to that some criteria needed to be applied to create a short list
of people that were invited today to participate. 

The main criteria were to select the developers that did significant 
contributions for the media subsystem over the last 1 year period, 
measured in terms of number of commits and changed lines to the kernel
drivers/media tree.

As the used criteria were the number of kernel patches, userspace-only 
developers weren't included on the invitations. It would be great to 
have there open source application developers as well, in order to allow 
us to tune what's needed from applications point of view. 

So, if you're leading the development of some V4L and/or DVB open-source 
application and wants to be there, or you think you can give good 
contributions for helping to improve the subsystem, please feel free 
to send us an email.

With regards to the themes, we're received, up to now, the following 
proposals:

---------------------------------------------------------+----------------------
THEME                                                    | Proposed-by:
---------------------------------------------------------+----------------------
Buffer management: snapshot mode                         | Guennadi
Rotation in webcams in tablets while streaming is active | Hans de Goede
V4L2 Spec â€“ ambiguities fix                              | Hans Verkuil
V4L2 compliance test results                             | Hans Verkuil
Media Controller presentation (probably for Wed, 25)     | Laurent Pinchart
Workshop summary presentation on Wed, 25                 | Mauro Carvalho Chehab
---------------------------------------------------------+----------------------

>From my side, I also have the following proposals:

1) DVB API consistency - what to do with the audio and video DVB API's 
that conflict with V4L2 and (somewhat) with ALSA?

2) Multi FE support - How should we handle a frontend with multiple 
delivery systems like DRX-K frontend?

3) videobuf2 - migration plans for legacy drivers

4) NEC IR decoding - how should we handle 32, 24, and 16 bit protocol
variations?

Even if you won't be there, please feel free to propose themes for 
discussion, in order to help us to improve even more the subsystem.

Thank you!
Mauro
