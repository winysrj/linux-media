Hi Hans,

Thank you for your review

Sure :)

I'm not sure to undestand this point. I "grepped" for the adv7180 and it 
seem that I'm the only user of the adv7180 (sta2x11 VIP driver). In the
VIP driver I don't use the control framework (there aren't controls), so 
I think these lines must be there. Am I wrong?

I think you are thinking at the "Inheriting Controls" section of the 
v4l2-controls.txt document. Right?
