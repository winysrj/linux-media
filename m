I am using the MT9M131 with an i.MX35 board and Linux 3.4.5. It works nicely. I
have not noticed 1 and 3. However, I have noticed 2, for which I already have
posted a patch (here: https://patchwork.kernel.org/patch/2187291/), but I have
not yet received any feedback.

It's not straightforward to port my board to 3.8, but I've just reviewed the
code in linux-next (see below).

This hunk does the same thing as my patch mentioned above, so please don't send
anything for that.

There is indeed a bug, introduced by commit 4bbc6d5. The issue is:
 mt9m111_set_context(mt9m111, mt9m111->ctx);
in mt9m111_restore_state() called (indirectly) from mt9m111_s_power() from
mt9m111_video_probe() with ctx still NULL, before mt9m111_init() has been called
to initialize ctx to &context_b.

So the fix would not be what you did, but rather to reorganize things a little
bit to avoid this out-of-order init and use of ctx.

Best regards,
Beno√Æt
