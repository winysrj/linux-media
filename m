Hi,

Sorry for the slow response ...

No what I was trying to say is that the balance controls are for hardware
which actually has balance controls and not per color gains (such as the
bt87x chips), but they are being abused by many drivers to add support for
per color gains. And then you miss one control. And in the case of the pac7302
driver the "original" route was taken of using whitebalance to control
the green gain. Which is wrong IMHO, but it is what the driver does know.

A proper fix would be to introduce new controls for all 3 gains, and use
those instead of using the balance controls + adding a 3th balance control
being discussed in the thread titled:
"Gain controls in v4l2-ctrl framework".

I see in your next mail that you've changed your mind. So I would like to
move forward with this by adding your 2 patches + 1 more patch to also
make the whitebalance control (which really is the green gain control)
use 0x02 rather then 0xc6. To do this we must make sure that 0xc6 has
a proper fixed / default setting. So what does the windows driver use
for this? 1 like with 0xc5 and 0xc7 ?

And can you do a 3th patch to make the whitebalance control control
0x02 rather then 0xc6 like you did for red and blue balance?

Then later on when the "Gain controls in v4l2-ctrl framework" discussion
is done we can change these controls to the new controls.

Ok.
