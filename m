That's already needed, each attachment has it's own sg-list. After all
there's no array of dma_addr_t in the sg tables, so you can't use one sg
for more than one mapping. And due to different iommu different devices
can easily end up with different addresses.

Importers currently cache the mapped sg list aggressively (i915) or
outright pin it for as long as possible (everyone else). So any kind of
moving stuff around is pretty much impossible with current drivers.

The even worse violation of the dma-buf spec is that all the ttm drivers
don't use the sg table correctly at all. They assume that each physical
page has exactly one sg table entry, and then fish out the struct page *
pointer from that to build up their own bo management stuff and ignore
everything else.

Or someone was not chip and put a decent iommu in front of the same IP
block. E.g. the raspi gpu needs contiguous memory for rendering, but the
same block is used elsewhere but then with an iommu.

But thinking about all this I wonder whether we really should start with
some kind of constraint solving. It feels fairly leaky compared to the
encapsulation the dma api provides, and so isn't really better for
upstream than just using ion (which completely gives up on this problem
and relies on userspace allocating correct buffers).

And if we step away for a bit there's already a bunch of things that the
current dma api fails at, and which is just a bit a worse problem with
dma-buf sharing: There's not really a generic way to map an sg table
zero-copy, i.e. there's no generic way to avoid bounce buffers. And that's
already hurting all the existing gpu drivers: ttm essentially does
page-sized allocs for everything and then has it's own dma allocator on
top of that page-cache. i915 has some other hacks to at least not fail the
bounce buffer allocator too badly. Grepping for SWIOTLB in drm is fairly
interesting.

So imo if our goal is to keep the abstraction provided by the dma api
somewhat intact we should first figure out to map an sg table without
copying any data. If we have that any exporter can then easily check
whether an attachment works out by test-mapping stuff. A bit inefficient,
but at least possible (and exporters could cache the mapped sg table if so
desired). And we could rip out a pile of hacks from drm drivers.

The other problem is is coherency management. Even in the single-device
usecase current dma-buf isn't up to things since on many socs the same
device can use both coherent and non-coherent transactions. And if you map
the same memory multiple times we don't really want to flush cpu caches
multiple times (ppl alreay have massive caches and stuff to avoid the
cpu cache flush when there's just one device using the buffer object).
Again this probably needs some core dma api extensions. And again we could
probably throw away a bunch of driver code (at least in i915,
unfortunately there's no intel v4l driver to test non-coherent sharing on
x86).

With all that resolved somehow (and all these issues already affect
single-device dma api usage by gpu drivers) the bit left would be figuring
out where to allocate things. And I'm not even sure whether we should
really bother to implement this in the kernel (no matter how I slice it it
always looks like we're leaking the dma api abstractions) but just with a
few tries in userspace:

- Allocate shared buffers from the scanout engine (or v4l, though that
  doesn't yet support exporting).

- If you can't import, try it the other way round. This isn't perfect for
  cross-process + cross-device bo sharing, but then pretty much all
  compositors have a gpu rendering fallback anyway because this problem is
  a bit too complex to solve perfectly. Of course for the next frame
  compositor can provide a new buffer which hopefully works out better.

- Userspace just knows where to allocate. Imo that's not actually
  unreasonable since if you really have that tricky requirements you
  probably also have insane buffer layouts and then all bets for generic
  code are off anyway.

Cheers, Daniel
