As a random guy reading a big bunch of patches on code I know almost
nothing about, parts of this comment really resonated with me:
overall, we seem to be adding a lot of if statements to code that
appears to be in a hot path.

I.e. ~90% of this patch set seems to be just mechanically dropping
BUG_ON()s and converting open coded stuff to use accessor functions
(which should be macros or get inlined, right?) - and the remaining
bit is not flushing if we don't have a physical page somewhere.

Would it make sense to split this patch set into a few bits: one to
drop all the useless BUG_ON()s, one to convert all the open coded
stuff to accessor functions, then another to do the actual page-less
sg stuff?

Thanks,
