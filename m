Thanks. I thought a bit more on this and decided that I want to make this
declare_dma_contiguous() optional for the drivers. It should be used only
for some sophisticated cases like for example our video codec with two
memory interfaces for 2 separate banks. By default the dma-mapping will
use system-wide cma pool.

Like it was already stated we need such feature for our multimedia codec
to allocate buffers from different memory banks. I really don't see any
problems with the possibility to have additional cma areas for special
purposes.

I really doubt that the device tree will carry only system-independent
information. Anyway, the preferred or required memory areas/banks for
buffer allocation is something that is a property of the hardware not
the OS policy.

I'm trying to create something that will fulfill the requirements of my
hardware, that's why I cannot focus on a generic case only.
