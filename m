I've followed the coding style of the file, but I can certainly change that, 
no issue.

I've discussed this with Hans before, and we thought negotiating data_offset 
wasn't very useful. data_offset values used by applications are pretty much 
mandatory, if you need to write the UV plane of an NV12 image at a given 
offset in a Y+UV contiguous buffer, using a different negotiated offset is 
pointless. Feel free to point us to use cases though.
