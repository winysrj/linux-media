fwiw, what I'm leaning towards right now is combining dma-fence w/
Maarten's idea of dma-buf-mgr (not sure if you saw his patches?).  And
let dmabufmgr handle the multi-buffer reservation stuff.  And possibly
the read vs write access, although this I'm not 100% sure on... the
other option being the concept of read vs write (or
exclusive/non-exclusive) fences.

In the current state, the fence is quite simple, and doesn't care
*what* it is fencing, which seems advantageous when you get into
trying to deal with combinations of devices sharing buffers, some of
whom can do hw sync, and some who can't.  So having a bit of
partitioning from the code dealing w/ sequencing who can access the
buffers when and for what purpose seems like it might not be a bad
idea.  Although I'm still working through the different alternatives.
