Hi Inki,
As also mentioned in the documentation patch, importer (the user of
the buffer) - in this case for current RFC patches on
v4l2-as-a-user[1] vb2 framework - shouldn't release the backing memory
of the buffer directly - it should only use the dma-buf callbacks in
the right sequence to let the exporter know that it is done using this
buffer, so the exporter can release it if allowed and needed.

The proposed RFC for V4L2 adaptation at [1] does exactly the same
thing; detach() before dma_buf_put(), and check in vb2-contig backend
for unmapped() as mentioned above.
