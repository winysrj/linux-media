Hi Manu,

I have submitted a patch for dst.c on 9 Jan 11:46 to linux-media but
have not had any response from anybody since.
Should I have sent the patch directly to you, as you are one the
original authors of the code (assuming that there is only one Manu
Abraham), or is there anything else I should do?

Thanks,
Klaas.
