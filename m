Derek,

I never expected for that response to be taken at face value.  It was to
encourage reflection on the way your original question was phrased and
to point out it's inability to get a conclusive answer.

Also devoid of any fragments of the previous conversation in the thread,
your original question can be construed as inflammatory (i.e. a troll).
Even the most benign tone and intent won't always be conveyed in a
written medium.

The first and third line of my response were crafted such that it could
possibly be construed as a troll.  A bit of irony I was hoping people
would catch.

And I could say the same thing.  Open ended survey questions that can't
yield conclusive results, with no surrounding context in the message,
and yet addressed to a wide audience (i.e. "anyone here") are not
productive, IMO. 

I admire the passion you have about the state of v4l-dvb in your
writings.  So why can't I see that passion in your work?

I'd encourage you to take that energy and passion you have and write
some improvements, go through unit testing, and submit some patches.
It's open source, you can make a difference - you can even author some
of those differences.  If you think it's broken, help us fix it.  If you
don't think you can write code yourself, find a friend who can help you.
I echo your sentiment back to you whole-heartedly: please contribute!

Who says I haven't moved on?  My peeve is inflammatory and derisive
comments and destructive criticism.  These things weigh heavily on me
when I see them.

As CityK rightly guessed, your history of somewhat provocative comments
in postings colored my opinion on your survey question with which I took
issue.  Without context, it appears to be just another in a series.

Regards,
Andy
