If EVIOCGKEYCODEBIG is going to be used as a superset of the old ioctl, 
might it be a good idea change the proposed struct to:

struct keycode_table_entry {
	unsigned keycode;
	unsigned index;
	unsigned type;
	unsigned len;
	char scancode[];
};

Where "type" is used to give a hint of how the scancode[] member should 
be interpreted?

I fully agree!

This won't work for the reason you've already set out...which keymap 
should be deleted?

You really seem to prefer sysfs over ioctls :)

This sounds like 3)

Personally I think 1) is the best approach. Having a device for the 
irrcv device allows for three kinds of operations:

read
----
which corresponds to RX...you're eventually going to want to let 
userspace devices read IR commands which have no entries in a keytable 
yet in order to create keytables for new remotes, the same interface can 
also be used for lirc-type user-space apps which want to access the raw 
pulse/space timings for userspace decoding.

write
-----
which would correspond to TX...I'd suggest a stream of s32 integers to 
imply pulse/space timings.

ioctl
-----
for controlling the RX/TX parameters, creating/destroying additional 
keytables, etc...

Basically, we'll end up with a lirc_dev 2.0. And the "irrcv" class name 
will be misleading since it will be irrcv + irsnd :)
