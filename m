Hi,

Running kernel 2.6.39rc4. I've got trouble with tuning some transponders
on Hotbird 13Â°E with a TT S2-3200.
The transponders have been emitting DVB-S until end of march when they
now emit DVB-S2 signals. They are:
- 11681.00H 27500 3/4 8psk nid:319 tid:15900 on Hotbird 6
- 12692.00H 27500 3/4 8psk nid:319 tid:9900 on Hotbird 9


[1] https://patchwork.kernel.org/patch/244201/
[2] http://www.mail-archive.com/linuxtv-commits@linuxtv.org/msg09214.html

1) Patch [2] is merged into kernel 2.6.39rc4. Using scan-s2, I get no
service available.

2) I applied patch [1] and still could not get any service with scan-s2
from those transponders.

3) I *reverted* patch[2] and now scan-s2 returns partial results.
scan-s2 can tune onto the transponder on Hotbird 6 really quick and
gives back the full services list.
But I have to run scan-s2 with scan iterations count set to as high as
100 to be able to get results from the transponder on Hotbird 9.

When those transponders were emitting in DVB-S, I had no problem at all.

Can someone try the same thing on those transponders and report please ?

Thx
