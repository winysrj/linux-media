Yes, such solution will require highmem. It will introduce the highmem 
issues to systems that typically don't use highmem, that's why I searched
for other solutions.

Right.

The main problem with ARM linear mapping is the fact that it is created 
using 2MiB sections, so entries for kernel linear mapping fits entirely in
first lever of process page table. This implies that direct changing this
linear mapping is not easy task and must be performed for all tasks in the
system. In my CMA v12+ patches I decided to use simpler way of solving this
issue. I rely on the fact that DMA memory is allocated only from CMA regions,
so during early boot I change the kernel linear mappings for these regions.
Instead of 2MiB sections, I use regular 4KiB pages which create 2 level of
page tables. Second level of page table for these regions can be easily
shared for all processes in the system.

This way I can easily update cache attributes for any single 4KiB page that
is used for DMA and avoid any aliasing at all. The only drawback of this
method is larger TLB pressure what might result in some slowdown during
heavy IO if pages with 4KiB linear mapping are used. However with my 
hardware has only slow io (with eMMC I get only about 30MiB/s) so I cannot
notice any impact of the mapping method on the io speed.
