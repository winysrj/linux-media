Agreed, alignment alone isn't enough. But lets assume that an app
knows what a "good" granularity is, and always asks for allocation
sizes which are suitably rounded to allow blocks to be used. Currently
it looks like a "standard" ION_HEAP_TYPE_CARVEOUT heap would give me
back just a PAGE_SIZE aligned buffer. So even *if* the caller knows
its desired block size, there's no way for it to get guaranteed better
alignment, which wouldn't be a bad feature to have.

Anyway as Daniel and Rob say, if the interface is designed properly
this kind of extension would be possible later, or you can have a
special heap with a larger granule.

I suppose it makes sense to remove it while there's no-one actually
implementing it, in case an alternate method proves more usable.
