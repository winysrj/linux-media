Any news on this? Do you have a refined list of kernels which have the
bug and kernels which do not? Tried 2.6.32-rc1? Tried the v4l-dvb
repository?

Anyone else seeing this bug?

Your kernel stack trace doesn't look terribly reliable and I am not
able to come to any conclusion. The crash is supposed to happen in
ir_input_init(), but the stack trace doesn't lead there. I am also
skeptical about the +0x64/0x1a52, ir_input_init() is a rather small
function and I fail to see how it could be 6738 bytes in binary size.
Might be that the bug caused a stack corruption. Building a debug
kernel may help.
