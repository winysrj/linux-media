Guennadi,

As I told you during the KS workshop, my intention were to push first the patches
that were already on my tree (and on linux-next) before the beginning of the merge
window. Unfortunately, The email with the instructions to enable my kernel.org account
arrived only after my return back from KS. This delayed my patch submission to start
only this week, on the trees I maintain.

That's said, analyzing a 100+ patch series git request requires me to reserve
a large amount of time to do such task (one day or two?), as it is something I can't
do partially each day. Next time, please don't hold so many patches to be submitted
altogether, but break it into smaller series. It is much easier to analyze 10 series of
10 patches each, sent along the time, than a big series with 100 patches.

I'll still see if I can analyze and merge those patches during this week, but if I can't
merge them up to Thursday, they'll likely be delayed to 3.3, as we won't have time for
sending them to linux-next in time for 3.2 submission.

Regards,
Mauro
