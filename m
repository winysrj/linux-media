Here is patches to test:
http://git.linuxtv.org/anttip/media_tree.git/log/?h=af9035

After that both af9015+mxl5007t and af9035+mxl5007t started working. 
Earlier both were returning bogus values for chip id read.

Also I am interested to known which kind of communication there is 
actually seen on I2C bus?

If it starts working then have to find out way to fix it properly so 
that any earlier device didn't broke.

regards
Antti
