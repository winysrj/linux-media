O_NONBLOCK means (http://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/functions/open.html#tag_16_412):


O_NONBLOCK
     When opening a FIFO with O_RDONLY or O_WRONLY set:

         If O_NONBLOCK is set, an open() for reading-only shall return without delay. An open() for writing-only shall return an error if no process currently has the file open for reading.

         If O_NONBLOCK is clear, an open() for reading-only shall block the calling thread until a thread opens the file for writing. An open() for writing-only shall block the calling thread until a thread opens the file for reading.

     When opening a block special or character special file that supports non-blocking opens:

         If O_NONBLOCK is set, the open() function shall return without blocking for the device to be ready or available. Subsequent behavior of the device is device-specific.

         If O_NONBLOCK is clear, the open() function shall block the calling thread until the device is ready or available before returning.

     Otherwise, the behavior of O_NONBLOCK is unspecified.

Basically, syscall should not block waiting for some data to be read (or written).
The ioctl definition defines [EAGAIN] error code, if, for any reason, an
ioctl would block.

Btw, the vtunerc doesn't handle O_NONBLOCK flag. For each DVB ioctl, for example
read_snr[1], it calls wait_event_interruptible()[2], even if the application opens
it with O_NONBLOCK flag. So, it is likely that non-blocking-mode applications
will break.

A high delay network (even a congested one) is not broken, if it can
still provide the throughput required by the application, and a latency/QoS
that would fit.

Yes, you can do anything you want at the userspace daemon, but the
non-userspace daemon aware applications will know nothing about it, and
this is the flaw on this design: Applications can't negotiate what network
parameters are ok or not for its usecase.

When you go to network, there are several errors that are transitory. For example,
a dropped link may cause the routing protocol (RIP, BGP or whatever) to re-direct
several routes (or, on a LAN, a spanning-tree re-negotiation), causing a temporary
failure to deliver a few packets. All network-based application are written
to consider temporary failures.

This is fundamentally different than an application designed to talk directly with
the hardware, where an error is generally fatal.

Agreed.
