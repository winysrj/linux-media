He's asking for DVB-T advice

He's asking for USB or PCMCIA - the point is good mentioning the new express standard

I would ask him how much he's ready to pay.

I was using one HVR900 (Haupauge but won't recommend it)

Now I'm using one Terratec T USB XXS

It's much better then the HVR900 one
+ it's supported 
+ it's smaller
+ costs in Austria about 38â‚¬
+ has remote control (also working)

- it's not in the main kernel code - as far as I understood it will be supported in 2.6.32 line
- it is sold with different prod IDs 0078 00ab which makes it necessary to touch the v4l-dvb code
