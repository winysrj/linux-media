Hi,

I have the traffic from this list going to a gmail account. I normally use 
thunderbird to respond to emails and never have issues posting to the ML.

If I'm away from thunderbird and try to respond via the google apps gmail 
interface my mails always get bounced from vger's mail daemon, claiming that the 
message has a html sub-part, and is considered spam or an outlook virus - thus 
rejected.

It's happened a few times, again today when responding to Simon's comment about 
the relationship between the 716x and the 7162 driver.

I don't see any obvious 'use-non-html' formatting setting in gmail.

Perhaps someone else has seen this issue or knows of a workaround?

Comments / feedback appreciated.

Regards,
