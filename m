It becomes a bit more complicated :) - on n900, front camera doesn't use 
CRC, while back camera does. Right now there is no way, even if we use 
video bus switch driver, to tell ISP to have 2 ports with different 
settings, not only for CRC, but for strobe, etc. Look at that commit 
https://github.com/freemangordon/linux-n900/commit/e5582fa56bbc0161d6c567157df42433829ee4de. 
What I think here is that ISP should take settings from the remote 
endpoints rather from it's local port. So far it does not.

So, until there is a way for ISP to have more than one CCP channel with 
different settings, I can't think of anything we can do here but to 
place TODO.
