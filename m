Also that board has no on-board GPU enabled i815EP (P means no on-board GPU).

So I think i810 is fine.

Also hyper-threaded 845G boards, however I'm happy to start a proper
deprecation procedure on the i830 ABI,
Its been a few years since a distro shipped with it, I think even
RHEL5 has the i915 driver enabled, so we are
probably talking RHEL4 era.
