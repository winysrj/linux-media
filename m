Hi,

	Just bought one of these.  It has USB ID: 0xcccd:0x00ab which is not the same 
product code as mentioned in the wiki 0xcccd:0x0078.

This difference prevents driver from recognising the device.

I see there are others on this list with the same problem.

Does anybody know anything about this and what can be done to get it to work?

Dick
