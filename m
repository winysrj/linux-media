We shouldn't be replacing the firmwares that Conexant explicitly gave us
the rights to re-distribute by something else extracted from the
Windows drivers without redistribution rights.

Also, AFAIKT, with regards to the firmwares used on ivtv, there is a
license variant that Hauppauge gave to some distros in the past, after
getting Conexant's agreement for that. The terms used there explicitly
forbids redistribution.

So, if any of the existing firmware doesn't work, we should ask
Conexant (c/c) to send us a firmware that works, under the same terms
they gave us in the past, e. g. with redistribution rights.

Mauro
