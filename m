I have a firedtv c/ci which I have had some success with in linux. I
have no problem tuning and watching/recoding programs as long as they
are not scrambled. If the channel is scrambled I need to tune it twice
before I can watch the channel. I made a post on this some time back,
but didn't get any replies. I have tried figuring out what the problem
is, but without any luck. So as a final desperate measure I've ordered
a new CA module to see if that helps.
