Hi Philipp,

I finished some fairly comprehensive testing on this series,
scaling to and from the following common resolutions:

640x480,
720x480,
720x576,
800x480,
800x600,
1024x768,
1152x720,
1280x720,
1280x768,
1280x800,
1280x1024,
1920x1080,
1920x1200,
2560x1440,
2560x1600,
2592x1944

and within each scaling conversion, I tested converting to and from
all the pixel formats supported by the mem2mem device:

422p, nv12, rgb4, yu12, bgr3, nv16,
rgbp, yuyv, bgr4, rgb3, uyvy, yv12

What I found is that most of these conversions are working, producing
no mis-aligned tile buffer addresses, except for one exception: converting
to or from a packed 24-bit pixel format (rgb3 or bgr3). For example,
try 640x480.rgb3 -> 1920x1080.yu12.

I found the cause of that, I added the following patch to my fork
git@github.com:slongerbeam/mediatree.git, branch imx-mem2mem.3:

"gpu: ipu-v3: image-convert: Fix tile_left_align()"

Feel free to squash it with

"gpu: ipu-v3: image-convert: select optimal seam positions"

I've also added a few other patches to my branch:

"gpu: ipu-v3: Add chroma plane offset overrides to ipu_cpmem_set_image()"

which fixes a false warning in ipu_cpmem_set_yuv_planar_full().

Also added:

"gpu: ipu-v3: image-convert: Prevent race between run and unprepare"
"gpu: ipu-v3: image-convert: Only wait for abort completion if active run"
"gpu: ipu-v3: image-convert: Allow reentrancy into abort"
"gpu: ipu-v3: image-convert: Remove need_abort flag"
"gpu: ipu-v3: image-convert: Catch unaligned tile offsets"

With the fix to tile_left_align(), all conversions for the above scaling
resolutions are not producing mis-aligned tile buffers anymore, for all
pixel formats.

But one last thing. Conversions to and from YV12 are producing images
with wrong colors, it looks like the .uv_swapped boolean needs to be checked
additionally somewhere. Any ideas?
