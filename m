I want to propose another solution to simplify bindings, in fact I have
few ideas to consider:

1. Use named ports instead of address-cells/regs. Ie instead of
port@number schema, use port-function. This will allow to avoid ports
node and #address-cells, #size-cells, reg properties.
Additionally it should increase readability of the bindings.

device {
	port-dsi {
		endpoint { ... };
	};
	port-rgb {
		endpoint { ... };
	};
};

It is little bit like with gpios vs reset-gpios properties.
Another advantage I see we do not need do mappings of port numbers
to functions between dts, drivers and documentation.

2. Similar approach can be taken to endpoint nodes, in fact
as endpoints are children of port node and as I understand port node
have no other children we can use any name instead of endpoint@number,
of course some convention can be helpful.

device {
	port-dsi {
		ep-soc1 { ... };
		ep-soc2 { ... };
	};
	port-rgb {
		ep-panel { ... };
	};
};

I would like to add that those ideas would work nicely with Sylwester's
proposition of skipping endpoints nodes in case there is only one
endpoint - the most common cases are devices with one or two ports, each
port having only one remote endpoint.
The complete graph for DSI/LVDS bridge I work recently will look like:

dsim {
	dsim_ep: port-dsi {
		remote-endpoint = <&bridge_dsi_ep>;
	};
};

bridge {
	bridge_dsi_ep: port-dsi {
		remote-endpoint = <&dsim_ep>;
	};
	bridge_lvds_ep: port-lvds {
		remote-endpoint = <&panel_ep>;
	};
};

panel {
	port-lvds {
		remote-endpoint <&bridge_lvds_ep>;
	};
};

Regards
Andrzej
