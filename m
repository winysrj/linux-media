Thank you for all your good work among those 4 years! You did a great job
with gspca, integrating it upstream and maintaining it along this time.

While it is a bad news that you're not so focused on webcam anymore, it
is great to know that Hans accepted the job of maintaining the drivers.

I hope you all the best!

Could you please write a patch changing the corresponding entries at
MAINTAINERS file?
