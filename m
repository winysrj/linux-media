Do you have a pointer to that patch (-queue) or a tree containing it?
So far I've only found https://patchwork.linuxtv.org/patch/23370/
with those keywords, respectively the thread at 
http://comments.gmane.org/gmane.linux.drivers.video-input-infrastructure/76514
which seems to be partially applied, anything I could test (reproducing
the problem takes its time, probably 4-10 weeks to be really sure, but 
I'd be happy to try or forward port the required parts).

Thanks a lot
