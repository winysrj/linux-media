Ah, ok.

Well, currently, it is returning -EINVAL maybe due to the mass-conversions
you've mentioned.

The point is that -EINVAL has too many meanings at V4L. It currently can be
either that an ioctl is not supported, or that one of the parameters had
an invalid parameter. If the userspace can't distinguish between an unimplemented
ioctl and an invalid parameter, it can't decide if it needs to fall back to
some different methods of handling a V4L device.

Maybe the answer would be to return -ENOTTY when an ioctl is not implemented.

Yes, I know. I'm expecting his comments on it.
