For example, on ARM, there is very limited kernel virtual address space reserved
for DMA coherent buffer mapping, the default size is about 2M if I
don't remember
mistakenly.

Also there is poor performance inside kernel space, see [1]

I think returning vaddr is enough.

No, __get_free_pages returns virtual address instead of 'struct page *'.
