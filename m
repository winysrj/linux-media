Hello to all linux-media list,
I just updated http://www.linuxtv.org/wiki/index.php/Video_via_USB page adding "Somagic devices" point and inner linked page, http://www.linuxtv.org/wiki/index.php/Somagic. On that page are available hardware chips with datasheet where available, windows drivers and logs of SnoopyPro USB Sniffer Utility while attaching device in usb port, after driver is installed.
In same logs archive I added registry info added while driver installing procedure in windows.

I hope this can help a lot investigating about these new "unoffical clones" of EasyCAP DC60+.

TTYman
