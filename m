Hi,

thanks for info. General approach is usually better than device specific
hacks, but it looks like longer run. Unfortunately I returned the device to
the original owner, so I will be probably unable to help with it more. But
the problem needs to be addressed, the state when the remote isn't working
isn't good

thanks & regards

Jaroslav
