If you want to disscuss, please better use wordings. Even my Subject was
not about endless discussion that your userspace aproach is better
(me, Andreas and few others doesn't agree with you, it is your own POV,
nobody follows you, if you not noted) don't be so offensive regarding my code.
I don't thing it is so crap.

This in not only about well-known "fatty" applications like vdr, kaffeine etc.
Using vtunerc allows to use any dvb api compatible tools. Like tools
from dvb-tools package (szap/dvbsnoop/...)

There is no more general way of having dvb adapter virtualized.

Well, yes. I feel the same what wrote Andreas. The only pity is that
nobody from outside linuxm-media need to comment that.
