Hi Guennadi,
I composed that extensive CC list based on what I was able to find in 
MAINTAINERS for any files being modified, additionally adding Catalin 
Marinas as one of the idea promoters. FUJITA Tomonori's name was not 
specified there, nor was he mentioned as an author of any of those 
files. Adding him per your advice.

NB, the rationale quoted above is provided by courtesy of Russell King, 
and not of my authoriship, as it may look like at a first glance from 
your snip result.

Thanks,
Janusz
