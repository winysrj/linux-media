Moikka!
Sounds like device is loosing warm up power during suspend. On USB there 
is two callbacks to resume - resume() and reset_resume(). reset_resume() 
is called when power is lost and on normal case where power has not lost 
resume() is called.

I am not sure what kind of info there is available on I2C 
power-management - but it is one thing to check if there is also that 
same info available.

On power lost chip is reset to default - all registers and firmware also 
is lost. You have to catch that somehow. If I2C power management cannot 
provide that info you could use knowledge registers are set to some 
default value and make decision based of that.

regards
Antti
