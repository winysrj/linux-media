D'oh, sorry, yeah, realized that about 10 minutes after I sent everything.
Figured I'd ping you if you hadn't said anything about 'em in a day or
three.

Note that I've got a git tree I've been maintaining the lirc drivers in
for a while, so whomever is ultimately the gateway, I can also stage
cleanups there -- I'll certainly be pushing any cleanups I do on the lirc
drivers there prior to sending along for upstream, or else I'm liable to
lose track of them... :)
