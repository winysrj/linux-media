Indeed, after some more troubleshooting, I found out that the problem
is not in the STV6110 but in the STV090X code. The card I'm using is a
TT S2-1600.

The function stv090x_read_status() only reports the status when locked.

I couldn't find the datasheet either for this one. Manu is the
maintainer as well. Maybe he has more input on this.

In the meantime, I'll give a closer look at the code see if I can figure
out a way to fix that.


Thanks,
