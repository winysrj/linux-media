I am saying it's a dependency that is currently forced onto every usb
device whether the device even supports rc or not. This is clearly
poor design. For that matter, the whole usb handling must be poor
design if it needs to be overhauled.

I don't know. I'm merely pointing out just one of the issues that
should be resolved if the idea is to fix things that are wrong with
usb handling. If nobody cares, doesn't think it matters, or simply
doesn't want to bother, so be it. I guess I'm crazy but when I'm
facing an overhaul, especially when there's no rush, I compile a list
of _everything_ that's wrong and make sure the overhaul fixes it all.
I guess there's quite a difference between my idea of what an overhaul
should be, and other peoples.

If you really want, there's probably people who deal with embedded
systems where every wasted byte counts, that would agree cleaning up
the waste is a good idea.

Since nobody thinks it should be fixed, just pretend I didn't even
bring it up. Problem solved.
