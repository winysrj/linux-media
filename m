Well, as it is today, it doesn't look very sane to me. The default is to
just return the physical address if the architecture doesn't support it.
So if someone tries this on an arch that hasn't added itself to return
an error they're very likely going to just end up DMAing to an invalid
address and loosing the data or causing a machine check.

Furthermore, the API does not have all the information it needs to do
sane things. A phys_addr_t doesn't really tell you anything about the
memory behind it or what needs to be done with it. For example, on some
arm64 implementations if the physical address points to a PCI BAR and
that BAR is behind a switch with the DMA device then the address must be
converted to the PCI BUS address. On the other hand, if it's a physical
address of a device in an SOC it might need to  be handled in a
completely different way. And right now all the implementations I can
find seem to just assume that phys_addr_t points to regular memory and
can be treated as such.

This is one of the reasons that, based on feedback, our work went from
being general P2P with any device to being restricted to only P2P with
PCI devices. The dream that we can just grab the physical address of any
device and use it in a DMA request is simply not realistic.
