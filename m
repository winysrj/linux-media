Yes, I got it. I merged some leds core fixing patches from you
recently. So could you please split these big patchset into several
small parts which should be easier for reviewing and discussion.
 - led core fixing
 - led flash core patches
 - led flash manager patches
 - v4l2 led patches
 - Documentations

My plan is to review these and merge them to my -devel branch. Then
invite people for testing.

Thanks,
-Bryan
