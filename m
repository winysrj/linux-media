Yes. I think we could use i2c_board_info for passing platform data.

It is how the PHY framework finds a PHY, when the controller (say USB)requests
a PHY from the PHY framework.

I think instead we can use the same data while creating the platform data of
the controller and the PHY.
The PHY driver while creating the PHY (using PHY framework) will also pass the
*data* it actually got from the platform data to the framework.
The PHY user driver (USB), while requesting for the PHY (from the PHY
framework) will pass the *data* it got from its platform data.
The PHY framework can do a comparison of the *data* pointers it has and return
the appropriate PHY to the controller.

I meant something like this
struct phy_info {
	const char *name;
};

struct phy_platform_data {
	.
	.
	struct phy_info *info;
};

struct usb_controller_platform_data {
	.
	.
	struct phy_info *info;
};

struct phy_info phy_info;

While creating the phy device
	struct phy_platform_data phy_data;
	phy_data.info = &info;
	platform_device_add_data(pdev, &phy_data, sizeof(*phy_data))
	platform_device_add();

While creating the controller device
	struct usb_controller_platform_data controller_data;
	controller_data.info = &info;
	platform_device_add_data(pdev, &controller_data, sizeof(*controller_data))
	platform_device_add();

Then modify PHY framework API phy create
	phy_create((struct device *dev, const struct phy_ops *ops,
        void *priv)  {//API changed to take void pointer instead of label
		. //existing implementation
		.
		phy->priv = priv;
	}

	struct phy *phy_get(struct device *dev, const char *string, void *priv) {
//API changed to take an additional pointer
		phy_lookup(priv)
	}

	static struct phy *phy_lookup(void *priv) {
		.
		.
		if (phy->priv==priv) //instead of string comparison, we'll use pointer
			return phy;
	}

PHY driver should be like
	phy_create((dev, ops, pdata->info);

The controller driver would do
	phy_get(dev, NULL, pdata->info);

Now the PHY framework will check for a match of *priv* pointer and return the PHY.

I think this should be possible?

Thanks
Kishon
