+1

Lets stop talkind about GPU direct. Today we can't even make VMA
pointing at a PCI bar work properly in the kernel - lets start there
please. People can argue over other options once that is done.

Make a generic API for all of this and you'd have my vote..

IMHO, you must support basic pinning semantics - that is necessary to
support generic short lived DMA (eg filesystem, etc). That hardware
can clearly do that if it can support ODP.
