The mailinglist archive where poma had written is new to me, no sorry.
Zdenek Stybla hosts the website he advised to me.

When I contacted Zdenek he made contact to a guy from realtek which in
return sent us their (?) new drivers  -  you should contact Zdenek.

I don't work on the rtl2831 sources I'd like to use them :-)

I am looking forward to have current sources at v4l or at least updated
information at the info page at linuxtv.org.

Greetings from Braunschweig, Germany.
