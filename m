av7110 cards may be old, but there are still users of these cards. For

So what do you mean with "deprecated hardware"?

The real advantage of the DVB audio/video/osd API is the possibility
of frame synchronous audio/video/overlay output for high-quality
audio/video playback, maybe with picture-in-picture functionality.

Especially audio synchronization is not easy when the audio format
changes from compressed audio (e.g. AC-3) to PCM (stereo), e.g. on
HDMI output. While HDMI output hardware usually takes video frames and
audio packets (and AVI info frames for audio/video format signalization)
synchronously, V4L2 and ALSA rip these data blocks apart and push these
through different pipelines with different buffering properties. This
makes it very difficult for userspace applications. With the DVB API
the hardware takes care of the synchronisation.

I think this is a common misunderstanding. Video is decoded on separate
hardware blocks nowadays, not on a (3D-)GPU. GPU vendors like to hide this
fact by declaring all blocks together as GPU, but in SoC architectures
like e.g. imx, sunxi, or meson one can easily see separate 2D-GPU, 3D-GPU,
video codec and image processing / video output blocks.
On imx6q for instance we use etnaviv 2D- and 3D-GPU drivers, a coda
video decoder driver, and ipu-v3 video output drivers. While etnaviv and
ipu-v3 are gpu/drm drivers, the coda video decoder is a media/platform
device and not integrated into the drm framework.

You know I want to upstream a driver for (not so modern) FF hardware, with
the DVB audio/video API and without touching anything inside this API (small
additions to the osd API). I still hope this driver can be accepted.

I fully understand the desire for new APIs to support modern hardware
with additional needs. As kernel developer I also understand that it is
easier to create new APIs instead of extending the exiting ones.
As application programmer instead I would prefer to stick with existing
APIs, at least to get some compatibility lib if older APIs are deprecated
and replaced with newer ones.

It is especially confusing for me to see a lot of new APIs with overlapping
scope. The same functionality is handled by different APIs, why?
You mentioned above, video codecs should be handled by DRM, are V4L2
decoder drivers also deprecated?
Video scaling is usually handled by the DRM output pipeline. This is
efficient
since the image is read only once. For instance on imx6 we have a V4L2
mem2mem
scaler instead.
Video output (including overlays) seems to be handled by DRM nowadays, video
input by MC. The whole media subsystem seems not to have any business with
audio anymore. Is the whole V4L2 API superseded by something else?

As you have worked a lot on documentation recently, can you point me to some
documentation how the different APIs are supposed to work together? What API
to use when?

Thanks,
