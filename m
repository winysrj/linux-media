Ok, it's a 1 clock cycle timeout. :D :D :D

Sure, we have to map the errors on our own.
But the datasheet should tell us for which error condition the bridge
returns which i2c state.

The bridge should also be able to detect when something is fundamentally
wrong with SCL/SDA lines (bus not ready).
That's why I wouldn't return ETIMEDOUT for error codes we haven't seen
so far.
ETIMEDOUT for a clock stretching timeout (0x02 or 0x04) is of course right.

Ok. fine, then let's use ENXIO for 0x10.

Yeah, that's very likely.
ETIMEDOUT is ok for a clock stretching timeout, but I wonder why there
should be two of them. Can we narrow that down further ?
If you are looping over reg 0x05 only (not the whole procedure) after a
write for a very long time, which of these two states are temporary and
which never change ?
My theory would be, that one of them is temporary and means "busy,
client holds down SCL" and the other one is final and means "bridge gave
up waiting for the client to continue" (internal timeout).

The register read/write functions currently return the following error
codes:

device disconnected from USB port: -ENODEV
len > URB_MAX_CTRL_SIZE: -EINVAL (Btw, this one should probably should
be changed to a more appropriate error code)

or the error codes from the USB transfer, filtered/maopped with
usb_translate_errors():
-ENOMEM
-ENODEV
-EOPNOTSUPP
-EIO

I'm not sure if it is necessary to filter/map them further.
With the exeception of -EINVAL, they could probably be passed to to the
i2c client, too.
OTOH I doubt than any i2c client implements such a detailed error
handling. ;)
I have no objections against just returning EIO.

Frank
