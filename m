I believe the point was that the real issue was a noise problem in the
stb6100 tuner driver, and that the stb0899 frontend patch just papered
over this.

Please test the driver with the patch Manu refers to and report if there
still are issues.  The patch is now upstream in the 2.6.38 kernel, so
testing it should be fairly easy.  

Do you still have this issue with a plain 2.6.38 driver?
