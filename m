But there can't be any other mapping, which is the whole point of
the exercise to use highmem.
Quoting from the new dma_alloc_area() function:

        c = arm_vmregion_alloc(&area->vm, align, size,
                            gfp & ~(__GFP_DMA | __GFP_HIGHMEM));
        if (!c)
                return NULL;
        memset((void *)c->vm_start, 0, size);

area->vm here points to an uncached location, which means that
we already zero the data through the uncached mapping. I don't
see how it's getting worse than it is already.

I mean not any ZONE_DMA memory, but the memory backing coherent_areas[],
which is by definition DMA-able from any device and is what is currently
being used for the purpose.
