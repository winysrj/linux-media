Good to know. However, the first revisions of silicon tuners like the
tda8274 can't compete with can tuners. Only the tda8275a hybrid can come
_close_ to a good can tuner like the FMD1216ME/I H-3 (MK3) on a well
designed PCB. Signal quality might be still not sufficient for your
card.

You also had parity errors on your first report, which likely indicate
problems on your mobo at least with this PCI slot and/or sharing
interrupts with other devices there.

No. You can force tuner types only for analog TV. The tda8274 is not a
hybrid tuner, it is only used for DVB-T. An early tda8275 hybrid with a
saa7134 chip would have a separate tda8290 chip for analog IF
demodulation. Without that no analog TV and no tuner type to set.

For DVB-T the tda8274 is treated like a tda8275.
