Hi, the question you ask needs an answer in the form of basic digital tv 
tutorial. I suggest you search the web for that info.

Regarding software I suggest you look at the tvheadend project. It has a 
software model that is easy to understand.

Regarding hardware I would go for quad pcie in a form factor that would 
fit in rack-mounted servers. You need high density and that is the only 
way to get that. So I would say skip trying to find something cheap, get 
something that is reliable and maintainable.
