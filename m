Ah, after looking at the specs I now understand what you do mean. This is
about the temperature of the LED, not the flash controller chip itself.

The actual implementation appears to be an NTC resistor.

How about V4L2_FLASH_FAULT_LED_OVER_TEMPERATURE?

What would you think of V4L2_FLASH_FAULT_INPUT_VOLTAGE?

"Input voltage monitor" looks like a chip specific term; another chip could
well use something else.
