You reply to subscription confirmation mails that you have not asked for?
Seriously...

I was expecting somehow that either the Debian maintainer or the upstream
maintainer of linuxtv-dvb-apps thought that it was a good idea to receive
Debian BTS mails on his mailing list.

If that's not the case, someone should unsubscribe again (or I can do it
for you). Ccing the debian maintainers to verify.

Cheers,
