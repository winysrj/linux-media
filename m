Okay, so how about "demuxing" the first protocol before handing them
to encoder callback? Simply something like below:

-               if (handler->protocols & protocols && handler->encode) {
+               if (handler->protocols & ffs(protocols) && handler->encode) {

Now the behavior is well-defined even when multiple protocols are selected.

Keeping dynamically filled lists sorted is a good practice if one
wishes to achieve determinism in behavior (like running decoders
always in certain order too).
