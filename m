For your kind attention 
Could you please consider helping me to relocate this sum of Ten Million five hundred thousand dollars (us$10.5m) to your Country for establishing an industry in your country. 
 
This fund was deposited in our bank by Mr. Paul Louis Halley from France who died in a plane crash in 2003 TBM 700 aircraft on 6 December with his wife and the whole crew on board. 
 
Without a (heir) hence the money is floating and if I do not remit this money out urgently it will be forfeited for nothing and the big guns at the herms of administration at the bank will share this fund amongst themselves as it has been done if no trace of heir to such fund is found. 
 
We have tried to contact his family to come forward for claims but could not succeed.

I will give you all vital information concerning the France citizen and the $10.5m in our custody so that you will contact my bank for them to release the money to you as the next of kin to the deceased person. 
 
You will have to establish contact with the bank while i will guide you on the steps to follow till the transfer of this fund reaches to you and your account. 
 
As one of the bank directors, I will play a role to make sure that the fund is released to you. 
 
This is a legitimate transaction and you will be compensated with 40% for your assistance for presenting yourself as the next of kin and account to receive this fund in your country. If you are interested please write back for more clarifications. 
 
I will know that actually you are ready to be my partner and then I will have to send to you a draft application form which you are to fill and apply for the release of the fund to your account in your desired country. 
Mrs Diani Kabori.
