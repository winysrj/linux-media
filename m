That sounds fair, emails will be. I stepped forward because even if I
don't want to invest too much time in the protocol analysis phase I can
do the integration work, so that we can get a gspca_kinect driver
eventually; if "eventually" is a good enough deadline for you as a
sponsor then we are set. Obviously with some collaboration the driver
will be delivered sooner than "eventually", and I am pretty sure that is
going to come ;)
