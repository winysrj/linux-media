Ok, got it. So I guess the behavior of forcing aligned accesses on aligned
data is accidental, and allowing non-power-of-two arguments is also not
the main purpose. Maybe we could just bail out on new compilers if we get
either of those? That might catch code that accidentally does something
that is inherently non-atomic or that causes a trap when the intention was
to have a simple atomic access.
