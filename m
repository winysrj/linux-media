Agreed.

Agreed.

I don't see the point in that code ... Why can't we drop the kref
_outside_ of the critical section protected by event_queue_lock? Then you
pretty much have an open-coded version of dma_fence_callback_cancel in
there.

I don't see how updating the jiffies_left timeout is that onerous, and in
any case we can easily wrap that up into a little helper function, passing
in an array of dma_fence pointers.

Creating interfaces that differ from established kernel api patterns otoh
isn't good imo. I.e. I want dma_fence_wait_bla to be a drop-in replacement
for the corresponding wait_event_bla function/macro, which the same
semantics for the timeout and return values.

Differing in such things only leads to confusion when reading patches imo.

See above ;-)

If we allow ->enable_signalling to be called from irq context, all
spinlocks the driver grabs need to be irq safe. If we disallow this I
guess some drivers could easily get by with plain spinlocks.

And since we both agree that it would be crazy to call ->enable_signalling
from irq context, I think we should bake this constrain into the
interface.
