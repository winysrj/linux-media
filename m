One is a *PHY provider* driver which is a driver for some PHY device. This will
use phy_create to create the phy.
The other is a *PHY consumer* driver which might be any controller driver (can
be USB/SATA/PCIE). The PHY consumer will use phy_get to get a reference to the
phy (by *phandle* in the case of dt boot and *label* in the case of non-dt boot).

I agree with you on the device id part. That need not be known to the PHY driver.

Thanks
