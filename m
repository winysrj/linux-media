I've just noticed that there are updated informations on the wiki about
this.

I live in Italy.
I'm in EU, but it seems to me that we don't have such a law.
In Italy we have such possibility only for 10 days and only when we
don't buy in a store.

Anyway I've bought the stick in a store where they offer this
possibility for 8 day.
I was lucky enough to find a WinTV HVR 900 without the H in the same
store on
the same shelf.
The box is identical to the version with the H. The model is reported as
254 in both case.
The only difference is that the H version reported the line
SL-254-V2.1-ITAL while the
one without H reported SL-254-V2.0-ITAL.

Many thanks for Your replies and Your work!

Cheers,
    Giulio.
