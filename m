Thanks much for the analysis, Andy. I see the problem now. The intf0 urb
callback is wired up before the rc_dev is, and the callback is what makes
the rc_g_keycode_from_table call. And as far as I know, all 0xffdc devices
have the nasty trait of constantly triggering interrupts, even when there's
no valid keydata. (SoundGraph fixed that in later devices). The code has
been like this for some time, and I do have 0xffdc devices, none of which
have hit this somehow, but the fix looks simple and obvious enough. I'll
try to get something sent along later today.
