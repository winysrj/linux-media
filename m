Subject: [PATCH v1 0/2] Remove duplicate driver for MyGica T230C

In 2017-02, two drivers for the T230C where submitted, but until now
only the one based on the older dvb-usb/cxusb.c driver has been part
of the mainline kernel. As a dvb-usb-v2 driver is preferable, remove
the other driver.

The cxusb.c patch also contained an unrelated change for the T230,
i.e. a correction of the RC model. As this change apparently is
correct, restore it. This has not been tested due to lack of hardware.
