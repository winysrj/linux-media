The bounty is already taken by that developer.

But now, the Kinect thing is supported like a GPL userspace library.
Maybe still need more work to be rewritten as a kernel module.

The device has also a microphone (still need to be hacked), an
accelerometer and even a motor/engine.
The design should be similar to the ps3eye (but 2 video output).
The engine controller and the accelerometer needs to be adressed to
which place ? Linux-input ?.
