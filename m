I know this comes quite late after the first patch series has been sent, 
but I'd like to ask if you have you considered a different approach: 
rather than implementing something entirely new, the Media controller 
can almost do this already. It models the physical layout of the device, 
instead of creating special use case specific Media entity like 
constructs for tuner and audio. Also the Media token framework does not 
appear to be as a perfect match for the Media controller framework which 
is also planned to be used by DVB already:

<URL:http://linuxtv.org/news.php?entry=2014-10-21.mchehab>; look for "3) 
DVB API improvements". There have been ALSA MC patches as well but I'm 
not aware of the status of those at the moment.

The tokens appear much like media entities of specific kind to me.

Currently, media entities may only be entities bound to a given 
subsystem, but I don't think it has to (or perhaps even may) stay that way.

In case of the Media controller, mutual exclusion of different users is 
currently performed by adding the entities to a pipeline and 
incrementing the streaming count once streaming is enabled --- on 
different interfaces streaming may mean a different thing.

The Media controller interface does not handle serialising potential 
users that may wish to configure the device. If that's needed then we'll 
need to think how to add it.
