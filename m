Hi Laurent,

I don't want to sound impatient, but I as I don't know what your usual 
reaction times to patches are and already waited three weeks without any 
reaction, I kindly want to ask, if you already had a chance to look into this 
patch and consider it for inclusion into your tree?

Best,
Daniel
