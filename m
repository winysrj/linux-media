Thank you for submitting it :-)

Your understanding is correct (as far as I know).

Marking the memory pointed to by the pointer as const ensures that the 
function won't modify memory that the caller thought wouldn't be modified. It 
thus serves as a contract between the caller and the callee, enforced by the 
compiler.

Marking the pointer as const, on the other hand, only affects the function 
implementation, without influencing its call contract. Its only use in this 
case would be to prevent the function from modifying a pointer that the 
function itself thought it shouldn't modify. While not useless in all cases, 
this compile-time checked if usually not performed in the kernel, especially 
for simple functions. I'm not aware of any explicit rule regarding const usage 
though.
