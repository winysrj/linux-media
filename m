There's a Wikipedia article:

<URL:http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differential_pulse-code_modulation>

It's the same DPCM encoding as in many of the compressed raw bayer formats.

That's somewhat subjective and hardware dependent. If I understand this 
correctly, the "advanced" should differ only quality-wise from "simple" 
option. Why one would use "simple" instead of "advanced" then? Perhaps 
mostly for testing purposes; it might be that the advanced predictor 
could have issues in certain cases where the simple would not. However 
this isn't the only piece of hardware where I see that this is 
configurable, and the simple one was even the default.

It's not --- DPCM compression is typically used on the bus between the 
sensor and the receiver to compress the data as the bus is often a 
limiting factor in the transfer rate. DPCM compression can be used to 
squeeze the data from 10 to 8 bits without much loss in quality or 
dynamic range.
