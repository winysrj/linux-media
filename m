Hello everybody.
I'm evaluating a dvb-t card for linux.
I would like to know if with the above
card is possible to save the entire mpeg
transport stream.
Also I don't unstand what does mean 'dual
tuners'. Can I watch two different dvb-t
channel? Or only one analog and one dvb-t?
Or 2 dvb-t plus 2 analog?
Any experience with this device?

PS: Is possible to see with xine/vlc/mplayer
a dvb-t/h264 stream with this card?

TIA
