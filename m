s/lock/contending_lock/ I guess. But yeah, I should have more
carefully read Peter's suggestion to fold in some of the ww_slow debug
checks, we can indeed keep the important debug checks even when
dropping slow. Silly me should be less sloppy.

So either we keep the _slow versions or drop the __must_check for
ww_mutex_lock. In both cases the ww mutex user needs to think a bit
what to do, and I don't there's much we can do in the implementation
(beside all the existing debug support we have) to help. So now I'm
leaning more towards dropping the _slow variants to avoid interface
proliferation.
