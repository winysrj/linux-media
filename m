Huh?  I wonder where you got that idea.  Let me show an example of
what I mean.

	void listener()
	{
		int in = socket();
		int out = open("/dev/dsp");
		char buf[];

		while (1) {
			recv(in, buf, packetsize);
			write(out, buf + offset, datasize);
		}
	}

See?

That is news to me.  I don't recall ever having seen AVB described
like that before.

So you would like a remote listener to appear in the system as a local
PCM audio sink?  And a remote talker would be like a local media URL?
Sounds unworkable to me, but even if you were to implement it, the
logic would surely belong in alsa-lib and not in the kernel.  Behind
the enulated device, the library would run a loop like the example,
above.

In any case, your patches don't implement that sort of thing at all,
do they?

Thanks,
Richard
