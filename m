Greetings from Dr. Ayman Aliman

Dear friend, I am DR. AYMAN ALIMAN. THE MANAGER, AUDIT AND ACCOUNTING DEPT.BANK OF AFRICA (B.O.A) Burkina Faso . 

I know my message will come to you as a surprise. Don't worry I was totally convinced to write you, I hoped that you will not expose or betray this trust and confident that i am about to repose on you for the mutual benefit of our families. 

I need your urgent assistance in transferring sum of (USD $18.700, 000.00) into your account within 10 to 14 banking days. This requires a private arrangement; the details of the transaction will be furnished to you if you indicate your interest in this proposal. 

This money has been dormant for years in our bank without claim, I want the bank to release the money to you as the nearest person (owner of the account)who died along with his entire family during the Iraq war in 2006

I don't want the money to go into our bank treasurer account as an abandoned fund. So this is the reason why i contact you so that the bank will release the money to you as the next of kin to the death customer and we share the money together. Please i would like you to keep this proposal as a top secret. 

Upon receipt of your reply, I will give you full details on how the business project will be executed and also note that you will have 40% of the above mentioned sum.

Kindly fill this information's requested below in returns then i will give you more details with application form for the claim. 

Your full name: -- 
Your Country: -- 
Phone Number: -- 
Your Age and occupation: -- 

I expect your urgent response if you agree to handle this project. 

Best regard. 

Dr. Ayman Aliman
