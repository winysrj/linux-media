It won't be a problem.  Now the system_wq supports parallel execution
of multiple works and manages concurrency automatically.  Work items
can sleep as necessary without worrying about other work items.

IIUC, if they spend any significant amount of time executing, they'll
be doing so by waiting for events (mutex, IRQ...), right?  If so,
there's nothing to worry about.  If it's gonna burn a lot of CPU
cycles, we'll need to use a workqueue marked CPU_INTENSIVE but I don't
think that's the case here.

Thank you.
