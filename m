We can always discuss extensions to the existing infrastructure, adding
an interface for mapping an array of page pointers in the iommu API
sounds like a good idea.

I also think that we should not really have separate iommu and dma-mapping
interfaces, but rather have a portable way to define an iommu so that it
can be used through the dma-mapping interfaces. I'm not asking you to
do that as a prerequisite to merging your driver, but it may be good to
keep in mind that the current situation is still lacking and that any
suggestion for improving this as part of your work to support the
samsung IOMMU is welcome.

Note that the ARM implementation of the dma-mapping.h interface currently
does not support IOMMUs, but that could be changed by wrapping it
using the include/asm-generic/dma-mapping-common.h infrastructure.
