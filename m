Hi Patrick, first off, thanks for your hard work!

I was just wondering if there's an ETA, or if there is something we can do to
help get these drivers released?

My company just bought a large number of cards to find they're an unsupported
rev.  We were about to send them back when I found this post.

The Skystar 2's have always been an excellent choice for our application, I'd
really hate to have to start supporting/sourcing another device.

Thanks, Ian
