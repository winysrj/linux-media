Hi,

Apologies for the late reply. I have a few comments, but nothing major.

I don't think this is actually required in all cases. It's a standard property
that people can add if it happens to be required in a particular instance.

> +- interrupts        : fimc-is interrupt to the parent interrupt controller

Is this the only interrupt the device generates? If so:

- interrupts: interrupt-specifier for the fimc-is interrupt.

There are multiple of these, so how about the following instead:

The i2c-isp nodes should be children of the fimc-is node.

It might be worth pointing out that ranges, #address-cells, and #size-cells
should be present as appropriate.

Similarly, s/should be/must contain/

I'd prefer clocks to be described as for the simc-is, with clock names being
something like:

- clock-names: should contain "i2c_isp" for the gate clock.

I'd prefer a mention of pinctrl-0 and pinctrl-names, as that's what most other
bindings do.

Also, as this is described as required it should be in the example.

These don't seem to be in the example and probably should be.

Otherwise, this looks fine. With those points fixed up:
