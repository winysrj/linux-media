Mauro and Devin, I think you're missing the point. This is not about
creating drivers in userspace. This is not about open or closed source.
The "vtuner" interface, as implemented for the Dreambox, is used to
access remote tuners: Put x tuners into y boxes and access them from
another box as if they were local. It's used in conjunction with further
software to receive the transport stream over a network connection.
Honza's code does the same thing.

You don't need it in order to create closed source drivers. You can
already create closed kernel drivers now. Also, you can create tuner
drivers in userspace using the i2c-dev interface. If you like to connect
a userspace driver to a DVB API device node, you can distribute a small
(open or closed) wrapper with it. So what are you arguing about?
Everything you're feared of can already be done since virtually forever.

If you're feared of exposing kernel interfaces to userspace, then I
think your only option is to remove the whole userspace. You might want
to remove i2c-dev and the loadable module interface first.

Regarding the code, Honza, I think the interface is neither clean nor
generic enough to be included in the kernel. It doesn't make much sense
to stay compatible to the interface used by the Dreambox. This interface
evolved from very old versions of the DVB API and therefore carries way
too much cruft and hacks for a shiny new interface. As a side note: Your
ioctl constants already differ from the original vtuner code.

IMO, at least these steps need to be taken:
- Remove unused code. You already mentioned it, but it really should be
removed before submitting code, because it makes review much harder.
- Remove redefined structs and constants.
- Drop support for anything older than S2API.
- Define a way to use an existing demux instead of registering a new
software demux. On hardware that supports it, an input channel should be
allocated for each vtuner, in order to use the hardware's filtering and
decoding capabilities.
- Drop VTUNER_SET_NAME, VTUNER_SET_HAS_OUTPUTS, VTUNER_SET_MODES,
VTUNER_SET_TYPE and VTUNER_SET_NUM_MODES. They are all either specific
to the Dreambox or already obsoleted by S2API commands or should be
implemented as new S2API commands.

Regards,
Andreas
