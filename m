Agreed.

I think only allowing streaming access makes the most sense:
- I don't see much (if any need) for the kernel to access a dma_buf -
in all current usecases it just contains pixel data and no hw-specific
things (like sg tables, command buffers, ..). At most I see the need
for the kernel to access the buffer for dma bounce buffers, but that
is internal to the dma subsystem (and hence does not need to be
exposed).
- Userspace can still access the contents through the exporting
subsystem (e.g. use some gem mmap support). For efficiency reason gpu
drivers are already messing around with cache coherency in a platform
specific way (and hence violated the dma api a bit), so we could stuff
the mmap coherency in there, too. When we later on extend dma_buf
support so that other drivers than the gpu can export dma_bufs, we can
then extend the official dma api with already a few drivers with
use-patterns around.

But I still think that the kernel must not be required to enforce
correct access ordering for the reasons outlined in my other mail.
