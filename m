Good, thanks.

Ali, speaking from experience, it can take a long time to get public 
datasheets out of Conexant. They have a lot to preserve and protect. On 
the other hand they've also been very co-operative with the community. 
Sit tight and wait, if you'd wanted to use your board under Linux from 
the beginning then you should of bought a different board.

Bombarding Conexant via email will only delay things and sour any 
relationship certain members of the community already have established.
