Except if you actually tested it with all em2800 devices, I think that
this change just broke it for em2800.

Maybe Sascha could review this patch series on his em2800 devices.

Those devices are limited, and just like other devices (cx231xx for example),
the I2C bus need to split long messages, otherwise the I2C devices will
fail.

Btw, there was already a long discussion with regards to splitting long
I2C messages at the I2C bus or at the I2C adapters. The decision was
to do it at the I2C bus logic, as it is simpler than making a code
at each I2C client for them to properly handle -EOPNOTSUPP and implement
a fallback logic to reduce the transfer window until reach what's
supported by the device.

So, for now, I won't apply this patch series (except for patch 1, with
is obviously correct).

Cheers,
Mauro
