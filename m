This is what I don't understand. By setting pad ipu2_csi1:2 to
"none", the if statement below should be true (sink pad field
is "interlaced" and the capture field is propagated from ipu2_csi1:2
field so it is "none", thus ipu_cpmem_interlaced_scan() will be called.

And yes you are correct, ipu_cpmem_interlaced_scan() must be
called to enable IDMAC interweave, which is what you want.

No the code above is not unclear at all. The if statement is saying
that if the user wants progressive output (V4L2_FIELD_NONE), and
the input contains fields, then turn on interweave in the IDMAC
channel.

This might be a good time to bring up the fact that the ADV7180 driver 
is wrong
to set output to "interlaced". The ADV7180 does not transmit top lines 
interlaced
with bottom lines. It transmits all top lines followed by all bottom 
lines (or
vice-versa), i.e. it should be either V4L2_FIELD_SEQ_TB or 
V4L2_FIELD_SEQ_BT.
It can also be set to V4L2_FIELD_ALTERNATE, and then it is left up to 
downstream
elements to determine field order (TB or BT).

I've previously sent a patch to fix this at 
https://patchwork.linuxtv.org/patch/36193/
but it got lost. Niklas has said he will pick this up again.

Well, given that this bit exists, and assuming I understand it correctly 
(1),
I guess the U and V components for odd rows normally are placed on the
AXI bus. Which is a total waste of bus bandwidth because in 4:2:0,
the U and V components are the same for odd and even rows.

In other words for writing 4:2:0 to memory, this bit should _always_ be set.

(1) OTOH I don't really understand what this bit is trying to say.
Whether this bit is set or not, the data in memory is correct
for planar 4:2:0: y plane buffer followed by U plane of 1/4 size
(decimated by 2 in width and height), followed by Y plane of 1/4
size.

So I assume it is saying that the IPU normally places U/V components
on the AXI bus for odd rows, that are identical to the even row values.
IOW somehow those identical odd rows are dropped before writing to
the U/V planes in memory.

Philipp please chime in if you have something to add here.
