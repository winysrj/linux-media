Indeed, that's actually how the driver works today since is the model I in
commit f7b4b54e6364 ("[media] tvp5150: add HW input connectors support").

But after the patches landed, I was told that the DT binding was
wrong because it didn't use the OF graph (so got reverted) and that
it didn't model the connectors correctly since there weren't three
different physical connectors but three different "connections"
that used two physical connectors.

That's why I thought the latest agreed approach was to model the
actual pins and signals as PAD instead of a simplified version.

It seems now that is agreed how the DT binding should look like
(basically use OF graph ports and endpoints) but we still are
discussing what the entities, PADs and links should model.

I see, it would be nice though to think about that case too so
the DT bindings can be consistent for both analog and digital.
