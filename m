Hi Greg,

Thanks for comments. I CC Laurent, I hope it could be interesting for 
him also.

I would treat this series as a real RFC, with code which can be easily 
tested by volunteers but as for RFC I am asking for comments if the idea 
is OK and the patchset have chances to be accepted.
Anyway, I have performed some basic tests and it works :)

Container code seems to solve very specific problem, not really relevant 
to this patchset. The component code would solve a very specific part of 
problems this framework solves as described in use cases above. On the 
other side problems which components solves are
solvable with this framework.

Managed token interface is about sharing 'named' resources it is not 
connected with interface tracking.

I should correct my last sentence to this:
I will be glad if it can be used at least with video interfaces, ie. 
drm_panel, video encoders/bridges, image enhancers.

The main problem with component framework is that componentization 
significantly changes every driver and changes it in a way which is not 
compatible with traditional drivers, so devices which are intended to 
work with different DRM masters are hard to componentize if some of DRMs 
are componentized and some not.

If you look at interface_tracker framework it achieves the same goal
as componentization without even touching panel drivers, look at 2nd 
patch of the patchset - it adds interface_tracker support for all panels 
with 7 lines of code in drm_panel framework and of course the
change is backward compatible.
Adding interface_tracker support to the 'master' requires more work:
1. registration of the callback.
2. unregistration of the callback.
3. the callback code.
But it is still much less than in case of components.

And interface_tracker framework allows much more, as I described in "Use 
cases" and "Potential use cases" sections.
