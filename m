Hello,

a year ago I bought a device named "Hama Video Editor", which was not
(and is not yet) supported by the em28xx driver.
So I played around with the card parameter and got the device basically
working with card=38.
Basically working means, that I had a distortion when capturing old
VHS-Tapes from my old vcr.

The problem can be seen here:
http://www.michael-ruettgers.de/em28xx/test.avi

A few weeks ago I started tracking down the reason for this issue with
the help of Devin.
Wondering, that the device works perfectly in Windows, I compared the
i2c commands, that programmed the register of the tvp5150 in Windows.

Finally I got the device working properly, setting the "TV/VCR" option
in the register "Operation Mode Controls Register" at address 02h
manually to "Automatic mode determined by the internal detection
circuit. (default)":

000109:  OUT: 000000 ms 107025 ms 40 02 00 00 b8 00 02 00 >>>  02 00

After programming this register, the distortion issue disappeared.

So my conclusion was, that the TV/VCR detection mode is forced to
TV-mode in the em28xx, which could have been verified by a look into the
debug output using the parameter reg_debug=1:

OUT: 40 02 00 00 b8 00 02 00 >>> 02 30

Bit 4, 5 are used for setting the TV/VCR mode:

Description in the Spec:
> TV/VCR mode
>   00 = Automatic mode determined by the internal detection circuit.
(default)
>   01 = Reserved
>   10 = VCR (nonstandard video) mode
>   11 = TV (standard video) mode
> With automatic detection enabled, unstable or nonstandard syncs on the
input video forces the detector into the VCR
> mode. This turns off the comb filters and turns on the chroma trap
filter.

Thus far the tvp5150 distortion issues when capturing from vcr.

-----------

The device not supported yet but mostly working with card=38 has the
following features:

1 Button
1 LED
1 S-VHS input
1 Composite video input (Chinch) 
1 Stereo audio input (2 x Chinch)

The inputs are matched correctly to the video sources in a viewer-app
(S-VHS -> S-VHS, Composite -> Composite1).


It's product name is "Hama USB 2.0 Video Editor":

This board has no unique USB ID but could be detected by its i2c
devicelist hash "0x77800080":

This board seem to be branded under another name in Austria:

I would appreciate to see this device beeing detected and working
correctly for capturing even from a vcr with weak sync signals.

Thanks.
