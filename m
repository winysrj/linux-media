The driver has split code for handling framebuffer devices, the framebuffer
base address will also vary depending on the type of device it has, for
some its on the encoder, for others its on the decoder. We'd have to account
for the removal of the framebuffer on either of those regions, and would also
need some vetting that the driver doesn't use areas beyond that for MMIO.
Using the trick you suggest though we could overlap ioremap calls and if that
truly works on PAT and non-PAT adding a new ioremap_wc() could do the trick,
I'd appreciate a Tested-by or Acked-by to be done with this. Mauro, any chance
we can get a tested-by of ivtvfb for both non-PAT and PAT systems with this:

Provided the above ivtv driver changes are OK this would be the *last* and only
driver required to be changed.

Great, happy with this, but we need to address the last few drivers and their
exisitng code then.
