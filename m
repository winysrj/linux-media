I'm not aware of any activity, you're the first to ask about this on the linux-media
mailinglist.

However, a quick google turns up this:

Hard to tell since I do not know the hardware. Basically anything from a week
to a year or more :-)

It depends on whether there is any code out there for driving the camera stack
that you can base your work on and whether you have datasheets and how complex
the HW is.
