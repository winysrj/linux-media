Does it work for TW6868-based capture cards? Like one, IVCE-T608, by iEi?

There is a really great driver for the thousands of capture cards
floating around ebay called TW68. It is available here:
http://gitorious.org/tw68

I'm not a developer but I have been using it for a number of years and
it's a shame it's still not included in the kernel.

Is anyone interested in making this happen?
