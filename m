Not really.  But yes, it produces some bloat when neither CMA nor
compaction are compiled.  I assume that linker will be able to deal
with that (since the functions are not EXPORT_SYMBOL'ed).

Note also that the was majority of compaction.c is #ifdef'd though
so only a handful of functions are compiled.

I could imagine that someone would want to have CMA but not compaction,
hence I decided to give that choice.
