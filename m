I mean photometry which is all about light meter (or exposure meter).
Like spot metering, center weighted things..

Thank you for you encouraging words.
Actually I'm working on some ISP devices from NEC, Fujitsu. and ARM SOC
camera interface peripheral like PXA3, S3C64XX, OMAP3..
I wish I could make a device very close to a real digital camera.
It wouldn't take so long until I submit a RFC about V4L2 API for digital
camera :) (I hope so at least)
Cheers.

Nate
