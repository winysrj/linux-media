A Merlin firmware of 16 kB strongly suggests that this chip has an
integarted Conexant CX25843 (Merlin Audio + Thresher Video = Mako)
Broadtcast A/V decoder core.  The chip might only have a Merlin
integrated, but so far I've never encountered that.  It will be easy
enough to tell, if the Thresher registers don't respond or only respond
with junk.

The Merlin has an integrated 8051 microcontroller that, if you are
decoding SIF audio from an analog tuner, will periodically reprogram
registers in the Merlin core to do spectral analysis of the SIF to
determine the broadcast audio standard (BTSC, etc.).

A public datasheet for the CX25843 is here:
http://dl.ivtvdriver.org/datasheets/video/cx25840.pdf

There appear to be at least two families of CX25843 cores:

- the core in the stand-alone CX2584[0123] chips and the '843 core
integrated into the CX23418

- the core integrated into the CX2388[578] and CX2310[012] chips, which
have a slightly different register defintion in some places 


The cx25840 driver under linux handles most of these, except that the
cx18 driver has it's own fork of the cx25840 driver in its cx18-av-*
files.  The core is normally I2C connected, except for the one
integrated into the CX23418.

If the empia device driver needs to support a CX25843 core, I highly
recommend forking a copy of the cx25840 driver specifically for the
empia devices, as opposed to trying to fit in yet another variant in the
cx25840 driver itself. 

FWIW, since the CX2310[012] devices are also USB connected, maybe that
driver can provide some basis for comparison along with the USB traces
you already have.  (I haven't compared them myself.)

Andy
