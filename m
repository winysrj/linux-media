Hi Mauro,

Can you give an update of the current status of the MC work? To be honest,
I've lost track.

In particular, is there anything I and/or others need to review before you
can start merging patches?

This is also relevant for the workshop agenda. I plan to put any MC topics
at the end of the workshop. As you mentioned in a mail exchange with Shuah,
as long as these patches aren't merged there is not all that much point in
discussing future work.

Regards,

	Hans
