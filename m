This may work, but it means that every single I2C/frontend/tuner will require two
entries for each driver. This means to create and manage around 100+ new symbols.
The drivers/media Kconfig files are complex enough as-is, without adding those 100+
new artificial symbols. We should work to make things simple and improve users experience,
and not to create artificial complexity that will make Kconfig almost unreadable.

I still think that the easiest way to solve this is to add some logic that will
hide the menu if a condition doesn't happen. Something like:
	menu FOO
		prompt if BAR

or
	menu FOO
		show if BAR
