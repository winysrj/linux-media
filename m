I am running a simple test to allocate contiguous regions and write a log on
in a file on sdcard simultaneously. I can reproduce this migration failure 100%
times with it.
when I tracked the pages that failed to migrate, I found them on the
buffer head lru
list with a reference held on the buffer_head in the page, which
causes drop_buffers()
to fail.

So, i guess my question is, until all the migration failures are
tracked down and fixed,
is there a plan to retry the contiguous allocation from a new range in
the CMA region?
