Sorry for the misunderstanding. I wanted to say that, there is no SW controlled
reset. In the board we're using to connect the sensor to our D-PHY we have a
GPIO controller that when it receives power, it removes the sensor from reset,
so I have no control over that.

Regarding the clock, should I create a new property?

And also, regarding the data-lanes, AFAIK it isn't possible to change the order
of the data and clock lanes so should I remove that property?
