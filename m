I agree 100%, I'd have liked to do the caching for the direct-loading
case too. It's just that the freeing case for that is so intimately
tied to the firmware_buf format which is actually very inconvenient
for direct-loading, that making that happen looked a lot more
involved.

And I was indeed hoping you'd look at it, since you touched the code
last.  "Tag, you're it"

It shouldn't be *too* bad to instead of doing the "vmalloc()" allocate
an array of pages and then using "vmap()" instead in order to read
them (we end up doing the vmap anyway, since the firmware *user* wants
a virtually contiguous buffer), but the code will definitely get a bit
more opaque.
