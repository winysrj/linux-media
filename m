Well I did try the card= option before and it worked in a way.  The 
raster was compressed though and the image was not really acceptable.

I'm happy to wait.

Is there something I can do in the mean time?  If I can download some 
code and start playing, I would do so if I knew where to look.

Tell me where to start and I will do.

PS  In fact I think I have 2 x ImpactVCB-e's, so if your card is very 
delayed, I could send you one.  If you're in the Netherlands it won't 
take long to get to you.
