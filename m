My apologies. What happened was that I originally had sent these two
patches to the staging mailing list. Greg KH advised me to send these
to Mauro and the linux-media mailing list instead. As a result, there
was a debate about the way the return statement was written in my
first patch between Greg and a fellow developer, so I wasn't sure who
to listen to. I was in the midst of changing jobs, so this didn't take
top priority.

Again, sorry, but I thank you for considering my patches.

Lisa
