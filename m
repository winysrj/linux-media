Please calm down. This, in fact, is not new vs old ioctl problem but
rather particular driver (or rather set of drivers) implementation
issue. Even if we drop the new ioctls and convert the RC code to use the
old ones you'd be observing the same breakage as RC code responds with
-EINVAL to not-yet-established mappings.

I'll see what can be done for these drivers; I guess we could supply a
fake KEY_RESERVED entry for not mapped scancodes if there are mapped
scancodes "above" current one. That should result in the same behavior
for RCs as before.
