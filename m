I the above mentioned capture card and the digital side of the card
works well.  However, when I try to get video from the analog side of
the card, all I get is a red screen and no sound regardless of channel
requested.  This is a problem I see in 2.6.39-rc1 though I typically
run the ubuntu 10.10 kernel with the newest drivers built from source.
 Is there something in setup or configuration that I may be missing?
