I totally second Mauro's concerns and proposal. My own proposal was
along the lines of:

	menu FOO
		hide if BAR

but obviously the idea is the same, so it doesn't matter which of the 3
proposals gets implemented. The basic idea is to have a weak form of
"depends" for menus, which hides the menu from the user but preserves
all the symbols defines under that menu.

Michal, is the above something you would be able to implement in
Kconfig?
