That makes it easier I wasn’t aware of this file thanks :)

Agreed the device tree is meant to describe the hardware, basically the the need
had arrived since the adv7343 is present on DM6467 EVM and also on the
OMAP-L138 EVM, the configuration of this two register's differs on these
two evm's mentioned, because of which this is now being passed as part of
the device tree.

OK

OK will do that.
