Subject: Siano DVB USB device called "Smart Plus"

I bought a USB DVB device in Brazil, but it doesn't work yet on my Linux system.

I've already documented it at:
http://linuxtv.org/wiki/index.php/Smart_Plus

The device works if I try to use it inside a VirtualBox virtual
machine running Windows.

I believe the kernel driver that claims this device does not actually
support it.


The device is called "USB 2.0 ISDB-T Stick", model UTV926 (according
to the manual), but I've also seen it mentioned as YS-926TV. USB
vendor:product is 187f:0202.


What can I do in order to make it work?
