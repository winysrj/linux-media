Thank you David

I'm following your clues

I've contacted Jarod Wilson (redhat), too. If it can be useful to the
list, bellow you can find his thoughts.

Thank you both!

Sergio

That driver isn't going to work, its written for lirc. You need a driver
written for the in-kernel IR subsystem. See drivers/media/rc/fintek-cir.c
and friends (iguanair.c, imon.c, winbond-cir.c, nuvoton-cir.c, etc).

Physical interface doesn't matter. The driver interfaces do. You'd have to
rewrite lirc_bbb to rc-core interfaces instead of lirc interfaces.
