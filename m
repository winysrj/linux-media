Doesn't that still pin the page?

Little confused why this is slow? So you fault the entire user MM into
your page tables at start of day and keep track of it with mmu
notifiers?

Well, the idea would be to not have the GPU block the other driver
beyond hinting that the page shouldn't be swapped out.

So, that won't work - you have the same issue as RDMA with work loads
like that.

If you can't somehow fence the hardware then pinning is the only
solution. Felix has the right kind of suggestion for what is needed -
globally stop the GPU, fence the DMA, fix the page tables, and start
it up again. :\

Right. The advantage of pinning is it tells the other stuff not to
touch the page and doesn't block it, MMU notifiers have to be able to
block&fence quickly.

Well, it isn't a software problem. From what I've seen in this thread
the GPU application requires coherent page table mirroring, so the
only full & complete solution is going to be to actually implement
that somehow in GPU hardware.

Everything else is going to be deeply flawed somehow. Linux just
doesn't have the support for this kind of stuff - and I'm honestly not
sure something better is even possible considering the hardware
constraints....

This doesn't have to be faulting, but really anything that lets you
pause the GPU DMA and reload the page tables.

You might look at trying to use the IOMMU and/or PCI ATS in very new
hardware. IIRC the physical IOMMU hardware can do the fault and fence
and block stuff, but I'm not sure about software support for using the
IOMMU to create coherent user page table mirrors - that is something
Linux doesn't do today. But there is demand for this kind of capability..
