I think no.

First, my patch should be on top of the following two patches, which 
changed the *v4l2_clk_get()* behavior:
[v3,1/2] V4L: remove clock name from v4l2_clk API
https://patchwork.linuxtv.org/patch/28108/
[v4,2/2] V4L: add CCF support to the v4l2_clk API
https://patchwork.linuxtv.org/patch/28111/

After applied above two patches, v4l2_clk_get() function is changed. The 
name "mclk" is refer to a CCF clock of the ov2640 device.
If not found such a "mclk" CCF clock, v4l2_clk_get() will try to get the 
internal register clock in soc_camera.c.
As the CCF dt clock is not support by ov2640 until I add DT support, 
that means current ov2640 driver will always not found the "mclk" CCF 
clock, and they will use internal clock.
So after I changed the name "mclk" to "xvclk", the default behavior will 
not change (still using internal clock registered by soc-camera.c).
