Afaik the google guys never really looked at this and acked it. So I'm not
sure whether they'll follow along. The other issue I have as the
maintainer of gfx driver is that I don't want to implement support for two
different sync object primitives (once for dma-buf and once for android
syncpts), and my impression thus far has been that even with this we're
not there.

I'm trying to get our own android guys to upstream their i915 syncpts
support, but thus far I haven't managed to convince them to throw people's
time at this.

It looks like a step into the right direction, but until I have the proof
in the form of i915 patches that I won't have to support 2 gfx fencing
frameworks I'm opposed to de-staging android syncpts. Ofc someone else
could do that too, but besides i915 I don't see a full-fledged (modeset
side only kinda doesn't count) upstream gfx driver shipping on android.
