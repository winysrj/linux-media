I really like that kind of input.

Especially for the follow up version, with dedicated antennas for each
transponder frequency. 

I do confirm, that it has the potential to replace two amplifiers, one
external and one on the card under bad reception conditions, not to talk
about the antenna itself and about what all that might cost else
installed by an expert on light-speed coming into your home ...

Not yet and hard to come by, also lots of different antennas and
amplification.
