Hello to the list.

I bought a generic SAA7130 based card from ebay a while back.  After
much research I have determined that it is an ITV-301.  I noticed in
searching the archives of this list that a patch was posted by Andre
Auzi a while back  but it doesn't appear that this card made it into the
current source.  I was wondering if anyone has a current build of the 
module that includes support for this device or perhaps can point me to 
a supported card in the list that works.

Thanks.
