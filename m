I don't want any timeouts in rc-core. There is just an IR packet that
starts optionally with a reset and ends with a timeout bit.
I have also nothing against renaming reset/timeout to start/stop.

rc-core really shouldn't care about consistent pulse/space ordering.
Its lirc that needs it.

Also in the future I think I should make the
ir_raw_event_store_with_filter the default submit function for all
drivers, and then I could drop that silly '_with_filter" thing
(Couldn't think for a better name for this function...)

Of course, nothing against that.
