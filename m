Unfortunately _ALL_ the usb DVB devices are unavailable if you do not
enable IR_CORE "Infrared remote controller adapters" in v4l.  This is
a little annoying as the usb device I use doesn't even have IR
capabilities.  It doesn't seem like something that should be forced on
the user -- enable IR or you can't even compile the driver you need,
which doesn't even use IR.

It's not the end of the world but I don't particularly appreciate the
enable-everything approach.  It would be nice to at least have the
option to trim the fat if you want.. Isn't that partially what Linux
is supposed to be about in the first place?

Just my two cents...
