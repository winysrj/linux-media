I just got one of these the other day and I was wondering if anyone
has looked at it.  It will take HDMI, component and composite input
plus stereo.  I have a picture I can post somewhere of the board.  It
has 3 main chips.

AD9985A - Component/composite input?
SIL9013CLU - Audio input?
TM6202 - HDMI input

I'm not sure if this falls under v4l since it has no tuner or dvb
since it captures digital video.

James
