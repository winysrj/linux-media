Subject: [PATCH 0/2] media: entity: add operation to help map DT node to media pad

Hi,

This small series add a new entity operation which will aid capture 
drivers to map a port/endpoint in DT to a media graph pad. I looked 
around and in my experience most drivers assume the DT port number is 
the same as the media pad number.

This might be true for most devices but there are cases where this 
mapping do not hold true. This series is implemented support to the 
ongoing ADV748x work by Kieran Bingham, [1]. In his work he have a 
driver which registers more then one subdevice. So when a driver finds 
this subdevice it must be able to ask the subdevice itself which pad 
number correspond to the DT endpoint the driver used to bind subdevice 
in the first place.

I have updated my R-Car CSI-2 patch series to use this new function to 
ask it's subdevice to resolve the media pad.

  media: entity: Add pad_from_dt_regs entity operation
