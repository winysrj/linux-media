A bit of shameless self-advertising :-)

It would have been clearer with the video, but it seems the talk hasn't been 
recorded :-/ There's also http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ja8fM7rTae4 that 
mostly focuses on the kernel side but starts with explanations of the key KMS 
concepts.

As far as KMS is concerned, libdrm is mostly a wrapper, so any documentation 
on the KMS ioctls can help too.
