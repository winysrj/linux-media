Of course, DIV_ROUND_UP is integer maths only too, as well as (almost) all 
maths in the kernel.

No, it doesn't look weird, I just wasn't sure, whether your maths would 
work in all situations. The only difference between yours and mine, is 
that yours rounds down, and mine rounds up. So, I'm not sure which one is 
better in this case.

No, you should be prepared to handle all possible crazy resolution 
requests.
