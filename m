Like wait.h I'd say. The main issue is wait.h uses TASK_* macros but
cannot properly include sched.h as it would create a circular
dependency. So a file including wait.h is able to compile because the
dependency of sched.h relies on wake_up*() macros and it's not always
used.
We can still drop everything else from task_state.h but the TASK_*
macros and then the problem you just pointed out won't exist anymore.
What do you think about it?
