Yeah, exactly what I said from the very beginning as well. Just hacking 
together quick solutions doesn't really solve the problem in the long term.

What we need is proper adjusting of the DMA API towards handling of P2P 
and then build solutions for the different use cases on top of that.

We should also avoid falling into the trap of trying to just handle the 
existing get_user_pages and co interfaces so that the existing code 
doesn't need to change. P2P needs to be validated for each use case 
individually and not implemented in workarounds with fingers crossed and 
hoped for the best.

Christian.
