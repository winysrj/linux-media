What concerns most is that we'll be adding yet-another-driver for the same
hardware, but using a different API set (Media controller + subdevs, instead
of pure V4L2).

It should be noticed that even basic stuff seems to be missing at the driver,
like proper locks[1].

[1] I'm basing my comments only at this patchset's TODO list - I didn't 
reviewed the code, but it this is one of the listed items: "Check proper
serialisation (through mutexes and spinlocks)"

As no regressions are accepted, on non-staging drivers, the switch from the
already working, stable one to the new one, when this driver reaches the
required quality, will be a very hard task, as one would need to check the
exact behavior of the existing driver, and check if the new driver will
behave the same, in order to warrant that no regressions will be introduced.

This doesn't sound something easy to do, especially if the implementation
decisions taken on the second driver aren't based on the same way as the
existing driver.

The risk is that this driver would never be merged upstream, due to those
conflicts, or that we'll take several years to solve it, before being
able to warrant that userspace binaries developed for the first driver
will work as-is with the new one.

Regards,
Mauro
