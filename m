The chip on  my card has been chemically wiped I think - there aren't any scratches or scrapes on it.  Despite my best efforts with multiple light sources, I still can't identify it.  In the meantime, I wrote to Kworld asking them to identify the chip in question, or to provide some kind of details allowing us to communicate with whatever device handles the remote control.  They responded a few days ago indicating that they would pass my request on to the engineering department.  That department has not responded yet.
