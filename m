Hi,

I am new here and start with a setup question.

The media or NAS server I think about: http://plugcomputer.org/

It has a high speed USB 2.0 port and a gigabit Lan.

Using Linux and VLC as the streaming server, would this be good for  =

streaming full HD videos from a attached USB hard drive?
The streaming client in mind: http://www.fit-pc.com/web/

Would it be possible to use this box (the cheapest one is about 299 =80  =

+ shipping in germany) with XBMC or other stuff?
I mean saving the hard drives in the client box when a SAN is used.  =

Both could use Linux and thus fully controlled and tweaked for best  =

performing as a media center solution.

The reason why I ask is because my brother want's to save money and  =

don't like to waste money for hardware components that may not really  =

needed.

Other devices in mind were these components:

en.html
http://www.tomsnetworking.de/content/aktuelles/news_beitrag/news/3828/index=
.html

But is there the opportunity to use the media from the movie cube to  =

be streamed to other computers?

Thanks for your help,

Lothar
