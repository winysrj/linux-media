Then why not use the correct interface? doing some sort of not-quite
generic interface isn't really helping anyone except adding an ABI
that we have to support.

If someone wants to bypass the current kernel APIs we should add a new
API for them not shove it into this generic buffer sharing layer.

How will you know the stride to take a simple example? The userspace
had to create this buffer somehow and wants to share it with
"something", you sound like
you really needs another API that is a simple accessor API that can
handle mmaps.

Again, doesn't sound like it should be part of this API, and also
sounds like the sw jpeg encoder will need more info about the buffer
anyways like stride and format.

So I think thats fine, write a sw accessor providers, don't go
overloading the buffer sharing code.

This API will limit what people can use this buffer sharing for with
pure hw accessors, you might say, oh buts its okay to fail the mmap
then, but the chances of sw handling that I'm not so sure off.
