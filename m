Ok, I think I see a way to hook this into timestamps from the skbuf on=20
incoming frames and a somewhat messy way on outgoing. Having time coupled=
=20
with 'avail' and 'delay' is useful, and from the looks of it, 'link'-time=
=20
is the appropriate level to add this.

I'm working on storing the time in the tsn_link struct I use, and then read=
=20
that from the avb_alsa-shim. Details are still a bit fuzzy though, but I=20
plan to do that and then see what audio-time gives me once it is up and=20
running.

Richard: is it fair to assume that if ptp4l is running and is part of a PTP=
=20
domain, ktime_get() will return PTP-adjusted time for the system? -Or do I=
=20
also need to run phc2sys in order to sync the system-time to PTP-time? Note=
=20
that this is for outgoing traffic, Rx should perhaps use the timestamp=20
in skb.

Hooking into ktime_get() instead of directly to the PTP-subsystem (if that=
=20
is even possible) makes it a lot easier to debug when running this in a VM=
=20
as it doesn't *have* to use PTP-time when I'm crashing a new kernel :)

Thanks!
