Hi Hans,

Thanks for the advice. When I say non/conflicting I'm referring to devices that work out of the box. I mean I install the card and the v4l library and it begins working, remote included. I don't want to have to spend weeks of banging my head and recompiling source to get it to work. I've seen a lot of wintv and/or Hauppauge cards for sale but I want to be sure that the device works with the remote in Linux.

Thanks,
John

Define non-conflicting, if that means with opensource drivers for 2d and 3d and 
supported by the vendor, I currently would advice an ati x1950pro, you need a 
very recent cutting edge distro for this (like Fedora 9 + updates) but then it 
works well. and 100 % FOSS

Regards,

Hans
