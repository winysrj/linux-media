Are you concerned about actual heaps (e.g. a carveout at 0x80000000 vs
a carveout at 0x60000000) or heap types?

For heap types, I think the policy can be strict - if it's generally
useful then it should live in-tree in ion. Otherwise, it would be
out-of-tree. I'd expect most "custom" heaps to be parameterisable to
the point of being generally useful.

For actual heap instances, I would expect them to be communicated via
reserved-memory regions or something similar, and so the maintenance
burden is pretty low.

The existing query ioctl can allow heap IDs to get assigned
dynamically at runtime, so there's no need to reserve "bit 6" for
"CUSTOM_ACME_HEAP_1"

I might be thinking of a different type of "secure", but...

Should the security of secure heaps be enforced by OS-level
permissions? I don't know about other architectures, but at least on
arm/arm64 this is enforced in hardware; it doesn't matter who has
access to the ion heap, because only secure devices (or the CPU
running a secure process) is physically able to access the memory
backing the buffer.

In fact, in the use-cases I know of, the process asking for the ion
allocation is not a secure process, and so we wouldn't *want* to
restrict the secure heap to be allocated from only by secure
processes.
