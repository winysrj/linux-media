Toth,

from profound resources I do know that you personally do not know anything 
about what excesses your highly specific card knowledge, which definitely does 
not even touch Empia devices at least superficially.

In other words:
Your personal voice counts absolutely NOTHING as far as the discussed issue is 
concerned.

I would personally suggest you to volunteer as ordinary soldier for 
Afghanistan sitting in the first row. This is the perfect place of getting rid 
of small brained reactionary people like you, isn't it?

I decide to keep for me what I think about your physiognomy that can be seen 
on a photograph shot after a Linux conference somewhere in the US.....
You can call that a rest of politeness.......
I am not use to people like you in the open source movement, if not to say:
I do regard you personally as a displaced impurity.

> This is not the first time people have had to say this.

The authoritarian character (if not to say fascistoid character) described in 
the studies of Theodor Adorno tends very often to use "we" or "people" instead 
of using the "I".
This is a proof that the accordant person was kept down from the beginning of 
childhood, trained to function like a robot without any unsuppressed attempt 
of thinking freely. Characters of that rather distorted kind very often (but 
not always) become cops or soldiers as profession to earn their living.

You will not help Mauro in his displaced position anyway, Toth! 
Lessons @ Richard Stallman would possibly help, although I am not too 
optimistic in your case to be honest......

> You're only damaging your reputation further using tactics like this.

This is what I call a (stupid) boomerang.
Psychologists would call that a "projection".

The truth about you, Toth, is that you yourself do not only damage your 
personal reputation by helping reactionary people like Mauro Chehab to betray 
the open source philosophy in its deepest essence.

But in fact you show that you are a mismatch as far as human qualifications are 
concerned.
