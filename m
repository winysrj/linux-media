I suggest (though I might not have been clear on that point) that irrcv 
devices create a char node...ir specifics are handled via that node 
(with read/write/ioctl...see the other mail I just send).

The entire idea is to have a common API for hardware decoders and 
decoders which provide raw pulse/space timings. That, to me, is one of 
the major points of having in-kernel IR decoders - being able to provide 
a consistent interface for both hardware decoders and pulse/space 
hardware.

And I do not think that sounds like a good interface.

Not really relevant...that's just the minor detail of how a sysfs file 
might be represented.

I think we can create an interface which obscures the differences:

Software decoders will export all in-kernel IR decoders in a bitmask in 
the "supported_protocols" sysfs file or ioctl struct member.

Hardware decoders will export the hardware supported protocol(s) in the 
same file/member.

In addition, a sysfs file or ioctl member for "enabled_protocols" will 
control either the enabled in-kernel IR decoders or hardware decoder(s).



As should be quite obvious by now...I suggest ioctls (on a irrcv 
specific chardev) for controlling this :)
