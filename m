I fear this will be confusing for subdevs, as they would have to
implement part of the operation.

Could it be that the subdev has_route operation isn't the best API for
the job, if it gets that complex ? I wonder if it would be easier to
create another operation that takes a pad index as argument, and returns
the list of pads (possibly as a bitmask ?) or connected pads.
media_entity_has_route() could easily be implemented on top of that, and
these new semantics may be easier for subdevs to implement.

I think that's the worst of both worlds from a subdev point of view :-)
