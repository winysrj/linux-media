Andrew,
Due to the the dependencies with the above patches, it seems better if you
could send this patch upstream together with the above patches.

A good documentation is a really good idea here. There videobuf internals are
very complex. A good documentation for it is very important to keep it updated.

I would also suggest if you could also take a look at videobuf-vmalloc and implement a
similar method to provide USERPTR. The vmalloc flavor can easily be tested with
the virtual (vivi) video driver, so it helps people to better understand how
videobuf works. It will also help the USB drivers that use videobuf to use USERPTR.



Cheers,
Mauro
