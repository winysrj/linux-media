Keep in mind that those virtual devices are created by PHY driver bound to 
a real device and one real device can have multiple virtual devices behind 
it.

Yes, in regulator core consumer names are completely separated from this. 
Regulator core simply assigns a sequential integer ID to each regulator 
and registers /sys/class/regulator/regulator.ID for each regulator.

The tag alone is not a key. Lookup key consists of two components, 
consumer device name and consumer tag. What kind of duplicate tags can be 
a problem here?
