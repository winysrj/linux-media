Webcam drivers can rely on i2c sensor drivers to handle the sensor. These
sensor drivers can be used in other non-USB devices as well (particularly
embedded SoC devices). Moving webcam drivers out of the kernel would likely
mean that you end up with duplicate kernel and userspace sensor drivers.
Not a good idea.

In all fairness I have to say that most webcam drivers program the
sensor directly instead of relying on an i2c driver. Often because they
were reverse engineered. But I know of several that should really be split
into a webcam driver and a separate i2c sensor driver.

Video hardware tends to rely heavily on i2c devices hooked up to them. The
big advantage of keeping everything in the kernel is that that makes i2c
driver sharing between USB, PCI, SoC, etc. much easier. Video hardware
also often has to toggle between different modes or functionalities (e.g.
analog TV vs DVB, MPEG encoded video vs raw). Having all components in the
kernel makes this a much easier job.

I think the approach favored by Hans de Goede is the right one based on what
I've read.

Whatever solution is chosen, in no way should that ever force us to duplicate
i2c sensor control in userspace. This would completely defeat all our efforts
to make sensor drivers reusable between webcams and SoCs.
