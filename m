In those other cases, presumably there is no platform data associated
with the PHY since it isn't a platform device.  Then how does the
kernel know which controller is attached to the PHY?  Is this spelled
out in platform data associated with the PHY's i2c/spi/whatever parent?

I don't understand, because I don't know what "a PHY lookup" does.

No, that's not what I said.  Neither the PHY driver nor the controller
driver exports anything to the other.  Instead, both drivers use data
exported by the board file.

You're right; the scheme was too simple.  Instead, the board file must
export two types of data structures, one for PHYs and one for
controllers.  Like this:

struct phy_info {
	/* Info for the controller attached to this PHY */
	struct controller_info	*hinfo;
};

struct controller_info {
	/* Info for the PHY which this controller is attached to */
	struct phy_info		*pinfo;
};

The board file for SoC A would contain:

struct phy_info phy1 = {&host1);
EXPORT_SYMBOL(phy1);
struct controller_info host1 = {&phy1};
EXPORT_SYMBOL(host1);

The board file for SoC B would contain:

struct phy_info phy1 = {&host2);
EXPORT_SYMBOL(phy1);
struct controller_info host2 = {&phy1};
EXPORT_SYMBOL(host2);

And so on.  This explicitly gives the connection between PHYs and
controllers.  The PHY providers would use &phy1 or &phy2, and the PHY
consumers would use &host1 or &host2.
