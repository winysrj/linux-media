There are two drivers here:

i810

i830

The i830 case is the case I care less about since the ABI is only used
by older userspace and i915 provides a replacement.

the i810 case ABI is still in use today by distro userspaces that are
still released, i.e. i810 is still used in F14, Ubuntu 10.10, RHEL6
Beta etc.

I've snipped the rest of the argument on the grounds you are
conflating two cases that aren't the same.

So we can drop i830 using deprecation, however its pointless since the
fix for i810 is the same fix for i830 if we can work out the fix.

Well the way to do it correctly is make it so if the driver is
initialised and we do an SMP transition we warn the users, or we make
BROKEN_ON_SMP into a runtime thing that warns when the driver is
loaded on an SMP system. The intersection of SMP and this hardware is
definitely a very very small number and a lot more workable.
