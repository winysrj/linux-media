Hmmm. That control is used to configure RF filters. Filters set 
bandwidth of radio channel. There is usually quite limited set of 
available analog filters inside RF tuner. If you look for example 
FC0012/FC0013 possible filters are 6/7/8 MHz. E4000 has something 4-11 
MHz. If you look those very old 1st gen silicon tuners like QT1010 / 
MT2060, there is no integrated filters at all - but there is external 
saw filter which is usually 8MHz at 36.125 MHz IF.

Did you remember there is same parameter already in DVB API (struct 
dtv_frontend_properties bandwidth_hz)? That is control is currently used 
to set r820t, fc0012, fc10013 .bandwidth_hz value, e4000 implements it 
correctly as own control.

I am quite astonished we have that big gap with our views.
