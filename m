Yes, mention those as you never want to be calling __* functions
directly, right?

No, who cares about the id?  No one outside of the phy core ever should,
because you pass back the only pointer that they really do care about,
if they need to do anything with the device.  Use that, and then you can
rip out all of the "search for a phy by a string" logic, as that's not
needed either.  Just stick to the pointer, it's easier, and safer that
way.

I still don't understand.  You have control over the code that calls
these functions, just ensure that they pass in a valid pointer, it's
that simple.  Or am I missing something?
