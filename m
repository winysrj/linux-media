oh, no, don't think replacing msleep(1) with msleep(20) just to silence a 
compiler warning is a god idea...;) Well, use a udelay(1000). Or maybe 
try, whether a udelay(100) suffices too.

If I understand your sensor correctly, HSTRT etc. registers configure 
pretty much any (input) sensor window, whereas COMA and COML select 
whether to scale it to a CIF or to a QCIF output. So, these are two 
different things. Hence your ->rect can hold only one of the two - the 
sensor window or the output image. Since output image has only two options 
- CIF or QCIF, you don't need to store it in rect, you already have 
priv->qcif.


Oh, and one more thing - didn't notice before: in your cropcap you do

+	int shift = !priv->qcif;
...
+	a->bounds.left			= DEF_HSTRT << shift;
+	a->bounds.top			= DEF_VSTRT << shift;
+	a->bounds.width			= W_QCIF << shift;
+	a->bounds.height		= H_QCIF << shift;

Don't think this is right. cropcap shouldn't depend on any dynamic 
(configured by S_FMT) setting, it contains absolute limits of your 
hardware. I know I might have produced a couple of bad examples in the 
past - before I eventually settled with this definition... So, I think, 
it's best to put the full sensor resolution in cropcap.

...and, please, replace

+		priv->qcif = 1;
with
+		priv->qcif = true;
and
+		priv->qcif = 0;
with
+		priv->qcif = false;
in ov6650_s_fmt().

But I think your driver might have a problem with its cropping / scaling 
handling. Let's see if I understand it right:

1. as cropcap you currently return QCIF or CIF, depending on the last 
S_FMT, but let's say, you fix it to always return CIF.

2. in your s_fmt you accept only two output sizes: CIF or QCIF, that's ok, 
if that's all you can configure with your driver.

3. in s_crop you accept anything with left + width <= HSTOP and top + 
height <= VSTOP. This I don't understand. Your HSTOP and VSTOP are fixed 
values, based on QCIF plus some offsets. So, you would accept widths up to 
"a little larger than QCIF width" and similar heights. Then, without 
changing COMA and COML you assume, that the output size changed equally, 
because that's what you return in g_fmt.

Anyway, I think, there is some misunderstanding of the v4l2 cropping and 
scaling procedures. Please, have a look here: 
http://v4l2spec.bytesex.org/spec/x1904.htm. Do you agree, that what your 
driver is implementing doesn't reflect that correctly?;)
