Subject: [PATCH 0/4] Add managed token devres interfaces and change media drivers to use it 
Date: Tue, 29 Apr 2014 13:49:22 -0600

Media drivers that control a single media TV stick are a
diversified group. Analog and digital TV function drivers have
to coordinate access to their shared functions. In some cases,
snd-usb-audio is used to support audio function on media devices.

A shared managed resource framework at drivers/base level will
allow a media device to be controlled by drivers that don't
fall under drivers/media and share functions with other media
drivers.

A token devres that can be looked up by a token for locking, try
locking, unlocking will help avoid adding data structure
dependencies between various drivers. This token is a unique
string that can be constructed from a common data structure such as
struct device, bus_name, and hardware address.

This patch series adds devm_token_* interfaces to manage access to
token resource and a tuner token to allow sharing tuner function
across analog and digital functions. em28xx and dvb-core make
use of this new tuner token to control tuner access. Analog changes
will be added in a subsequent patch series.

Patch series is tested with Kworld UB435-Q V3 USB TV stick and
Kaffeine media player.

Shuah Khan (4):
  drivers/base: add managed token devres interfaces
  media: dvb-fe changes to use token for shared access control
  media/em28xx: changes to create token for tuner access
  media: em28xx dvb changes to initialze dvb fe tuner token
