Yes.  I like to keep hard IRQ handler durations as short as possible. 

This CX2388[58] PCIe IRQ is raised not only for IR, but for the rest of
the bridge chip functions too.  The IR irq handling is just one of the
functions that may need service and video related functions are really
more important.

This Conexant IR hardware is used on the CX2388[58], CX23418,
CX2584[0123], and CX2310[123]. Right now I only have the driver
implemented for the CX23888 and a test implementation for the CX23885.
But I plan to have a somewhat common code base working for all the chips
eventually.  I think it is better to go with a slightly more complicated
handoff for reading IR pulses with a deferred work handler, than to
degrade the hard IRQ handler peformance for all of these drivers.  The
CX23418 is really a pain about it's IRQ handler timeline.


BTW, the ns unit of resolution we have in the kernel so far is likely
due to me.  I have hardware that can report measurements with a
resolution of (2 * 4)/108MHz = 74 ns, so I just settled on ns as the
basic time unit.  I think it's overkill too for existing protocols.  It
is however nice for measuring and characterizing noise in the
environment (something that an enduser will never need) or investigating
an unknown protocol.
