Yes, I believe the camera violates the spec.

What bulk URB size did Windows use ?

I don't think it uses the FID, as that requires the presence of a header, 
which is only present at the beginning of payloads, and thus require the 
driver to be able to detect the payload in the first place.

With the three USB traces I've received so far for your camera it seems that 
we could detect the end of a payload by a short URBs. Maybe that's what 
Windows does. This would however probably break if the MJPEG data size + 
header size happens to be a multiple of 16kB.

Have you looked at the YUYV capture traces ? What's the data pattern there ? I 
would expect the last 14 bytes transfer not to be present for YUYV. Does the 
camera use a single payload in that case as well ?
