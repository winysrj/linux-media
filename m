There is some commonality with Zach's work, but Zach should be following
all of this development .. So presumably he has no issues with Michal's
changes. I think Zach's solution has a similar direction to this.

If Michal is active (he seems more so than Zach), and follows community
comments (including Zach's , but I haven't seen any) then we can defer
to that solution ..
