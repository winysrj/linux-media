I haven't decided yet, but probably I won't.

When I wrote my patch on the top of Laurent's one, I tested it, with both
analog TV and composite input, and didn't notice any issue. I used a
WinTV USB2 and HVR-950.

I didn't test with progressive video input though, as I'm using a PVR-350
TV out to generate signals, with, AFIKT, generates only interlaced video.

Unfortunately, analog TV signal broadcast ended last month, and I don't
have any analog TV RF generator. I might still have an old VCR with a
RF output, but need to check if it is on my garage.

That shouldn't affect anything. The .set_fmt() callback is only called by
drivers/media/v4l2-core/v4l2-subdev.c. As those devices don't use
subdevs, removing tvp5150_reset() from tvp5150_fill_fmt() shouldn't
affect anything.

Such patch is authored by Javier. He probably forgot to sign it.

Javier should explain it more, but I guess it is meant to switch between
NTSC and PAL.

The way it is, it worked on my past test scenarios. As I explained before, 
testing right now is more complex, as I lack progressive video output and
analog TV RF output.

I could try to setup an environment to test it, but it could take some
time to find the needed gadgets.
 
Thanks,
