According to latest NorDig specification, page 39
http://www.nordig.org/pdf/NorDig-Unified_ver_2.5.1.pdf
there is two kind of reports, basic and advanced. Normal report is (%) 
which suits well for relative scale.

The basic status check shall include:
* channel id, according to Annex B.2
* centre frequency
* Signal Strength Indicator, SSI (%), according to section 3.4.4.6
* Signal Quality Indicator, SQI (%), according to section 3.4.4.7


The terrestrial NorDig IRD should provide an advanced status check 
function (accessible through the Navigator) that presents the following 
information:
* channel id, according to Annex B.2
* centre frequency
* signal strength (dBm or dBÎ¼V)
* signal strength indicator, SSI (%), according to section 3.4.4.6
* signal quality indicator, SQI (%), according to section 3.4.4.7
* C/N (dB)
* BER before Reed Solomon decoding (DVB-T) or BCH decoding (DVB-T2)
* Uncorrected packets
