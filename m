I have 4 of these tuners, 3 of them are the 24xx series and 1 is a 29xx 
series, at one time they all worked great and I am not sure what happened to 
cause this but at some point the 29xx tuner started outputting black and white 
video. At first I suspected a hardware failure and thought maybe it was in the 
analog tuner part of the card so I switched it over to using the composite 
side but this didn't help. As a last resort to chalking it up as a failed 
piece of hardware I tried it on a windows machine and it works fine there so I 
am under the impression that this must be a driver/firmware issue. Since my 
other 3 tuners don't have a problem I assume that there must be some part of 
the driver/firmware that only affects the 29xx series cards and the problem lies 
within this, I have no idea where to look for a solution, any help would be 
appreciated.
