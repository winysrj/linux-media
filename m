I'm not sure how much sense this makes. Imo the importer side is rather
clearly spelled out, everything else is only now shaping up. And even with
the clear interface spec we pretty much have no in-tree dma_buf user who
doesn't cut corners somewhere for one or the other reason. As long the set
of exporters is fairly limited we should be fine for now.
