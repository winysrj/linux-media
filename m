I'm adding this here as a result of an irc discussion, since it applies
to both encoders and decoders:

How to handle non-square pixel aspect ratios?

Decoders would have to report it through VIDIOC_CROPCAP, so this needs
to be documented when the application should call this, but I don't
think we can provide this information today for encoders.

Regards,
