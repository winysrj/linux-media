Hi,

may I humbly request to make it mandatory to enter a description
when a user creates a new tree on linuxtv.org?
IMHO "foobar development repository" isn't useful at all.

If I look at http://linuxtv.org/hg/ many times I have no
clue what a repo is about or why it exists at all.
Let's not repeat the same mistake with git.

OTOH, since with git it is common to have multiple branches
within one repository, I'm not sure how it works. It would
be cool if git would support per-branch descriptions,
and git web could display them.


Johannes
