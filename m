KernelLabs is not a collections of politicians who want to change the 
world together whatever the costs. We are professional individuals in 
our decisions and views. 

I think it's better to limit public discussions in a professional 
technical environment to technical problems - saying that I would want 
to encourage you discuss with us off-list or in our blog what makes you 
generalize in such a way?
