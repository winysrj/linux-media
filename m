For what it's worth, something seems very wrong with this patch.  All
the docs I've ever seen for the Xceive components were pretty clear
that the signal level registers are for analog only.  And even in te
case of Xceive it's a bit unusual, since most analog tuner designs
don't have an onboard analog demodulator.

If this patch really works then I guess I don't have anything against
it.  I just strongly believe that it's the wrong fix and there is
probably some other problem this is obscuring.
