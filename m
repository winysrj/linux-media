The patch in that thread would have broken things since the
store_protocol function is not changed at the same time. The patch I
sent also takes that into account.

My concern is still that user space behaviour changes.
In my case, lirc simply does not work anymore. More generically,
anyone now using e.g. nuvoton-cir with anything other than RC6_MCE
will not get their devices working without first explictly enabling
the correct protocol from sysfs or with ir-keytable.

Correct me if I'm wrong but the change_protocol function in struct
rc_dev is meant for changing hardware decoder protocols which means
only a few drivers actually use it. So the added empty function
change_protocol into rc-ir-raw.c doesnt really make sense in the first
place.
