No, not at all. The devices are ready to handle everything when they are
created, it's just some devices are not there yet. What you do with
current udev rule is similar to trying to mount filesystem as soon as
you discover a PCI SCSI card. The controller is there but disks have not
been discovered, block devices have not been created, and so on.

I belie you have been copied on the mail that had the following snippet:

That should be done by the separate utility that fires up when udev gets
event for /sys/class/rc/rcX device.

And this could be easily added to the udev's keymap utility that is
fired up when we discover evdevX devices.

The same issue is present with other types of input devices (multimedia
keyboards emitting codes that X can't consume) and so it again would
make sense to enhance udev's utility instead of confining it all to
ir-keytable.

Thanks.
