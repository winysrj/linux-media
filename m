Actually, it is allowed, but only since kernel 2.6.29 (before that it could
apparently give rise to busy looping if you were unlucky). But the main use
case is userspace file systems like fuse. Not so much in regular drivers.

Since drivers can sleep when starting streaming (ivtv will do that, in any
case), we were in violation of the poll kernel API for a long time :-)

There is actually no guarantee whatsoever that if poll says you can read(), that that
read also has to succeed. Other threads can have read the data already, and errors may
have occured. And in fact, just starting streaming gives no guarantee that there is
anything to read. For example, starting the DMA engine when there is no valid input
signal. Many drivers (certainly those dealing with digital interfaces as opposed to
analog) will just sit and wait. A non-blocking read will just return 0 without
reading anything.

So the current poll implementation (and that includes the one in videobuf-core.c as
well) actually does *not* give any guarantee about whether data will be available
in read().

And from the same POSIX link you posted:

"The poll() function shall support regular files, terminal and pseudo-terminal devices,
FIFOs, pipes, sockets and [XSR] [Option Start]  STREAMS-based files. [Option End]
The behavior of poll() on elements of fds that refer to other types of file is unspecified."

Note the last line: we do not fall under this posix document.

There isn't a problem with mmap(). For the stream I/O API you have to call STREAMON
explicitly in order to start streaming. poll() will not do that for you.

I was thinking that one improvement that could be realized is that vb2_poll could
do some basic checks, such as checking whether streaming was already in progress
(EBUSY), but then I realized that it already does that: this code is only active
if there is no streaming in progress anyway.
