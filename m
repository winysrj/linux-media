Hi Matthias,

since I know you are active also on saa713x devices,
have you seen it there, on 32 or 64bit ?

It seems to be restricted to cx88 and risc memory there for now?

It did not hit me for now on 32, could test on 64 too with some
inconvenience.

For me it looks like going out of the subsystem is not very safe
recently, but I don't blame anyone who tried it, assuming we'll have
some ground again soon.

To send further patches on top of it, is of course not he best idea
currently.

Cheers,
Hermann
