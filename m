Greetings ...

 I was wondering if anybody has looked at the Syntek Driver stk11xx at
http://sourceforge.net/projects/syntekdriver/files/ ... This driver is
meant to have updates for the EasyCap USB video capture device ...
Would be great to have included in the main line Video4Linux and then
up stream Kernel ... Pretty please!!

Mailed

P.S. Hans de Goede suggested I post here ...
