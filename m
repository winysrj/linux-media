Hello,

I'm owning an Elgato EyeTV hybrid USB stick that I'm using daily on my
iMac, now I'd like to use it on my laptop too but I'm unable to get it
running. Is this device already supported? If not, is there any way I
can help? I've already opened my device and uploaded the photos to the
linux TV wiki page
(http://www.linuxtv.org/wiki/index.php/Elgato_EyeTV_hybrid).
I'm not sure which tuner is mounted on the PCB, therefor I've made two
USB traces, maybe someone could interpret them and conclude which one
is used:
