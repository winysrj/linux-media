It will remove handling of the format in vb2 (even if it's a pass-through 
operation). I think it would be cleaner that way. It will also avoid going 
back and forth between drivers and vb2, which would improve code readability.

Guennadi's patch will (at least in my opinion) be cleaner if built on top of 
queue_setup() removal.
