Ah, OK. Got it.

I think this is dependent on the upcoming media workshop next month. If we
decide to redesign v4l2_buffer anyway, then we can avoid timeval completely.
And the only place where we would need to convert it in the compat code
hidden in the v4l2 core (likely v4l2-ioctl.c).

I am not really keen on having v4l2_timeval in all these drivers. I would
have to check them anyway since I suspect that in several drivers the local
timeval variable can be avoided by rewriting that part of the driver.

Personally I am in favor of a redesigned v4l2_buffer: it's awkward to use
with multiplanar formats, there is cruft in there that can be removed (timecode),
and there is little space for additions (HW-specific timecodes, more buffer
meta data, etc).

We'll see.
