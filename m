Hmm, sorry, I don't follow...

The port numbers should be fixed for a particular device. If the device
has 4 input ports, the output port would always be port@4, no matter how
many of the input ports are actually used.

I don't have anything against having the ports described in the SoC
dtsi. But I do think it may make it a bit unclear that the ports are
from the same device, and share things like pinmuxing. Both approaches
should work fine, afaics.

However, if, instead, we could have the pinmuxing and other relevant
information in the port or endpoint nodes, making the ports independent
of each other and of the device behind them, I argument above would
disappear.

Also, while I'm all for making the dts files clear, I do think the one
writing the dts still needs to go carefully through the binding docs.
Say, a device may need a gpio list with a bunch of gpios. The developer
just needs to read the docs and know that gpio #3 on the list is GPIO_XYZ=
=2E

So I don't see it as a major problem that the board developer needs to
know that port@1 on OMAP3's DSS is SDI output.

Hmm, why wouldn't you have the pinctrl definitions in the ports 0 and 1,
then, if it's about selecting the active input pins?

I think the pinctrl framework could offer ways to have pinctrl
definitions anywhere in the DT structure. It'd be up to the driver to
point to the pinctrl in the DT, ask the framework to parse them, and
eventually enable/disable the pins.

But yes, it's a bit out of scope =3D).
