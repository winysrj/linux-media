The email thread is not registered at git logs nor at the API spec.

The real problem I'm seeing here is that this control is already
used by voice coil motor (VCM). Several UVC-based Logitech cameras
come with VCM, like their QuickCam Pro-series webcams:

	https://secure.logitech.com/en-hk/articles/3231

The voice coil can be seen on this picture:

> Additionally, increasing the current brings the focus closer, not farther.

That's just a hardware/software implementation detail. One could use
a voice coil to do just the reverse: without any current, it would
be getting a minimal focus distance; with max current it would
go to infinite, or may have some firmware inside the hardware that
would be inverting the signal.

I have here a C920 camera. This model has V4L2_CID_FOCUS_ABSOLUTE:

ioctl(3, VIDIOC_G_EXT_CTRLS, {ctrl_class=V4L2_CTRL_CLASS_CAMERA, count=1, controls=[{id=V4L2_CID_FOCUS_ABSOLUTE, size=0, value=0, value64=0}]}) = 0
write(1, "                 focus_absolute "..., 97                 focus_absolute (int)    : min=0 max=250 step=5 default=0 value=0 flags=inactive

On this model, V4L2_CID_FOCUS_ABSOLUTE == infinite.

On a quick check at uvc driver, it seems that the driver itself
doesn't invert the value before sending to the device. So, 
I guess that, either the camera firmware do something like:
	current = 250 - control_value
Or the VCM here is mounted, in hardware, to use less current
when focusing on a close object.

Looking on it on another side, this control was added on this changeset:

    commit f9bd5843658e18a7097fc7258c60fb840109eaa8

    V4L/DVB (7167): [v4l] Add camera class control definitions

Meant to be used on USB cameras. Until this changeset:

	[media] ad5820: Add driver for auto-focus coil

The only driver that were using it were uvcvideo.

As far as I remember, Brandon was working together with a Logitech
developer, in order to add support for those Quickcam Pro cameras.
So, what this control actually sets is the VCM.

That's why I don't see any need to add another control to do the same
thing.

Hmm... if the idea is to have a control that doesn't do ringing
compensation, then it should be clear at the control's descriptions
that:

- V4L2_CID_FOCUS_ABSOLUTE should be used if the VCM has ringing
  compensation;
- V4L2_CID_VOICE_COIL_CURRENT and V4L2_CID_VOICE_COIL_RING_COMPENSATION
  should be used otherwise.

Btw, if the rationale for this patch is to support devices without
ring compensation, so, both controls and their descriptions should
be added at the same time, together with a patchset that would be
using both.

> How about adding such an explanation added to the commit message?

It is not enough. Documentation should be clear that VCM devices
with ring compensation should use V4L2_CID_FOCUS_ABSOLUTE.
