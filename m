Hello,

I'm trying to compile saa716x module for kernel 2.6.30 but I'm getting some 
errors. It seems that sources need to be adapted to latest kernel versions to 
work. I'm using code located at http://www.jusst.de/hg/saa716x/ (last change 
was three months ago).

Is there any patch to solve this problem?

Jonathan
