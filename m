The purpose of this patch is to add support for the gm7113c chip in the saa7115 driver.
The gm7113c chip is a chinese clone of the Philips/NXP saa7113 chip.
The chip is found in several cheap usb video capture devices.

This is the forth version of a patch-set previously posted by Mauro,
the first verson was posted on 26 April, and can be found here:

The second version was posted by Mauro on 26 April, and can be found here:
http://www.spinics.net/lists/linux-media/msg63087.html

The third version was posted by me on 29 April and had a bad cover-letter:
http://www.spinics.net/lists/linux-media/msg63163.html

This version has a better cover-letter and I've added a commit message to the last patch.
