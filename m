Does it mean that based on the V4L2 spec, the order of components in
memory is always guaranteed regardless of the endianness of the
underlying platform? Is it the Vivid/v4l2 core driver's responsibility
to make sure this happens?

This would only work if the alpha component A is always in the MSB
which suggests endianness-independence. And, what would happen when
writing the alpha mask 0x000000ff in a BE environment which would end up
as 0x00 0x00 0x00 0xff in memory?

Ok, should I send a patch adding support for VUYA format? Should the
new fourcc be VUY4?
