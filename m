Between two or more kernel drivers, a resource locking mechanism like the one 
you've proposed works fine, but, when the driver is on userspace, there's one
additional issue that needs to be addressed: What happens if, for example,
if a camera application using libgphoto2 crashes? The lock will be enabled, and
the V4L driver will be locked forever. Also, if the lock is made generic enough
to protect between two different userspace applications, re-starting the
camera application won't get the control back.

To avoid such risk, kernel might need to implement some ugly hacks to detect
when the application was killed, and put the device into a sane state, if this
happens.

Again, applications that won't implement this control will take the lock forever.
