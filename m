I hope you consider it again.
Usually, when the die temperature exceeds the specific temperature, ie 120 or 135 and fixed value,
turn off PFET,NFET, current sources and set TEMP Fault bit.
But in the NTC mode, the comparator is working and detect selected temperature through Vtrip value.
It protects shutdown the chip due to high voltage and keep the device operation.
Many flash chip support NTC and TEMP Fault both. For example, LM3554, LM3556, LM3559
LM3642, LM3646, LM3560, LM3561, LM3565 etc
Two things should be tell apart.

I agree with you.

IVFM is Input Voltage Flash Monitor.
If the flash chip has IVFM function the flash current can be adjusted based upon the voltage level of input.
As ramping flash current, the input voltage goes down and IVFM block adjust current to prevent to shudown due to low voltage
and keep the flash operation. So if the input voltage crossed the IVFM Threshold level chip set the fault bit.
Many flash chip, for example LM3556, LM3646, LM3642 , support this fucntion.
I think, V4L2_FLASH_FAULT_INPUT_VOLTAGE_MONITOR is better than V4L2_FLASH_FAULT_IVFM.
