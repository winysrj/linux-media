I don't have access to the documentation either, but I know
some designs that have multiple demods that are dynamically set.
Some hardware even allow to dynamically change the maximum amount
of filters per demod at runtime.

I suspect that doing it at the demod does a lot more sense.

Anyway, someone should come with a driver requiring it upstream
for us to discuss and find the better alternatives to support.

Thanks,
Mauro
