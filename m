That makes sense since few if any apps can handle FIELD_ALTERNATE.

What version of gstreamer are you using? Looking at the gstreamer code it
seems that it can handle ENOTTY at least since September last year. Not handling
ENOTTY is an application bug (there are other - rare - drivers that do not
have any controls) and as such I really don't like seeing a workaround like
this in a driver, especially since this seems like it should be working fine
with the latest gstreamer.
