Hello.

Regarding the Terratec Cinergy HT Express i was wondering if the analog tv, fm 
radio and digital radio have been supported (the DVBT is supposed to work 
according to several threads)?
Also, for reasons not important to present here, i am using a very old kernel 
2.6.22 so please state the minimum kernel version on which the above features 
are supported.

Thank you.
Regards.
