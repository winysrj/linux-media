Ooh, that approach would indeed provide a cleaner api for setting the
wakeup scancode. I like the idea though I haven't really had the
chance to try it out.

Yeah, I'm also inclined to target for a longer term solution with this
so the current patches can be reverted.

I think I now also have enough information to go and respin the
patches to utilize the new EVIOCSKEYCODE_V2 if and when that gets
included in the rc-core.
