Hi Clemens,

Thank you. Please see my comments inline.

What this type describes is a device node. Both NODE and DEVICE can be 
confusing in my opinion, but DEVICE_NODE is a bit long.

SUBDEV comes from the V4L2 world, and I agree that it might not be a very good 
name.

I'm not sure I would split entities in internal/external categories. I would 
create a category for connectors though.

Agreed.

I've been thinking of adding a new ioctl for that. It's something we need to 
draft. The UVC driver will need it, and I'm pretty sure other V4L2 drivers 
would find it useful as well.

Shouldn't headphones be represented by an EXT_JACK_ANALOG ?

There's clearly an overlap with V4L here. Hopefully someone from the linux-
media list can comment on this.

I'd describe this as a feature unit/processing unit then.

Some of those INT entities could also be implemented in dedicated chips, so I 
really think the EXT/INT split doesn't make too much sense. Should we have an 
AUDIO category ?

In V4L2 sub-devices have (or rather will have once the media controller 
patches will be integrated) device nodes as well, so exposing that information 
is required.

How would drivers do that ? What if you have two instances of the same chip (a 
video sensor, audio mixer, ...) on the same board ?

I will already incorporate this change, and I'll wait for other opinions on 
the types before changing them.
