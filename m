Implementing this makes the locking feel weird, instead of abusing
fence->event_queue.lock I think it would make sense to remove this part entirely,
and have a simply linked list plus a pointer to a spinlock.

enable_signaling should be called with this spinlock held. This way,
the enable_signaling callback would be easier to implement
and doesn't have to double check for races as much in there.

Also __fence_signal should be exported which would be the
same as fence_signal, but without taking the spinlock as separate
step, so it can be called with the spinlock held.

How do you feel about these proposed changes?
