This should be controller_pdev, not phy_pdev, yes?

Or even just phy_get(&pdev->dev), because phy_get() could be smart 
enough to to set phy = dev->platform_data.

That's what I was going to suggest too.  The struct phy is defined in
the board file, which already knows about all the PHYs that exist in
the system.  (Or perhaps it is allocated dynamically, so that when many
board files are present in the same kernel, only the entries listed in
the board file for the current system get created.)  Then the
structure's address is stored in the platform data and made available
to both the provider and the consumer.

Even though the struct phy is defined (or allocated) in the board file,
its contents don't get filled in until the PHY driver provides the
details.

You don't have to have a full definition in the board file.  Just a 
partial definition -- most of the contents can be filled in later, when 
the PHY driver is ready to store the private data.

It's not a layering violation for one region of the kernel to store 
private data in a structure defined by another part of the kernel.  
This happens all the time (e.g., dev_set_drvdata).
