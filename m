You're absolutely right. The logic is completely awkward. I'm currently
working on a new patch series that will clean up all the register
reading/writing functions to properly check i2c_transfer()'s return code.

Right now, I just have no idea. Right now, the overwhelming majority of
the cards we tested with a recent kernel (about 60 units) are working
just fine with the code as-is.

My main (if not sole) objective for now is to make it easier for us (but
hopefully for others too) to find defective cards/chips.

I'll first see how our units are behaving with the upcoming patches but
I'll definitely keep this in mind as a next step.

Thanks again,
