As we do almost every year, I'd like to propose a topic for a Media Summit
together with the Kernel Summit.

This year, we're actually planing to do it in two days, one
day for more internal matters (e. g. to review our patch handling
process), and the second day open to the general audience, in order to 
discuss technical matters (typically uAPI and kAPI changes, like
Request API and other changes needed to support media devices).


Thanks,
Mauro
