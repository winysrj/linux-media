Quite - but the match parent patch still hasn't got upstream yet either - so
it's still not supported.

I'd love to know if there are other devices with an ADV748x out there though!

Matching parent == parent will have the side effect that all devices with
multiple endpoints, will discover all endpoints successfully match on both
device comparisons.

Thus, this in effect will completely undo all endpoint matching efforts.
