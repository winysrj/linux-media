I prefer this. We can always remove the reprobe code later once we have
a better understanding. I see no downside to this cleanup series and it
doesn't block any future development.

I'm OK with this as well, we missed the 4.14 merge window anyway.

I'm uneasy about this as well.

Sorry, I don't understand this one.
