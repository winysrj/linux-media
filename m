Hi All,

Is anyone working on the WinTV Nova-S USB2 gizmo? I would like to get 
this device to work but need some pointers on where to start. I have it 
functioning on a VMWare session on Linux (but thats really not the 
solution :-P)

What I can tell from other Wiki pages is that it is a Trident TVMaster 
TM6000 based device with a Conexant_CX24109  Tuner.

Any pointers,
Richard
