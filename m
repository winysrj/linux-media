Sorry, I don't mean those specific Umlaut characters:-) I mean in general 
- here it's in German, next time we see it in Russian / cyrillic, then in 
Japanese / kanji, then in hebrew... See what I mean? :-) I certainly don't 
have anything against those languages as such, I myself switch between a 
couple of them all the time, but this specific line carries information, 
that should be understood by all on this list, IMHO. But well, maybe we'll 
just get used to it just as well as to "Am ... schrieb ..." etc:-) And I 
certainly realise that you (probably:-)) have nothing to do with this, 
rather git maintainers, anyway, enough rant for a Sunday evening:-)
