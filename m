Yes.
Your patch was nevertheless useful, because it pointed out further bugs
in em28xx_v4l2_open().
I've sent another RFC patch which should fix them, too.

Yes, I've tested the patch with the VAD Laplace webcam (ov2640), a
Hauppauge HVR 900 and a Terratec Cinergy 200.
Please note that the patch does not balance .s_power() calls perfectly,
it only makes sure that the subdevices are powered on when needed.
This also avoids the scary v4l2-clk warnings.
Due to the various GPIO sequences, I see no chance to make s_power calls
really balanced in such drivers.
