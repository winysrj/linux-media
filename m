OK.

OK, i've added these helper functions. In csi_link_validate() we don't
have the infmt handy, but as the downstream elements check if they have
a native format anyway, this check is redundant and so i've dropped it.

I just followed the existing code there, which already configures all
of these.

Yes, i've changed that for v2.

OK. :)
