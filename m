I think there is a confusion here about who registers the PHYs.

All platform code does is registering a platform/i2c/whatever device, 
which causes a driver (located in drivers/phy/) to be instantiated. Such 
drivers call phy_create(), usually in their probe() callbacks, so 
platform_code has no way (and should have no way, for the sake of 
layering) to get what phy_create() returns.

IMHO we need a lookup method for PHYs, just like for clocks, regulators, 
PWMs or even i2c busses because there are complex cases when passing just 
a name using platform data will not work. I would second what Stephen said 
[1] and define a structure doing things in a DT-like way.

Example;

[platform code]

static const struct phy_lookup my_phy_lookup[] = {
	PHY_LOOKUP("s3c-hsotg.0", "otg", "samsung-usbphy.1", "phy.2"),
	/* etc... */
};

static void my_machine_init(void)
{
	/* ... */
	phy_register_lookup(my_phy_lookup, ARRAY_SIZE(my_phy_lookup));
	/* ... */
}

/* Notice nothing stuffed in platform data. */

[provider code - samsung-usbphy driver]

static int samsung_usbphy_probe(...)
{
	/* ... */
		for (i = 0; i < PHY_COUNT; ++i) {
			usbphy->phy[i].name = "phy";
			usbphy->phy[i].id = i;
			/* ... */
			ret = phy_create(&usbphy->phy);
			/* err handling */
		}
	/* ... */
}

[consumer code - s3c-hsotg driver]

static int s3c_hsotg_probe(...)
{
	/* ... */
	phy = phy_get(&pdev->dev, "otg");
	/* ... */
}
