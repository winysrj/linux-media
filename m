There are three problems here

1. CMA can trigger the OOM killer.

That seems like overkill to me but as I do not know the consequences
of CMA failing, it's your call.

2. You cannot guarantee that try_to_free_pages will free pages from the
   zone you care about or that kswapd will do anything

You check the watermarks and take into account the size of the pending
CMA allocation. kswapd in vmscan.c on the other hand will simply check
the watermarks and probably go back to sleep. You should be aware of
this in case you ever get bugs that CMA takes too long and that it
appears to be stuck in this loop with kswapd staying asleep.

3. You reclaim from zones other than your target zone

try_to_free_pages is not necessarily going to free pages in the
zone you are checking for. It'll work on ARM in many cases because
there will be only one zone but on other arches, this logic will
be problematic and will potentially livelock. You need to pass in
a zonelist that only contains the zone that CMA cares about. If it
cannot reclaim, did_some_progress == 0 and it'll exit. Otherwise
there is a possibility that this will loop forever reclaiming pages
from the wrong zones.

I won't ack this particular patch but I am not going to insist that
you fix these prior to merging either. If you leave problem 3 as it
is, I would really like to see a comment explaning the problem for
future users of CMA on other arches (if they exist).
