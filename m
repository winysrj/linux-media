I have been trying to get my 2 HVR-1800's to work with my time-warner cable
box without much success at all.

Good thing I bought 2 of these, since they are exactly what I needed, and
can't use them at all except OTA, since there are lots of problem with the
analog input of these.

I am looking for a good analog capture card that can get S-video and maybe
audio from my TW box, so that I can use them in Mythtv.

Does anyone have any suggestions on what cards have analog S-video support?

Thanks!

-Mark
