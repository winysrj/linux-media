Well, the idea is not to cancel all callbacks, but just a single one, in
case a driver wants to somehow abort the wait. E.g. when the own gpu dies
I guess we should clear all these fence callbacks so that they can't
clobber the hw state after the reset.

Well, as-is the api works differently than all the other _timeout apis
I've seen in the kernel, which makes it confusing. Also, I don't quite see
what jiffies wraparound issue there is?

This request here has the same reasons, essentially: If we offer a
dma_fence wait api that matches the usual wait apis closely, it's harder
to get their usage wrong. I know that i915 has some major cludge for a
wait_seqno interface internally, but that's no reason to copy that
approach ;-)
