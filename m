Hi Steve, when you said this is not a feature Hauppauge supports.
Did you mean it's not fully enabled physically in the PCB...
Or is it just something they need to add support for in the driver?
If the latter do you know if their policy has changed or is about to?

Assuming that progress has been made on analogue to
h.263/mpeg4/VC-1/DivX/Xvid via the A/V-in encoder.
Is this still considered a low priority?

Has progress been made on hw encode via A/V-in?
I'm "finally" putting my entire system together soon, can't wait!
Looking forward to seeing how everything has progressed.
I'll be sure to do some donations once I'm up & running!
