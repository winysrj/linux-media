Makes sense.

By using the index concept, I don't think we need another ioctl. Also,
there's no way for kernel to handle it, as it will be using the same
magic number of EVIOCGKEYCODEBIG.

I don't think that an ioctl over one /dev/input/event should be the proper way
to ask kernel to create another filtered /dev/input/event. As it were commented
that the multimedia keys on some keyboards could benefit on having a filter
capability, maybe we may have a sysfs node at class input that would allow
the creation/removal of the filtered event interface.

I don't see the need for a table index. If we have 3 input event interfaces
for a given IR, each will have its own private keycode table.

There are several different things mixed above. It may be a good idea
to allow extending the ioctls from the input event device to other input
classes. Yet, I'm currently not seeing any usage for it.

In the specific case of EVIOCGKEYCODEBIG/EVIOCSKEYCODEBIG, those are needed
for all input devices whose scancode is bigger than 32 bits. It is not
specific to IR.

I don't think we need to add ioctl's to change RX/TX parameters. The better
is to do it via sysfs. I've added yesterday one of such parameter for the
nec IR decoder, allowing enabling/disabling the decoder, per irrcv:

http://git.linuxtv.org/mchehab/ir.git?a=commit;h=b763c070b038cfd7cc5f7f7109039f5d9f995c46

When porting the RC-5 decoder from saa7134, two additional parameters will be
needed, in order to preserve the current features.

The IR tx is a different thing. It should be implemented as a separate device.
