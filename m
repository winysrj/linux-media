Interesting. But I wonder if this can be implemented as controls? That seems
to me to be a better fit.

Definitely not, although using debugfs might be a good idea.

Can you split off the implementation of these ioctls from the rest of the
driver? And I think you should look into debugfs to see if that isn't a better
fit then custom ioctls. debugfs has the advantage that you can make changes
later as it isn't considered to be a public API. And this is used primarily
for debugging/testing after all.

But I think it is best to split this off and concentrate on getting the driver
itself in first. In general we don't like custom ioctls unless there is a
really good reason for it. They tend to be poorly maintained and documented
and can become a bit of a nuisance over time.
