Sorry, I've tried your suggestion, but the two directories are still empty.

I verified the test environment as follows:

You will notice that the kernel I have used is 3.7.4. I hope that's a 
suitable kernel for your tests. I've moved away from the 3.8 development 
kernel onto one that's stable and on which Martin has identified a 
solution. I see Greg KH released 3.7.5 yesterday and it includes a 
pciehp change. I'll upgrade to that, run the tests again and report back.

One question - should I include the (acpi) pci_slot driver in the kernel 
build or does pciehp populate the directories without pci_slot?

Thanks again.
