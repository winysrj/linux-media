Forgot to mention, but it could make sense to have a version
that would allow more than 360 values for the angle.
We can do that via linear interpolation. 

Something like (untested):

#define INT_2PI			((s32)(2 * 3.141592653589 * 32768.0))

static inline s32 fixp_sin32_rad(u32 radians)
{
	int degree;
	s32 v1, v2, dx, dy;
	u64 tmp;

	degree = (radians * 360) / INT_2PI;

	v1 = fixp_sin32(degree);
	v2 = fixp_sin32(degree + 1);

	dx = INT_2PI / 360;
	dy = v2 - v1;

	tmp = radians - (degree * INT_2PI) / 360;
	tmp *= dy;
	do_div(tmp, dx);

	ret (s32)(v1 + tmp64);
}
