See the em28xx driver. It uses tvp5150 at the device node, and works properly.

It should be noticed, however, that the implementation at tvp5150 doesn't
implement standards detection properly, due to hardware limitation.

A proper implementation of standards detection is to get the standards mask from
userspace and let the driver detect between the standards that the userspace is
expecting.

So, userspace could, for example, do things like:

	v4l2_std_id std = V4L2_STD_PAL_M | V4L2_STD_NTSC_M | V4L2_STD_PAL_DK;

	ioctl (fd, VIDIOC_S_STD, &std);
	msleep (100);
	ioctl (fd, VIDIOC_G_STD, &std);
	if (std & V4L2_STD_625_50)
		height = 576;
	else
		height = 480;

The above code won't work with the current tvp5150 driver, due to two reasons:

1) The tvp5150 register 0x28 doesn't allow an arbitrary standards mask like the above.
The driver does support standards detection, if V4L2_STD_ALL is passed into it.

2) even if V4L2_STD_ALL is used, the driver currently doesn't implement a
vidioc_g_std callback. So, the driver cannot return back to userspace and to
the bridge driver what standard were detected. Without this information, userspace
might use the wrong number of lines when allocating the buffer, and this won't
work.

Of course, patches for fixing this are welcome.

Thanks,
Mauro
