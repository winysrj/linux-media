I just got a Terratec Cinergy C PCI HD CI, and as often happens, I notice
problems right after the buy. In this case, it seems that CAM support is
not available.

While preparing to return the card, I wanted to check whether the support
is expected soon. However, I have not been able to learn what the issues
are from reading the archives. Can someone enlighten me?

As a matter of principle, I would prefer getting this to work, so if I can
help out with testing or even programming, do let me know.


Thanks.
