Hello there,
I am interested in ability to get stereo channels working with my avertv 
studio 303 which is a cx88 based.
I am not a developer nor I understand this stuff very well but anyway 
I'd like to try this out if it may help. With current v4l builds I am 
getting mono sound each time tv app is started (I am using mplayer btw).

So here are a few questions hopefully it's not a problem to ask them here:
1) are these patches already included in some repository? If not how 
should I go about applying them? Is the diff command the right way? What 
branch are they against?

2) The comments below indicates audio functionality for cx88 is not 
working as it should. So shal I be able to get stereo sound after 
applying these patches?

3) are there any tunner settings required in order to get stereo sound? 
or perhaps settings for some other modules?


Thanks


Peter
