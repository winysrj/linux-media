It is probably easier for me to do this step, as I have my hg import
scripts. However, as I don't have the PCTV devices added at dib0700,
I can't test.

OK, I did this work, as it just took me a few minutes to rebase patches
1 and 2. I didn't apply the patches that started with "djh" since they
seemed to be a few hacks during the development time.

The tree is at:

git://linuxtv.org/mchehab/experimental.git branch xc4000

There are two warnings there that needs to be fixed:

drivers/media/common/tuners/xc4000.c:1293: warning: ‘xc4000_is_firmware_loaded’ defined but not used
drivers/media/common/tuners/xc4000.c: In function ‘check_firmware.clone.0’:
drivers/media/common/tuners/xc4000.c:1107: warning: ‘version’ may be used uninitialized in this function

Both seems to be trivial.

A disclaimer notice here: I didn't make any cleanup at the code,
(except by running a whitespace cleanup script) nor I've reviewed it. 

IMO, the next step is to test the rebases against a real hardware, 
and adding a few patches fixing it, if the rebases broke.

The next step would be fix the CodingStyle, and run checkpatch.pl.
There aren't many CodingStyle warnings/errors (13 errors, 28 warnings).
Most of the errors are due to the excess usage of printk's for debug,
and due to some obsolete code commented with //.
