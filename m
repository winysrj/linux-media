It's indeed an interesting idea to declare the flash controller in the
sensor's properties rather than those of the ISP. The obvious upside is that
this way it's easy to figure out which subdev group the flash controller
belongs to.

There are a few other things to consider as well:

- You can't have a flash without a sensor. I can't think of why this would
  be a real issue, though.

- Relations other than one-to-one become difficult. One flash but two
  cameras --- think of stereo cameras.

	- One camera and two flashes. I haven't seen any but I don't think
	  that's unthinkable.

- It's not very nice of the ISP driver to just go and parse the
  sensor's properties.

- As the property is FIMC specific, the sensor DT node now carries FIMC
  related information.

A generic solution would be preferrable as this is not a FIMC related
problem.

I have to admit that I can't think of a better solution right now than just
putting a list of the flash device phandles to the ISP device's DT node, and
then adding information on which sensor (numeric ID) the flash is related to
as an array. Better ideas would be welcome.
