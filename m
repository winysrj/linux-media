Sunday and Tuesday. The discussions will happen on Sunday. On Tuesday, we'll
have the opportunity to exchange some information with the other people from
KS and from the other workshops.

As Monday will be free for most people, it probably makes sense to organize
some informal meetings there for the ones that won't be at the KS only day.

No, but it requires an invitation, and I need to pass the names of the
participants to KS organizers.

So, please let me know if you intend to be there, for me to send you
an invitation.

Thanks,
Mauro
