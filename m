I'm still not sure about returning an error in this case.

And what should TRY_FMT do?

Do you know what current codecs do? Return EINVAL or replace with a supported format?

It would be nice to standardize on one rule or another.

The spec says that it should always return a valid format, but not all drivers adhere
to that. Perhaps we need to add a flag to let the driver signal the behavior of S_FMT
to userspace.

This is a long-standing issue with S_FMT, actually.

What exactly do you mean with 'stream metadata'? Definitely something for
the glossary.

I'd drop the whole 'in any order' in the text above. This has always been
the case, and I think it is only confusing. I think what you really want
to say is that both queues operate independently and quite possibly at
different rates. So clients should operate them independently as well.

Is this what drivers do today? I thought it was applied immediately?
This sounds like something for which you need the Request API.

Note: TRY_ENCODER_CMD should also be supported, likely via a standard helper

STREAMON on which queue? Shouldn't there be a STREAMOFF first?

This feels wrong. Calling STREAMON on a queue that is already streaming does nothing
according to the spec. I think you should either call CMD_START or STREAMOFF/ON on
the OUTPUT queue. Of course, calling STREAMOFF first will dequeue any queued OUTPUT
buffers that were queued since ENC_CMD_STOP was called. But that's normal behavior
for STREAMOFF.
