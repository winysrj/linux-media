	Hello,

Le mercredi 11 avril 2012 20:02:00 Mauro Carvalho Chehab, vous avez écrit :

Fair enough. But then we can do that instead:
typedef XXX __enum_t;
where XXX is the unsigned integer with the right number of bits. Since Linux 
does not use short enums, this ought to work fine.

That is unfortunately not true. You do follow that rule for new fields to 
existing V4L2 structure. But you have been royally ignoring that rule when it 
comes to extending existing enumerations:

linux-media does regularly add new enum values to existing enums. That is new 
stuff too, and every single time you do that, you do BREAK THE USERSPACE ABI. 
This is entirely unacceptable and against established kernel development 
policies.

For instance, in Linux 3.1, V4L2_CTRL_TYPE_BITMASK was added. This broke 
userspace. And there are some pending patches adding more of the same thing... 
And V4L2_MEMORY_DMABUF will similarly break the user-to-kernel interface, 
which is yet worse.

I cannot see how the kernel is protected against userspace injecting error 
values into enums. For all I know, depending how the kernel is compiled, 
userspace might be able to trigger "undefined" behavior in kernel space.

Is it be several years too late to fix a bug?

OK. But then you cannot update extend existing enums... No DMA buffers, no 
integer menu controls...
