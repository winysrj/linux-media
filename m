Can you describe how the memory areas differ specifically?
Is there one that is always faster but very small, or are there
just specific circumstances under which some memory is faster than
another?

We already established that we have to know something about the banks,
and your additional input makes it even clearer that we need to consider
the bigger picture here: We need to describe parts of memory separately
regarding general performance, device specific allocations and hotplug
characteristics.

It still sounds to me that this can be done using the NUMA properties
that Linux already understands, and teaching more subsystems about it,
but maybe the memory hotplug developers have already come up with
another scheme. The way that memory hotplug and CMA choose their
memory regions certainly needs to take both into account. As far as
I can see there are both conflicting and synergistic effects when
you combine the two.
