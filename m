Andy,

This is a great answer!  Thanks very much.  When I get into this situation again
I will know what to look for.

A possible reason why I got into this problem in the first place is that I tried
many combinations of parameters with mplayer and azap in order to learn how
to use the USB tuner in both the ATSC and the NTSC mode.  I will look back
in the terminal history to see if I can find anything.

Regards,
Richard
