Hi Andrew,

Thank you for your comments and interest in this!

This is encouraging, thanks. Merging a contiguous allocator seems like a 
lost cause, with a relative disinterest of non-embedded people, and on 
the other hand because of the difficulty to satisfy those actually 
interested. With virtually everybody having their own, custom solutions, 
agreeing on one is nearly impossible.

I think Zach's work is more focused on IOMMU and on unifying virtual 
memory handling. As far as I understand, any physical allocator can be 
plugged into it, including CMA. CMA solves a different set of problems.

As a media developer myself, I talked with people and many have 
expressed their interest. Among them were developers from ST-Ericsson, 
Intel and TI, to name a few. Their SoCs, like ours at Samsung, require 
contiguous memory allocation schemes as well.


I am working on a driver framework for media for memory management (on 
the logical, not physical level). One of the goals is to allow plugging 
in custom allocators and memory handling functions (cache management, 
etc.). CMA is intended to be used as one of the pluggable allocators for 
it. Right now, many media drivers have to provide their own, more or 
less complicated, memory handling, which is of course undesirable. Some 
of those make it to the kernel, many are maintained outside the mainline.

The problem is that, as far as I am aware, there have already been quite 
a few proposals for such allocators and none made it to the mainline. So 
companies develop their own solutions and maintain them outside the 
mainline.

I think that the interest is definitely there, but people have their 
deadlines and assume that it is close to impossible to have a contiguous 
allocator merged.

Your help and support would be very much appreciated. Working in 
embedded Linux for some time now, I feel that the need is definitely 
there and is quite substantial.
