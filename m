I think we'll at least need a draft of those to make sense of these
patches.  Otherwise they just look very clumsy.

I'm sorry but this API is just a trainwreck.  Right now we have the
nice little kmap_atomic API, which never fails and has a very nice
calling convention where we just pass back the return address, but does
not support sleeping inside the critical section.

And kmap, wh—ñch may fail and requires the original page to be passed
back.  Anything that mixes these two concepts up is simply a non-starter.
