To my knowledge there is nothing planned with respect to V4L/DVB.

Monday is the closed session of the kernel summit. All workshops of the
various subsystems are scheduled on Tuesday.

That doesn't mean nothing happens: I'll be attending the gstreamer
conference on Monday myself.

I'll make sure you'll be invited. I'm not even sure you need an official
invite for the workshop. I know that anyone who also attends the LPC can
get an invite for the workshops on Tuesday for free.

Anyway, I'll put your name on the list and make sure that Mauro will pass
that on to the organizers once he's back from vacation.

Regards,

	Hans
