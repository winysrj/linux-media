As you've no doubt seen the amount of patches that need to be reviewed is huge.
Given the fact that it is 1) busy at work as well and 2) I will be absent from
September 23-October 10, I will have to prioritize. So I think it is better if
I postpone the review. Once the MC API has settled and vimc has been rebased on
top of that, then I will hopefully have time to look at it.

The reality is that it can't be merged anyway while the MC API is being reworked,
so I think it's better if I revisit this once it is rebased.

Sorry about that....

Regards,

	Hans
