I stand by my answer to your patches quoted above from a technical point
of view; we should not be mapping SDRAM using device mappings.

That ioremap() inside dma_declare_coherent_memory() needs to die, but
it seems that those who now look after the DMA API really aren't
interested in the technical details of this being wrong for some
architecture - just like they're not really interested in the details
of devices using dma-engines for their DMA support.

I'm afraid that the DMA support in Linux sucks because of this, and I
have no real desire to participate in discussions with brick walls over
this.

Certainly the memblock_alloc()+free()+remove() is the right way to
reserve the memory, but as it stands dma_declare_coherent_memory()
should not be used on ARMv6 or higher CPUs to pass that memory to the
device driver.
