That's actually the only patch that broke compilation. This patch was
actually generated as an intermediate step to patch 4, using git citool,
in order to make easier to review the code changes, splitting the code
move from the actual device split.

Anyway, it shouldn't break compilation.

The OOPS was fixed on a separate patch (patch 5). I opted to keep it in
separate, as it seemed interesting to preserve in git history why that
change happened. Eventually, I can reorder the patch to avoid the OOPS
to actually happen on bisect.

Done. See Patch series v4.

Ok. Then the better seems to apply them upstream, in order to allow
them to have a broader testing.

I'm acquiring two new em28xx devices. Let's hope that at least one of them
is DVB-only.
