Yes. We just need contiguous memory. Coherency is important as far as when dma
transfer finishes user land is able to see the new data. Could be done by something like
dma_{,un}map_single()

Sure, but in any case videobuf-dma-contig framework in drivers/media/video
is already built around dma-coherent (nevertheless it is precious), so the two new
functions are just a helpful extension to the existing use of dma-coherent memory.

In any case, as far as these two functions will be mainly used by media/video folks
they could be added not to the drivers/base/dma-coherent.c (where I see their place),
but to drivers/media/video/videobuf-dma-contig.c. In that case the disadvantage will be
that if someone out of the media tree will need this functionality he(she) will need to
compile media/videobuf-dma-contig.c

Yes.

That will help. I will be happy if someone can do it. I am inpaciently waiting for 
alloc_huhepages()/free_hugepages() API - (transparent hugepages patches, may be)
That also could be a solution for media/video folks with hardware that cannot do 
scatter/gatter. Another solution will be an IOMMU that could present a scattered
user land buffer as contiguous dma address range (I have played in the past with 
AGP-GART without great success).

Thanks.
