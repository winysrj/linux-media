This is however out-of-scope for your project. For radio devices you can
just take the tuner token on open.

BTW, the tuner token in v4l2 should *only* be taken if there actually is
a tuner. Luckily that's very easy to test for: struct v4l2_ioctl_ops will
have a non-NULL vidioc_s_tuner field.

I want to think about this myself (i.e. non-tuner inputs) and do some
testing as well. I'll get back to this when I know more myself.

Certainly.

>From what I know I don't think these types of devices will pose any problem
for this approach. However, in general you should consider all sorts of
combinations and see if the design will still work for those. You don't
want to have to redesign it later just because you ignored a particular type
of device. Which I why I want to see the snd-usb-audio work first, since I
think that's probably the most complex part of the whole design.

And I do think you should try to get one of those cards (cx88 or cx23885
based). They are common, they are complex and have hybrid tuners, sometimes
with radio support as well. You can probably get some of them fairly cheaply
on ebay. These are good cards to test with, if not now then in the near
future. My philosophy is that you can never have too much hardware :-)
