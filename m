This is the case here. Before the RC subsystem, the decoding for NEC and RC-5
were done inside ir-core (at ir-functions). Also, all the keymap entries (RC_MAP)
were compiled in-kernel.

The intention is to move the RC_MAP keytables to userspace, by default, but there
are still some work to be done at the userspace application before we can do it.

So, without RC_MAP, IR_NEC_DECODER and IR_RC5_DECODER, the input driver will be 
compiled, but the IR support may not actually work, if the board needs IR raw
support.

That's said, the support for RC-6, JVC and Sony protocols (IR_RC6_DECODER, 
IR_JVC_DECODER and IR_SONY_DECODER) are new. Yet, even on this case, it may make
sense to keep the default to Y, or to add a logic to auto-select the IR decoder 
protocols that are needed in order to support the bundled IR found at the compiled
drivers.
