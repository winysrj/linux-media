Hello,

I'm sorry for a late reply, but after Kernel Summit/ELC I have some comments.

The real question is whether it is possible to create any generic support
infrastructure. I really doubt. IMHO this is something that will be hacked for
each 'product release' and will never read the mainline...

I'm really not convinced if it is possible to go for the completely dynamic
buffer management, especially if we are implementing a proof-of-concept 
solution. Please notice the following facts:

1. all v4l2 drivers do the 'static' buffer management - memory is being 
allocated on REQBUF() call and then mapped permanently into both userspace 
and dma (io) address space.

2. dma-mapping api is very limited in the area of the dynamic buffer management,
this API has been designed definitely for static buffer allocation and mapping.

It looks that fully dynamic buffer management requires a complete change of 
v4l2 api principles (V4L3?) and a completely new DMA API interface. That's 
probably the reason by none of the GPU driver relies on the DMA-mapping API
and implements custom solution for managing the mappings. 

This reminds me one more issue I've noticed in the current dma buf proof-of-
concept. You assumed that the exporter will be responsible for mapping the 
buffer into io address space of all the client devices. What if the device 
needs additional custom hooks/hacks during the mappings? This will be a serious
problem for the current GPU drivers for example. IMHO the API will be much
clearer if each client driver will map the scatter list gathered from the
dma buf by itself. Only the client driver has the complete knowledge how 
to do this correctly for this particular device. This way it will also work
with devices that don't do the real DMA (like for example USB devices that
copy all data from usb packets to the target buffer with the cpu).
