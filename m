It won't. Unless the host driver itself calls into the DMA API, too
(are there any that don't?).

Indeed.

However, having the link errors helps when annotating the Kconfig files
with HAS_DMA dependencies.

Unfortunately the check for "hcd->self.uses_dma" (which boils down to
"dev->dma_mask != NULL") isn't sufficient to cause breakage at compilation
time when a Kconfig entry incorrectly doesn't depend on HAS_DMA.
