That may be tricky.  cma_alloc() takes four parameters each of which is
required for CMA.  No other existing set of API uses all those arguments.
This means, CMA needs it's own, somehow unique API.  I don't quite see
how the APIs may be unified or "made similar".  Of course, I'm gladly
accepting suggestions.

Because it's quite a bit of work and instead of diverting my attention I'd
prefer to make CMA as good as possible and then integrate it with other
subsystems.  Also, adding the integration would change the patch from being
4k lines to being like 40k lines.

What I'm trying to say is that I don't consider that a work for now but
rather a further enchantments.

Yes, I agree.
