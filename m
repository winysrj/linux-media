No, topology_version is just a mononotonic counter that starts on 0
and it is incremented every time a graph object is added or removed. 

It is meant to be used to track if the topology changes after a previous
call to this ioctl.

On existing media controller embedded device hardware, it should
always be zero, but on devices that allow dynamic hardware changes
(some embedded DTV hardware allows that - also on devices with FPGA,
with RISC CPUs or hot-pluggable devices) should use it to know if the
hardware got modified. 

This is also needed on multi-function devices where different drivers 
are used for each function. That's the case of au0828, with uses a
media driver for video, and the standard USB Audio Class driver for
audio. As the drivers are independent, the topology_version will
be zero when the first driver is loaded, but it will change during
at probe time on second driver. It will also be increased if one
of the drivers got unbind.
