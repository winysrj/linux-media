Both apparently exist, but the firmware is the same.

The main difference registers in the firmwares
dvb-usb-it9137-01.fw -->clk enable 0xd81a --> tuner_it91x_priv.h...set_it9137_template
dvb-usb-it9135-01.fw -->clk enable 0xcfff --> tuner_it91x_priv.h...set_it9135_template
dvb-usb-it9135-02.fw -->clk enable 0xcfff --> tuner_it91x_priv.h...set_it9135_template

As far as It can tell all the latest firmwares are based on
set_it9135_template.

On the KWorld the second device is another it9137 and has an eeprom
24c02 fitted.

So dropping the dvb-usb-it9137-01.fw firmware is fine.
