Thank you for the quick response. Hmm, I am not seeing anything about
the saa7113 or similar chip. I just replugged it, and here is what
showed up in the log:

So, I popped the case on the dongle and I did see  a chip (right next
to the video cables) labelled CJC7113. I would assume(/hope) this is a
SAA7113 compatible chip. I actually don't care about audio in my
particular application, but there is a Realtek ALC6555 on the bottom
as well.
