I have the exact same symptoms with a technisat cablestar HD2,
 also a twinhan clone like the terratec. 
Glad to know this isn't a broken hardware issue (that
is it seems highly unlikely we have the exact same problem 
for it to be a hardware malfunction ). 

Have used the .31 and .32 and .33 kernel in ubuntu under karmic and lucid.
With a own compiled mantis driver from intuxication and linuxtv mercurial repos.

So it kinda looks like this is a ubuntu thing? Or are there alternative 
conclusions?

 Hans
