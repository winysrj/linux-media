I see no reason to block the highly desirable async (sub)notifier code
while waiting for us to hammer out the details of something that is for the
most part unrelated to this. That usually takes a lot of time and since
the async (sub)notifier code is an internal API that can be changed later
you really don't want it to be stuck in limbo for all that time.

There are already a few drivers pending on this and, as you said yourself,
it is very unpleasant for driver authors to have their work stuck in the
queue for a long time.

Ditto for postponing work on this until the life-time issues have been
solved. If Niklas can do this work while you and Sakari work on the life-time
issues, then I see nothing wrong with that.

For APIs internal to the kernel you can make gradual improvements. As long
as each change makes things a bit better I happily accept it. Waiting until
everything is perfect and beautiful means nothing ever gets accepted since
it'll never be perfect as there is always something that can be done better...

It's what makes uAPI additions so hard, because you have to try and make it
as close to perfect as you can, and we never quite succeed there either.
