Yep. Fbdev has a separation of type (how pixel values are laid out in memory),
fb_bitfield structs (how tuples are formed into pixels), and visual (how to
interprete the tuples).

The fb_bitfield structs do have RGB-centric names, but you could use them
for e.g. Y, Cb, Cr, and alpha, giving a proper visual. Unfortunately the
YCbCr visuals haven't made it into mainline.

FOURCC unifies all of that in (not so) unique 32-bit IDs.
