Having it properly documented is always a good idea, especially since a similar
fix might be needed on other drivers that also need contiguous memory. While it
currently is used only on devices embedded on hardware with no iommu, there are
some x86 hardware that doesn't allow DMA scatter/gather.

Btw, it may be worth to take a look at vb2 dma contig module, as it might have
similar issues.
