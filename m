No, that's not what I meant.

Whether or not ioctls are implemented can in many cases be deduced from the
QUERYCAP capabilities: e.g. if V4L2_CAP_STREAMING is set, then the buffer I/O
ioctls have to be there. For other ioctls the test whether they are implemented
is also often straightforward: e.g. if VIDIOC_G_INPUT returns -EINVAL, then
that can only mean that it isn't implemented, and neither are ENUM_INPUT and
S_INPUT.

In cases where only the G variant is implemented, there we need to tighten
the spec and require that these ioctls are properly implemented: you either
implement all of the ENUM/G/TRY/S ioctls or none.

Currently ENUM_FRAMESIZES/INTERVALS is one set of ioctls where this is very
ambiguous. For most of the others it is pretty straightforward.

I suspect that in most cases the drivers are fairly reasonable, but the spec
wasn't updated with the new error codes.

No, what we do is perfectly consistent: i.e. we always return EINVAL when an
ioctl is not supported. That's what 'consistent' means. Whether that is the
*right* error code is something else.

But right now our API and our documentation is perfectly consistent and has been
for years.

It's a 'fix' that I fear may break applications because drivers suddenly change
their behavior. You can't just ignore that. You also can't analyze applications,
since closed source apps may also use it, and we obviously have no control over
those.

Actually, all it needs for the most part is that current implicit rules are made
explicit: if a certain querycap flag is set, then a corresponding set of ioctls
must be implemented. If I can call the GET ioctl, then the ENUM and SET (and
TRY) must also be implemented. Sensible rules at any time, they just need to be
made explicit.

If you want to change it to ENOTTY, then go right ahead. But you can explain
it to our customers when their app suddenly breaks for some hardware.

I don't get it. This is really not a problem. We rarely, if ever, get complaints
about it, and there is a ton of other much more important stuff that needs to
be done.
