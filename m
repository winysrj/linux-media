Hello Marek,

     We are currently testing CMA (v16) on Snowball platform.
     This feature is very promising, thanks for pushing it!

     During our stress tests, we encountered some problems :

     1) Contiguous allocation lockup:
         When system RAM is full of Anon pages, if we try to allocate a 
contiguous buffer greater than the min_free value, we face a 
dma_alloc_from_contiguous lockup.
         The expected result would be dma_alloc_from_contiguous() to fail.
         The problem is reproduced systematically on our side.

     2) Contiguous allocation fail:
         We have developed a small driver and a shell script to 
allocate/release contiguous buffers.
         Sometimes, dma_alloc_from_contiguous() fails to allocate the 
contiguous buffer (about once every 30 runs).
         We have 270MB Memory passed to the kernel in our configuration, 
and the CMA pool is 90MB large.
         In this setup, the overall memory is either free or full of 
reclaimable pages.


     For now, we didn't had time to investigate further theses problems.
     Have you already faced this kind of issues?
     Could someone testing CMA on other boards confirm/infirm theses 
problems?

Best regards,
Maxime
