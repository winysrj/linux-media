Setting the JPEG quality in sonixj has been removed when automatic
quality adjustment has been added (git commit b96cfc33e7). At this
time, I let the JPEG get function, but it could have been removed as
well: I don't think the users are interested by this quality, and the
applications may find it looking at the quantization tables of the
images.

Otherwise, letting the users/applications to set this quality is
dangerous: if the quality is too high, the images cannot be fully
transmitted because their size is too big for the USB 1.1 channel.

So, IMO, you should let the sonixj as it is, and I will remove the
get_jepgcomp.
