Hi,
How can I help (I'm not pro, It's only a hobby for me..:P) to get AverTV
Volar Video Capture (H830D) to work on linux?
Or can someone help me make it work? Is it necessary to make a module
for it from scratch? I can't find the firmware anywhere, is it
necessary? I can't find any .bin file to begin with...Is it even
possible for linux to support it?

Thanks in advance and keep the fantastic work you've done

Unkuiri
