Hi Tejun,

Thanks for responding to my previous questions.  I have one more.

The objective is "allowing work items to be freed while being executed",
to me, it does not seem safe to me to allow flush_kthread_work() to
actually dereference the passed in work pointer.

flush_kthread_work() could theoretically be executed after the work
function was executed by the worker kthread which frees the 'work'
object, and that the memory 'work' points to could theoretically already
be reallocated for something else.  (I admit the above likely has very
low probability of occuring.)  

Is there a way to avoid dereferencing 'work' here?

Andy
