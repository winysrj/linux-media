OK.  Keep it in the back of your mind though.

Please try and test the output of a VCR or DVD play plugged into the
HVR-1600.  (We don't need sound, just the video.)

This will tell us if the problem happens before the CX23418 chip's
analog front end (i.e. in the RF and analog tuner) or not.


$ v4l2-ctl -d /dev/video0 -n

OK.  You have a board with the same tuner as I have.

All I have for an analog RF source is a DTV STB, so a very clean channel
3 is all I have to try and duplicate the problem.

This is the freq for both US Broadcast and US Cable channel 7 BTW.

OK.  That eliminates that potential source of problems.

OK.  The problem I mentioned is usually for when you have a very good
picture otherwise.  If the entire image is poor, then this likely isn't
the cause.

So try this:

1. Configure your system so they MythTV backend, or any other
application that messes with the video card, won't start up on reboot.

2. Shutdown the machine & power-off & power back on.

3. Do these for steps for US Cable

$ v4l2-ctl -d /dev/video0 -i 0
Video input set to 0 (Tuner 1)

$ ivtv-tune -d /dev/video0 -t us-cable -c 7
/dev/video0: 175.250 MHz

$ cat /dev/video0 > foo.mpg


Note that v4l2-ctl and ivtv-tune default to "/dev/video0", but I see you
have a "/dev/hvr1600"(?).  In all my examples, I explicitly call out the
device node as "/dev/video0".  Please replace "/dev/video0" with the
appropriate device node name on your system.

Received it.  It looks really, really bad: like an untuned channel.
Please try again with the steps I provided explicitly calling out the
device node.

Thanks,
