I missing the need for ww_mutex_lock_slow(). AFAICT we should be able to tell
its the first lock in the ctx and thus we cannot possibly deadlock.

I suppose we'll figure something out when this becomes a bottleneck. Ideally
we'd do something like:

 ctx->stamp = local_clock();

but for now we cannot guarantee that's not jiffies, and I suppose that's a tad
too coarse to work for this.

Also, why is 0 special?

trylocks can never deadlock they don't block per definition, I don't see the
point of the _single() thing here.

as per the above, I'm missing the rationale for having this.

Why compare stamps? I expected: ctx == hold_ctx here.

Why not simply write: ctx->stamp > hold_ctx->stamp ?

If we need to deal with equal stamps from different contexts we could tie-break
based on ctx address or so, but seeing its a global counter from the class,
that shouldn't happen for now.

A few more cases where NULL != 0 :-)
