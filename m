We need to investigate the internals of dma-mapping API first. Right now I know too
little in this area.

Well, afair there are also systems with one central iommu module, which is shared 
between devices. I have no idea how such model will fit into the dma-mapping API.

Mapping the same memory area multiple times with different cache settings is not
legal on ARMv7+ systems. Currently the problems might caused by the low-memory
kernel linear mapping and second mapping created for example by dma_alloc_coherent()
function.
