Once and for all: We have *not* discussed a generic video streaming
application. It's only, I repeat, only about accessing a remote DVB API
tuner *as if it was local*. No data received from a satellite, cable or
terrestrial DVB network shall be modified by this application!

Virtually *every* user of it will use it in a LAN.

It can't be so hard to understand.
