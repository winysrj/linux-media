Woops, totally missed the addition of these. Can somebody explain to used
to rather coherent x86 what we need these for and the code-flow would look
like in a typical example. I was kinda assuming that devices would bracket
their use of a buffer with the attachment_map/unmap calls and any cache
coherency magic that might be needed would be somewhat transparent to
users of the interface?

The map call gets the dma_data_direction parameter, so it should be able
to do the right thing. And because we keep the attachement around, any
caching of mappings should be possible, too.

Yours, Daniel

PS: Slightly related, because it will make the coherency nightmare worse,
afaict: Can we kill mmap support?
