Right, my bad, I had misread your patch. Please see below for a couple of 
small comments.

No need for the second const keyword here.

I would have used "uvc_video_" as a prefix, to be in sync with the surrounding 
functions. What would you think of uvc_video_validate_buffer() ?

And no need for const at all here.

The indentation is wrong here, the ! on the second line should be aligned to 
the first 'buf' of the first line.

If you agree with these changes I can perform them while applying, there's no 
need to resubmit the patch.
