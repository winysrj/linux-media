Hi Jean-Michel,

Thank you for the patch.

As this is core code I believe the DT bindings should be documented somewhere 
in Documentation/devicetree/bindings/i2c/.

It does more than that, it also creates the device.

Could you elaborate on that ? I would explain that the address is retrieved 
from the firmware based on the name, and that default_addr is used in case the 
firmware doesn't provide any information.

This call could fail in which case addr will be uninitialized.

addr isn't a pointer. I'm surprised the compiler hasn't warned you.

The whole logic can be simplified to

	struct device_node *np = client->dev.of_node;
	u32 addr = default_addr;
	int i;

	if (np) {
		i = of_property_match_string(np, "reg-names", name);
		if (i >= 0)
			of_property_read_u32_index(np, "reg", i, &addr);
	}

The function is already documented in i2c-core.c, I would ditch this comment.
