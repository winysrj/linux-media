Well, you're basically telling that you need an IR encoder to convert
from protocol/scancode into pulse/space lengths. 

As we need/want a portable interface that will provide the same API
to  userspace, no matter what hardware, I can see two alternatives:

1) Use a lirc-like API for that, using the IR encoder code in userspace;

2) The same way as we mapped IR decoders, add IR encoders that can be
used either for IR TX or to provide IR wakeup codes.

IMO, (2) is a much more elegant option.

Mauro
