As the "at least one user" I can confirm that the patch has indeed
corrected the problem on my 2.6.38-gentoo-r6, 2.6.39.3 vanilla, and
3.0.0-rc7 kernels.

This is what loading the module with the "debug=1" option outputs:

input: iMON Panel, Knob and Mouse(15c2:ffdc) as
/devices/pci0000:00/0000:00:10.2/usb4/4-2/4-2:1.0/input/input7
imon 4-2:1.0: Unknown 0xffdc device, defaulting to VFD and iMON IR (id 0x00)
Registered IR keymap rc-imon-pad
input: iMON Remote (15c2:ffdc) as
/devices/pci0000:00/0000:00:10.2/usb4/4-2/4-2:1.0/rc/rc2/input8
rc2: iMON Remote (15c2:ffdc) as
/devices/pci0000:00/0000:00:10.2/usb4/4-2/4-2:1.0/rc/rc2
imon 4-2:1.0: iMON device (15c2:ffdc, intf0) on usb<4:3> initialized
usbcore: registered new interface driver imon
intf0 decoded packet: 00 00 00 00 00 00 24 01
intf0 decoded packet: 00 00 00 00 00 00 24 01
intf0 decoded packet: 00 00 00 00 00 00 24 01
intf0 decoded packet: 00 00 00 00 00 00 24 01
...

The decoded packet lines are fast and furious with no deliberate IR
input (the VFD is in use), which might explain how this device managed
to break the code in the small window available.

Thank you Jarod and Andy for taking the time to track this problem down
to give it a drubbing.

Regards,
Chris
