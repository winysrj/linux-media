Subject: Lifeview FlyDVB Hybrid PCI (LR-306N): doesn't work anymore

Hi,
I own a Lifeview FlyDVB Hybrid LR-306N model; it is a PCI model, and
I've been happily using it with my Mythtv for a couple of years, despite
it was identified as a Cardbus model. About two months ago, I have
upgraded kernel, and since then DVB function doesn't work anymore.

I've checked what's changed, and I've noticed /var/log/messages once was
something like:

If I understand correctly, the main difference is that now tda1004x
module seems to be unable to recognize already present firmware rev 29
(failing to start/un-reset device?). So it tries to load a new firmware,
rev 20; maybe because of this, maybe because of an incorrect
resetting procedure, anyway it doesn't work on my board: if I try to
tune any station with tzap, I sometimes get FE_HAS_LOCK, sometimes I
don't, but as I try to display video with mplayer I always get no
video/audio (actually most of the times mplayer doesn't even show a window).
Actually, this is what happens since mid-february or so, after most
recent changes to saa7134 module. Before that, the board was almost
non-working, but behaviour was far less consistent. Usually tda1004x
module, after trying loading firmware several times, gave up. Sometimes
it started with firmware ver 20, and very rarely it was even usable, but
frequently the board went stuck when changing channel, and stopped
tuning anything anymore.
Another oddity is that now analog TV consistently works with tvtime
after the first channel change; that was not the case before. Just for
record, it still doesn't work with mythtv (no tune while scanning), but
I'm sure this won't surprise anybody  ;-) However, no analog, no DVB-T,
so no media center...

I've tried going back in time, pulling from mercurial old versions
trying to determine which patch had broken things, but I wasn't unable
to compile older (than 8848?) versions with my current kernel, so I had
to give up.
So... what's changed in the driver over the last year that stopped it
working? It was OK with kernel 2.6.24.

Thanks.
