I think we should try to keep the two in sync, until we can remove the 
v4l2_mbus_pixelcode enum (I know, I'm being utopian here).

However, I really want all pixel codes to be properly documented, regardless 
of whether we add them to v4l2_mbus_pixelcode or not.

Now that's a good question. We could start a generic video docbook 
documentation. As I expect more infrastructure to be shared between V4L2 and 
DRM (and, who knows, FBDEV...) over time, I think that would be a good move. 
However docbook doesn't seem to be in the DRM developers' good books, so this 
might be frown upon. We could also use a plain text, kerneldoc-like format for 
the common documentation, but the formats would then disappear from the V4L2 
documentation, which isn't a very good idea. For that reason I would favour 
docbook.

I've CC'ed Hans Verkuil who might want to share his opinion on the matter.
