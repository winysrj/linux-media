Yes. We had some discussions in the past to re-license it to LGPL,
if this is going to be used by some other OSS project that would
require that. Most of the code was written by me, and, in the past
the other developers that worked on that also agreed on re-licensing
as LGPL.

So, basically, if gstreamer is willing to use libdvbv5, we'll
relicense it to LGPL.

Mauro
