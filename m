No, not really. If we known about Ubuntu's employ of such utility before
we'd try to come up with workaround or updated the utility proactively
so user-visible changes would be limited.

Yes, that is on my lest (unless somebody beats me to it). Won't help
with the older kernels though, unfortunately.

Not sure if this is needed.

I do not believe that such characterization is called for. We did fix
the breakage that was ABI breakage. The version issue is different. If
we go by what you say _none_ of the versions anywhere can be changed
ever because there might be a program that does not expect new version.
