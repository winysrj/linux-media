This looks very nice, but there are a few things I don't understand yet
and a bunch of trivial comments I have about things I spotted.

Do you have prototype exporter and consumer drivers that you can post
for clarification?

In the patch 2, you have a section about migration that mentions that
it is possible to export a buffer that can be migrated after it
is already mapped into one user driver. How does that work when
the physical addresses are mapped into a consumer device already?

I would make this 'select ANON_INODES', like the other users of this
feature.

I agree with Konrad, this should definitely be EXPORT_SYMBOL_GPL,
because it's really a low-level function that I would expect
to get used by in-kernel subsystems providing the feature to
users and having back-end drivers, but it's not the kind of thing
we want out-of-tree drivers to mess with.

Why not simply get_unused_fd()?

Or may return a negative error code. It's better to be consistent here:
either always return NULL on error, or change the allocation error to
ERR_PTR(-ENOMEM).

You probably mean "if (ret)" here instead of "if (!ret)", right?

I don't see how this works with multiple consumers: For the streaming
DMA mapping, there must be exactly one owner, either the device or
the CPU. Obviously, this rule needs to be extended when you get to
multiple devices and multiple device drivers, plus possibly user
mappings. Simply assigning the buffer to "the device" from one
driver does not block other drivers from touching the buffer, and
assigning it to "the cpu" does not stop other hardware that the
code calling sync_sg_for_cpu is not aware of.

The only way to solve this that I can think of right now is to
mandate that the mappings are all coherent (i.e. noncachable
on noncoherent architectures like ARM). If you do that, you no
longer need the sync_sg_for_* calls.

Do you have a use case for making the interface compile-time disabled?
I had assumed that any code using it would make no sense if it's not
available so you don't actually need this.
