Tegra K1 needs to share buffers across different drivers even for very
basic use-cases since the GPU and display drivers are separate. So while
I agree that the GPU driver can still use explicit synchronization for
internal work, things aren't that simple in general.

Let me try to reconstruct the use-case that caused the lock on Android:
the compositor uses a hardware overlay to display an image. The system
detects that there's little activity and instructs the compositor to put
everything into one image and scan out only that (for power efficiency).
Now with implicit locking the display driver has a lock on the image, so
the GPU (used for compositing) needs to wait for it before it can
composite everything into one image. But the display driver cannot
release the lock on the image until the final image has been composited
and can be displayed instead.

This may not be technically a deadlock, but it's still a stalemate.
Unless I'm missing something fundamental about DMA fences and ww mutexes
I don't see how you can get out of this situation.

Explicit vs. implicit synchronization may also become more of an issue
as buffers are imported from other sources (such as cameras).

The downside of that is that we may end up with two different ways to
synchronize buffers if it turns out that we can't make Android (or other
use-cases) work with DMA fence. However I don't think that justifies
postponing this patch set indefinitely.
