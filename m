Our video coder needs its firmware aligned to 128K plus it has to be located
before any other buffers allocated for the chip.  Because of those, we have
defined a separate region just for the coder's firmware which is small (256K
IIRC) and aligned to 128K.

At this moment, if type is NULL "common" is assumed.

Yes, that's the idea.

I'm not entirely happy with such scheme.

For one, types may overlap: ie. the whole "banka" may be "dma" as well.
This means that a single region could be of several different types.

Moreover, as I've mentioned the video coder needs to allocate buffers from
different banks.  However, on never platform there's only one bank (actually
two but they are interlaced) so allocations from different banks no longer
make sense.  Instead of changing the driver though I'd prefer to only change
the mapping in the platform.
