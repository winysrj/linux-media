Hi Devin, thanks for writing back.

I played the recording back on a MacBook Pro in VLC. It still displays the same artifacts.

My KWorld card works just fine with the same cable feed in to the same PC.

Could
it be that this HVR 1600 card is somehow incompatible with my
motherboard? I've read in various places that this card works best with
PCI 2.3 compliant motherboards. Not sure mine meets that spec.

Anyway, I captured some test video so you can see the problem firsthand.
