Does the 2.6.31-20-generic Ubuntu kernel come bundled with the mantis
driver, or did you build this yourself?  If so, from where and which
version?

AFAIK, mantis wasn't included in mainline until 2.6.33.  I've just filed
a wishlist bug for Debian's 2.6.32 so I'd really be interested in any
Ubuntu work on this...

FWIW I have exactly the same card with no such problems observed.  I am
using a standard Debian 2.6.32-4-amd64 kernel with mantis driver taken
from vanilla 2.6.34-rc4 (after patching mantis-input.c to compensate for
the recent ir layer changes).  This is also what I submitted to Debian
in the wishlist bug report.
