I was thinking on this over the weekend, and I realized that my
response may have been a bit too short and grumpy.  So I wanted to add
one little thing:

It's really great that Marvell is putting the time into doing this
work, and, my gripes notwithstanding, you're doing it right.  You've
sent your code out, listened to the responses you've gotten, and
done the work to try to address them.  Quite a bit of progress has been
made here, and I don't doubt this code will be ready for merging before
too much longer.  Please continue on this path; we do appreciate the
work you're doing.

Thanks,

jon
