I agree with Lars on this.  It would be useful if the user could
describe in more detail his testing methodology.  Also, is there some
previous kernel in which he knew it was working properly?  Has he
*ever* seen it work in his environment?  Do we know definitively that
this really a regression or has the user never seen the board work?
