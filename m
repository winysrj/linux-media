Subject: OT (slightly): is anyone on this list working on camera capture for
 i.MX51?

Hi,

I know that this is off topic because (alas) the i.MX51 support is not 
in the mainline kernel. However, if anyone is working with the camera 
sensor interfaces on this device I would be very interested to talk to 
them, on list or off, because I am stuck! CSI1 works fine, but CSI2 
refuses to do anything...

Bye for now,
Chris
