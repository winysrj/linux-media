Once the fwnode patchset hits mediatree, then yes it can be
converted along with all the others under media/i2c.

Why would the datasheet suggest or not suggest such things?
Coding details like this don't belong in the datasheet.

It's called everywhere under the same device mutex.

Yeah, this driver is much cleaned up from the original, but there are
still some issues like this. The register access errors are really only
being paid attention to during s_power() when loading the initial
register set, which is enough at least to catch a non-existent chip
or basic i2c bus or other hardware issues. But I should work on
catching all access errors. This is something I did in an earlier rev
but I used a questionable short-cut to make it easier to implement.
I'll just have to catch every case one by one.

Can you please rephrase, I don't follow. "same lock for the controls as
you use for the rest" - there's only one device lock owned by this driver
and I am already using that same lock.

It's incremented by media_pipeline_start(), even if the entity is already
a member of the given pipeline.

I added this check because in imx-media, the ov5640 can be streaming
concurrently to multiple video capture devices, and each capture device 
calls
media_pipeline_start() at stream on, which increments the entity stream 
count.

So if one capture device issues a stream off while others are still 
streaming,
ov5640 should remain at stream on. So the entity stream count is being
used as a streaming usage counter. Is there a better way to do this? Should
I use a private stream use counter instead?

I don't understand. regulator_bulk_disable() is still needed, am I missing
something?
