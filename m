Hi Mauro,

I've started trying to understand the code in the following repository:

    http://www.linuxtv.org/hg/~mchehab/tm6010/

I have a few patches I would like to apply. How should I do this?

    * Should I e-mail patches to you?
    * Should I find somewhere to host my repository and get you to pull
them?

If I need to host my repository do you have any suggestions as to where?

Kevin
