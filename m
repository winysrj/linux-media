Right, but we still need a maintainer. Are you capable/willing to 
volunteer for the job?

If you want, I can strip the driver down a lot more and ad back the 
drivers you need. Just tell me what it is you need.

Isn't that a bit drastic?
I mean: those few drivers have been there for ages, and I can't recall 
anyone complaining about them in a serious way.

As I said: give me the numbers of your tbs cards and I will add support 
for them (if they are supported by Luis Alves repo).
That way you are able to test the stability of the saa716x driver in 
it's present state.
