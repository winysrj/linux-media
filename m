 WILL EXECUTION!

 I wish to intimate you with a request that would be of immense benefit 
 to
 both of us. Being an executor of WILL, it is possible that we may be
 tempted to make fortune out of my client situation, when we cannot help
 it, or left with no better option.

 The issue I am presenting to you is about my client who WILLED a 
 fortune
 to his next-of-kin. It was most unfortunate that he and his next-of-kin
 died on the same day in the sharja plane crash of Tuesday 10 February
 2004. I am now faced with confusion of who to pass the fortune to.
 According to the English law, the fortune is supposed to be bequeathed 
 to
 the government. However, I donâ€™t belong to that school of thought which
 proposes that the fortune of unlucky people be given to the government.
 I seek your assistance to act as the beneficiary of the inheritance, 
 and
 lay claim to the legacy(12.4million pounds sterling),which this my
 unfortunate client bequeathed to his next-of-kin. For now, it is
 only known to me, as my client has great confidence in me. Everything 
 will
 be left between you and I. The share would be 40% for you and 60% for
 me. All I have to do is to amend the WILL stating you as the 
 beneficiary
 to the 12.4million pounds sterling.

 I prefer not to divulge my full identity so as not to risk being 
 disbarred.
 The English Bar considers it a breach of the oath of the English Bar
 Council. I need not emphasize to you that the sensitivity of this issue
 need not be toyed with by neglecting its confidentiality. At this point 
 I
 want to assure you that your true consent, full cooperation and
 confidentiality are all that are required for us to take full advantage 
 of
 this great opportunity.

 This is an opportunity that people rarely have.

 I look forward to hearing from you soon.

 Yours truly,
 Barr. Paul Bowen
