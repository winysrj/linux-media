I should clarify: If it smells like the issue is a failure of our
ioctl/syscall validation code to catch crap, BUG_ON is the right
choice. And fundamentally I've had this rule since 1-2 years now, the
only recent change I've done is switch my scripts from warning by
default if there's a new BUG_ON to rejecting by default. Mostly
because I'm lazy and let too many BUG_ONs pass through by default.

Also if you add a new interface to i915 I'll make damn sure you supply
a full set of nasty testcases to abuse the ioctl hard. In the end it's
a tradeoff and overall I don't think I'm compromising security with my
current set of rules.

Also, people don't (yet) terribly care about data integrity as soon as
their data has passed once through a gpu.
