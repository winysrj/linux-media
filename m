WTF?

Eeek, no no no no!

First off, no driver should EVER have to call a "raw" kobject call,
that's a huge sign that you are doing something really really wrong.

Secondly, you NEVER grab a reference to a structure like this, you use
the "correct" driver/bus api calls.

Thirdly, ugh, how to say this nicely...  The whole idea that something
like this could actually be a real solution to a problem is insane.

Look at what you are really doing here, trying to grab an extra
reference on something that in reality, should never go away anyhow.
Your parent structure should already always have the reference count
incremented and will not disappear underneath you at all.  And if this
isn't your "parent", you have no right at all to go grab random
references across the device tree for no reason other than you feel you
don't want it to go away.  If you don't want something to go away, you
properly get the reference (hint, you already should have if you have
this type of pointer chain to the object.)

If this type of solution is somehow the "correct" one, the v4l driver
model interaction is severely broken and needs to be fixed.

What bug is this that caused this type of hack to even be proposed?  Is
it a bug or a regression?  If a regression, can someone show me the
commit that would cause such a monstrosity to be proposed?

Laurent, sorry, I know I said I was going to debug a USB V4L reference
counting problem last week, I had to travel and haven't had the chance
to do so.  I'll try to get to it today.  Hopefully that issue has
nothing to do with this problem.  Because if so, ugh...

Mauro, again, please never propose something like this again.
