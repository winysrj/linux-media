Hi Again
   Yep that fixed pulling in the saa7164: si2168 frontends:

[ 6778.591548] i2c i2c-15: Added multiplexed i2c bus 16
[ 6778.591556] si2168 15-0064: Silicon Labs Si2168 successfully attached
[ 6778.596252] si2157 13-0060: Silicon Labs Si2147/2148/2157/2158 
successfully attached
[ 6778.597229] DVB: registering new adapter (saa7164)
YAY!!

What a painful process... first time I built the kernel from the rpm 
source I must have stuffed something up and the resultant installed rpm 
didn't have the module turned on.. aaarrrrggghhhhh...
Trying to rebuild the srpm again after tweaking the .config file and 
copying it around to the various locations again just didn't work.. 
Eventually gave up and had to rip it all out and start afresh..

Well spotted on that one.. What a pain that the call to the i2c mux 
create didn't result in a error :/

Now I just need to shutoff kernel updates..
Really need to push this up into the centos config.. I've noted that it 
has been turned back on in other releases..
Will submit a bug.

Regards
    Richard Tresidder
