While em28xx driver tries to do its best to detect, devices without
EEPROM will always have issues, as there are lots of similar devices
with small differences on how they were wired up.

That's why em28xx has the "card" modprobe parameter.

Ok, it likely makes sense to add an additional hint based on has_audio.

That is the right thing to do. It makes sense to have it documented at the
Wiki, in order to help others with similar boards.

The driver could be detecting if Realtek alc653 is found, in order to
hint it as "EasyCap":

[ 5568.813055] em28xx #0: AC97 vendor ID = 0x414c4761

If I'm not mistaken, someone wrote at the ML that "EasyCap" is actually 
just a generic name used by some Chinese companies to indicate a video
capture USB device. The fact is that there are EasyCap devices using 
even completely different chipsets.

Cheers,
Mauro
