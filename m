I would rephrase that: (ie. for devices that have other child nodes that
aren't ports.) It isn't about the #address/size-cells values. It is
about how the driver interprets child nodes.

Or the other way around. Make the core function only handle an explicit
location and use a v4l2 wrapper to preserve the current behaviour. That
will encourage stricter usage.

It sounds like that is a closer description of the hardware, so I agree.

Generally I would avoid mixing child nodes of different purposes. If you
are in that situation, the recommendation should be to use a ports node.
If there are any current users for which that doesn't work, only then
would I do the child_by_name approach.
