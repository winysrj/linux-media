Good to know. We're open to patches to improve it. 

The point is that we've got in the past several complains about saa713x
machines hanging due to IRQ's generated by IR sensor port. We ended by adding
an option to disable IR and a code at the driver that disables IR IRQ if it 
happens too often.

Most of the devices that have a hardware IR decodes needs polling. Most of they
simply outputs the scan code on some set of GPIO pins.

In general, the devices with the IR sensor connected to a GPIO pin are IRQ-driven.
