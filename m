I have a smiapp patchset for DT support that I posted a while ago, here:

<URL:http://www.spinics.net/lists/linux-media/msg83285.html>

What's missing on top of that is the omap3isp support, plus something to
toggle the sysctl registers based on the chosen receiver. I have a
preliminary, not RFC yet but functional set here:

<URL:http://vihersipuli.retiisi.org.uk/cgi-bin/gitweb.cgi?p=~sailus/linux.git;a=shortlog;h=refs/heads/rm696-045-dt>

The main camera support requires et8ek8 driver as well, and resolving
the breakage with the image capture on 3430.

N9/N950 will be first, though. Lens controllers are another matter, but
nothing too difficult on that side either.

Me, too. :-)
