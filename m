Agreed that pxa_free_dma() doesn't free anything, that one is easy :)

And agreed too for the second part, with a slighly different explanation :
 - pxa_camera_remove_device() has been called as you said
 - inside this function, check comment
   "/* disable capture, disable interrupts */"
   => this ensures no interrupt can be generated anymore

So after pxa_camera_remove_device() has been called, no interrupts can be
generated.

Yet as you said, it leaves the "almost impossible" scenario :
 - a user begins a capture
 - the user closes the capture device and unloads pxa-camera.ko:
     soc_camera_close()
       pxa_camera_remove_device()
         the IRQ line is asserted but doesn't trigger yet the interrupt handler
         (yes I know, improbable)
         meanwhile, IRQs are disabled, DMA channels are stopped
     switch_to(rmmod)
       => yes I know, impossible, the interrupt handler must be run before, but
       let's continue for love of discussion ...
     rmmod pxa-camera
       pxa_camera_remove()
         pxa_free_dma() * 3
         ----> here the IRQ handler kicks in !!!
               => pxa_camera_irq()
                    pxa_dma_start_channels()
         ----> it hurts !

My call is that this is impossible because the switch_to() should run the IRQ
handler before pxa_camera_remove() is called.

So all this to say that I think we're safe, unless a heavy ion or a cosmic ray
strikes the PXA :)

Cheers.
