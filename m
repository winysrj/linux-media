Hi Roman,

Right, I am so busy that I never look at bugzilla!

Why do bugs appear in zc3xx? This subdriver handles more than one
hundred webcams. Most of the treatment was inherited from the gspca v1
by Michel Xhaard who gave me the sources and let me alone without any
information. In zc3xx, many webcams are driven by sequences copied from
ms-windows USB traces and it is not easy to add them standard controls
such as light frequency filtering. My fault, sometimes, I am too sure of
a change and it goes into a kernel without test. I am a bit more
careful now, and I have about 10 fixes which are waiting for testers..

Otherwise, it seems that the contast problem #24242 was fixed (see
commit 3d244065cb8764e).

But I did not know about this fps problem. May you get the last gspca
test version from my web site and do a usbmon trace? (I need the webcam
connection up to no more than 1 second of streaming)

Regards.
