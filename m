I hope you don't expect to be taken seriously after your absurd
comment.  This conversation is about addressing and finding a solution
to a problem.  I'm not even the person who originally brought up the
solution used in multiproto but as far as I can see, it does seem to
be a great solution so I question why that method shouldn't be
adopted.

It's ridiculous I need to point any of this out to you but one
possible reason is that _you_ are in fact the one trolling here.
Afterall, the only posting you've made has absolutely nothing to do
with the subject, while all of mine do.  Please contribute something
relevant or find some other thread to infect.

And by the way, most of us have accepted the outcome of the
s2api/multiproto controversy.  Maybe it's about time you find a way to
move on as well.  Good luck to you.
