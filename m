This commit adds the Virtual Contiguous Memory framework which
provides an abstraction for virtual address space provided by
various MMUs present on the platform.

The framework uses plugable MMU drivers for hardware MMUs and
if drivers obeys some limitations it can be also used on
platforms with no MMU.

+
+This document covers how to use the Virtual Contiguous Memory Manager
+(VCMM), how the implementation works, and how to implement MMU drivers
+that can be plugged into VCMM.  It also contains a rationale for VCMM.
+
+* The Virtual Contiguous Memory Manager
+
+The VCMM was built to solve the system-wide memory mapping issues that
+occur when many bus-masters have IOMMUs.
+
+An IOMMU maps device addresses to physical addresses.  It also
+insulates the system from spurious or malicious device bus
+transactions and allows fine-grained mapping attribute control.  The
+Linux kernel core does not contain a generic API to handle IOMMU
+mapped memory; device driver writers must implement device specific
+code to interoperate with the Linux kernel core.  As the number of
+IOMMUs increases, coordinating the many address spaces mapped by all
+discrete IOMMUs becomes difficult without in-kernel support.
+
+The VCMM API enables device independent IOMMU control, virtual memory
+manager (VMM) interoperation and non-IOMMU enabled device
+interoperation by treating devices with or without IOMMUs and all CPUs
+with or without MMUs, their mapping contexts and their mappings using
+common abstractions.  Physical hardware is given a generic device type
+and mapping contexts are abstracted into Virtual Contiguous Memory
+(VCM) regions.  Users "reserve" memory from VCMs and "bind" their
+reservations with physical memory.
+
+If drivers limit their use of VCM contexts to a some subset of VCMM
+functionality, they can work with no changes with or without MMU.
+
+** Why the VCMM is Needed
+
+Driver writers who control devices with IOMMUs must contend with
+device control and memory management.  Driver writers have a large
+device driver API that they can leverage to control their devices, but
+they are lacking a unified API to help them program mappings into
+IOMMUs and share those mappings with other devices and CPUs in the
+system.
+
+Sharing is complicated by Linux's CPU-centric VMM.  The CPU-centric
+model generally makes sense because average hardware only contains
+a MMU for the CPU and possibly a graphics MMU.  If every device in the
+system has one or more MMUs the CPU-centric memory management (MM)
+programming model breaks down.
+
+Abstracting IOMMU device programming into a common API has already
+begun in the Linux kernel.  It was built to abstract the difference
+between AMD and Intel IOMMUs to support x86 virtualization on both
+platforms.  The interface is listed in include/linux/iommu.h.  It
+contains interfaces for mapping and unmapping as well as domain
+management.  This interface has not gained widespread use outside the
+x86; PA-RISC, Alpha and SPARC architectures and ARM and PowerPC
+platforms all use their own mapping modules to control their IOMMUs.
+The VCMM contains an IOMMU programming layer, but since its
+abstraction supports map management independent of device control, the
+layer is not used directly.  This higher-level view enables a new
+kernel service, not just an IOMMU interoperation layer.
+
+** The General Idea: Map Management using Graphs
+
+Looking at mapping from a system-wide perspective reveals a general
+graph problem.  The VCMM's API is built to manage the general mapping
+graph.  Each node that talks to memory, either through an MMU or
+directly (physically mapped) can be thought of as the device-end of
+a mapping edge.  The other edge is the physical memory (or
+intermediate virtual space) that is mapped.  The figure below shows
+an example three with CPU and a few devices connected to the memory
+directly or through a MMU.

+
+For each MMU in the system a VCM context is created through an through
+which drivers can make reservations and bind virtual addresses to
+physical space.  In the direct-mapped case the device is assigned
+a one-to-one MMU (as shown on the figure below). This scheme allows
+direct mapped devices to participate in general graph management.

+
+The CPU nodes can also be brought under the same mapping abstraction
+with the use of a light overlay on the existing VMM. This light
+overlay allows VCMM-managed mappings to interoperate with the common
+API.  The light overlay enables this without substantial modifications
+to the existing VMM.
+
+In addition to CPU nodes that are running Linux (and the VMM), remote
+CPU nodes that may be running other operating systems can be brought
+into the general abstraction.  Routing all memory management requests
+from a remote node through the central memory management framework
+enables new features like system-wide memory migration.  This feature
+may only be feasible for large buffers that are managed outside of the
+fast-path, but having remote allocation in a system enables features
+that are impossible to build without it.
+
+The fundamental objects that support graph-based map management are:
+Virtual Contiguous Memory contexts, reservations, and physical memory
+allocations.
+
+* Usage Overview
+
+In a nutshell, platform initialises VCM context for each MMU on the
+system and possibly one-to-one VCM contexts which are passed to device
+drivers.  Later on, drivers make reservation of virtual address space
+from the VCM context.  At this point no physical memory has been
+committed to the reservation.  To bind physical memory with a
+reservation, physical memory is allocated (possibly discontiguous) and
+then bound to the reservation.
+
+Single physical allocation can be bound to several different
+reservations also from different VCM contexts.  This allows for
+devices connected through different MMUs (or directly) to the memory
+banks to share physical memory buffers; this also lets it possible to
+map such memory into CPU's address space (be it kernel or user space)
+so that the same data can be accessed by the CPU.
+
+[[file:../include/linux/vcm.h][include/linux/vcm.h]] includes comments documenting each API.
+
+** Virtual Contiguous Memory context
+
+A Virtual Contiguous Memory context (VCM) abstracts an address space
+a device sees.  A VCM is created with a VCM driver dependent call.  It
+is destroyed with a call to:
+
+        void vcm_destroy(struct vcm *vcm);
+
+The newly created VCM instance can be passed to any function that needs to
+operate on or with a virtual contiguous memory region.  All internals
+of the VCM driver and how the mappings are handled is hidden and VCM
+driver dependent.
+
+** Bindings
+
+If all that driver needs is allocate some physical space and map it
+into its address space, a vcm_make_binding() call can be used:
+
+	struct vcm_res	*__must_check
+	vcm_make_binding(struct vcm *vcm, resource_size_t size,
+			 unsigned alloc_flags, unsigned res_flags);
+
+This call allocates physical memory, reserves virtual address space
+and binds those together.  If all those succeeds a reservation is
+returned which has physical memory associated with it.
+
+If driver does not require more complicated VCMM functionality, it is
+desirable to use this function since it will work on both real MMUs
+and one-to-one mappings.
+
+To destroy created binding, vcm_destroy_binding() can be used:
+
+        void vcm_destroy_binding(struct vcm_res *res);
+
+** Physical memory
+
+Physical memory allocations are handled using the following functions:
+
+	struct vcm_phys *__must_check
+	vcm_alloc(struct vcm *vcm, resource_size_t size, unsigned flags);
+
+	void vcm_free(struct vcm_phys *phys);
+
+It is noteworthy that physical space allocation is done in the context
+of a VCM.  This is especially important in case of one-to-one VCM
+contexts which cannot handle discontiguous physical memory.
+
+Also, depending on VCM context, the physical space may be allocated in
+parts of different sizes.  For instance, if a given MMU supports
+16MiB, 1MiB, 64KiB and 4KiB pages, it is likely that vcm_alloc() in
+context of this MMU's driver will try to split into as few as possible
+parts of those sizes.
+
+In case of one-to-one VCM contexts, a physical memory allocated with
+the call to vcm_alloc() may be usable only with vcm_map() function.
+
+** Mappings
+
+The easiest way to map a physical space into virtual address space
+represented by VCM context is to use the vcm_map() function:
+
+	struct vcm_res *__must_check
+	vcm_map(struct vcm *vcm, struct vcm_phys *phys, unsigned flags);
+
+This functions reserves address space from VCM context and binds
+physical space to it.  To reverse the process vcm_unmap() can be used:
+
+	void vcm_unmap(struct vcm_res *res);
+
+Similarly to vcm_make_binding(), Usage vcm_map() may be advantageous
+over the use of vcm_reserve() followed by vcm_bind().  This is not
+only true for one-to-one mapping but if it so happens that the call to
+vcm_map() request mapping of a physically contiguous space into kernel
+space, a direct mapping can be returned instead of creating a new one.
+
+In some cases, a reservation created with vcm_map() can be used only
+with the physical memory passed as the argument to vcm_map() (so if
+user chooses to call vcm_unbind() and then vcm_bind() on a different
+physical memory, the call may fail).
+
+** Reservations
+
+A reservation is a contiguous region allocated from a virtual address
+space represented by VCM context.  Just after reservation is created,
+no physical memory needs to be is bound to it.  To manage reservations
+following two functions are provided:
+
+	struct vcm_res *__must_check
+	vcm_reserve(struct vcm *vcm, resource_size_t size,
+		    unsigned flags);
+
+	void vcm_unreserve(struct vcm_res *res);
+
+The first one creates a reservation of desired size, and the second
+one destroys it.
+
+** Binding memory
+
+To bind a physical memory into a reservation vcm_bind() function is
+used:
+
+	int __must_check vcm_bind(struct vcm_res *res,
+				  struct vcm_phys *phys);
+
+When the binding is no longer needed, vcm_unbind() destroys the
+connection:
+
+	struct vcm_phys *vcm_unbind(struct vcm_res *res);
+
+** Activating mappings
+
+Unless a VCM context is activated, none of the bindings are actually
+guaranteed to be available.  When device driver needs the mappings
+it need to call vcm_activate() function to guarantee that the mappings
+are sent to hardware MMU.
+
+	int  __must_check vcm_activate(struct vcm *vcm);
+
+After VCM context is activated all further bindings (made with
+vcm_make_binding(), vcm_map() or vcm_bind()) will be updated so there
+is no need to call vcm_activate() after each binding is done or
+undone.
+
+To deactivate the VCM context vcm_deactivate() function is used:
+
+	void vcm_deactivate(struct vcm *vcm);
+
+Both of those functions can be called several times if all calls to
+vcm_activate() are paired with a later call to vcm_deactivate().
+
+** Device driver example
+
+The following is a simple, untested example of how platform and
+devices work together to use the VCM framework.  Platform initialises
+contexts for each MMU in the systems, and through platform device data
+passes them to correct drivers.
+
+Device driver header file:
+
+	struct foo_platform_data {
+		/* ... */
+		struct vcm	*vcm;
+		/* ... */
+	};
+
+Platform code:
+
+	static int plat_bar_vcm_init(void)
+	{
+		struct foo_platform_data *fpdata;
+		struct vcm *vcm;
+
+		vcm = vcm_baz_create(...);
+		if (IS_ERR(vcm))
+			return PTR_ERR(vcm);
+
+		fpdata = dev_get_platdata(&foo_device.dev);
+		fpdata->vcm = vcm;
+
+		/* ... */
+
+		return 0;
+	}
+
+Device driver implementation:
+
+	struct foo_private {
+		/* ... */
+		struct vcm_res	*fw;
+		/* ... */
+	};
+
+	static inline struct vcm_res *__must_check
+	__foo_alloc(struct device *dev, size_t size)
+	{
+		struct foo_platform_data *pdata =
+			dev_get_platdata(dev);
+		return vcm_make_binding(pdata->vcm, size, 0, 0);
+	}
+
+	static inline void __foo_free(struct vcm_res *res)
+	{
+		vcm_destroy_binding(res);
+	}
+
+	static int foo_probe(struct device *dev)
+	{
+		struct foo_platform_data *pdata =
+			dev_get_platdata(dev);
+		struct foo_private *priv;
+
+		if (IS_ERR_OR_NULL(pdata->vcm))
+			return pdata->vcm ? PTR_ERR(pdata->vcm) : -EINVAL;
+
+		priv = kzalloc(sizeof *priv, GFP_KERNEL);
+		if (!priv)
+			return -ENOMEM;
+
+		/* ... */
+
+		priv->fw = __foo_alloc(dev, 1 << 20);
+		if (IS_ERR(priv->fw)) {
+			kfree(priv);
+			return PTR_ERR(priv->fw);
+		}
+		/* copy firmware to fw */
+
+		vcm_activate(pdata->vcm);
+
+		dev->p = priv;
+
+		return 0;
+	}
+
+	static int foo_remove(struct device *dev)
+	{
+		struct foo_platform_data *pdata =
+			dev_get_platdata(dev);
+		struct foo_private *priv = dev->p;
+
+		/* ... */
+
+		vcm_deactivate(pdata->vcm);
+		__foo_free(priv->fw);
+
+		kfree(priv);
+
+		return 0;
+	}
+
+	static int foo_do_something(struct device *dev, /* ... */)
+	{
+		struct foo_platform_data *pdata =
+			dev_get_platdata(dev);
+		struct vcm_res *buf;
+		int ret;
+
+		buf = __foo_alloc(/* ... size ...*/);
+		if (IS_ERR(buf))
+			return ERR_PTR(buf);
+
+		/*
+		 * buf->start is address visible from device's
+		 * perspective.
+		 */
+
+		/* ... set hardware up ... */
+
+		/* ... wait for completion ... */
+
+		__foo_free(buf);
+
+		return ret;
+	}
+
+In the above example only vcm_make_binding() function is used so that
+the above scheme will work not only for systems with MMU but also in
+case of one-to-one VCM context.
+
+** IOMMU, one-to-one and VMM contexts
+
+The following example demonstrates mapping IOMMU, one-to-one and VMM
+reservations to the same physical memory.  For readability, error
+handling is not shown on the listings.
+
+First, each contexts needs to be created.  A call used for creating
+context is dependent on the driver used.  The following is just an
+example of how this could look like:
+
+	struct vcm *vcm_vmm, *vcm_onetoone, *vcm_iommu;
+
+	vcm_vmm      = vcm_vmm_create();
+	vcm_onetoone = vcm_onetoone_create();
+	vcm_iommu    = vcm_foo_mmu_create();
+
+Once contexts are created, physical space needs to be allocated,
+reservations made on each context and physical memory mapped to those
+reservations.  Because there is a one-to-one context, the memory has
+to be allocated from its context.  It's also best to map the memory in
+the single call using vcm_make_binding():
+
+	struct vcm_res *res_onetoone;
+
+	res_onetoone = vcm_make_binding(vcm_o2o, SZ_2MB | SZ_4K, 0, 0);
+
+What's left is map the space in the other two contexts.  If the
+reservation in the other two contexts won't be used for any other
+purpose then to reference the memory allocated in above, it's best to
+use vcm_map():
+
+	struct vcm_res *res_vcm, *res_iommu;
+
+	res_vmm = vcm_map(vcm_vmm, res_onetoone->phys, 0);
+	res_iommu = vcm_map(vcm_iommu, res_onetoone->phys, 0);
+
+Once the bindings have been created, the contexts need to be activated
+to make sure that they are actually on the hardware. (In case of
+one-to-one mapping it's most likely a no-operation but it's still
+required by the VCMM API so it must not be omitted.)
+
+	vcm_activate(vcm_vmm);
+	vcm_activate(vcm_onetoone);
+	vcm_activate(vcm_iommu);
+
+At this point, all three reservations represent addresses in
+respective address space that is bound to a physical memory.  Not only
+CPU can access it now but also devices connected through the MMU, as
+well as devices connected directly to the memory banks.  The bus
+address for the devices and virtual address for the CPU is available
+through the 'start' member of the vcm_res structure (ie. res_* objects
+above).
+
+Once the mapping is no longer used and memory no longer needed it can
+be freed as follows:
+
+	vcm_unmap(res_vmm);
+	vcm_unmap(res_iommu);
+	vcm_destroy_binding(res_onetoone);
+
+If the contexts are not needed either, they can be disabled:
+
+	vcm_deactivate(vcm_vmm);
+	vcm_deactivate(vcm_iommu);
+	vcm_deactivate(vcm_onetoone);
+
+and than, even destroyed:
+
+	vcm_destroy(vcm_vmm);
+	vcm_destroy(vcm_iommu);
+	vcm_destroy(vcm_onetoone);
+
+* Available drivers
+
+The following VCM drivers are provided:
+
+** Real hardware drivers
+
+There are no real hardware drivers at this time.
+
+** One-to-One drivers
+
+As it has been noted, one-to-One drivers are limited in the sense that
+certain operations are very unlikely to succeed.  In fact, it is often
+certain that some operations will fail.  If your driver needs to be
+able to run with One-to-One driver you should limit operations to:
+
+	vcm_make_binding()
+	vcm_destroy_binding()
+
+under some conditions, vcm_map() may also work.
+
+There are no One-to-One drivers at this time.
+
+* Writing a VCM driver
+
+The core of VCMM does not handle communication with the MMU.  For this
+purpose a VCM driver is used.  Its purpose is to manage virtual
+address space reservations, physical allocations as well as updating
+mappings in the hardware MMU.
+
+API designed for VCM drivers is described in the
+[[file:../include/linux/vcm-drv.h][include/linux/vcm-drv.h]] file so it might be a good idea to take a look
+inside.
+
+VCMM provides API for three different kinds of drivers.  The most
+basic is a core VCM which VCMM use directly.  Other then that, VCMM
+provides two wrappers -- VCM MMU and VCM One-to-One -- which can be
+used to create drivers for real hardware VCM contexts and for
+One-to-One contexts.
+
+All of the drivers need to provide a context creation functions which
+will allocate memory, fill start address, size and pointer to driver
+operations, and then call an init function which fills rest of the
+fields and validates entered values.
+
+** Writing a core VCM driver
+
+The core driver needs to provide a context creation function as well
+as at least some of the following operations:
+
+	void (*cleanup)(struct vcm *vcm);
+
+	int (*alloc)(struct vcm *vcm, resource_size_t size,
+		     struct vcm_phys **phys, unsigned alloc_flags,
+		     struct vcm_res **res, unsigned res_flags);
+	struct vcm_res *(*res)(struct vcm *vcm, resource_size_t size,
+			       unsigned flags);
+	struct vcm_phys *(*phys)(struct vcm *vcm, resource_size_t size,
+				 unsigned flags);
+
+	void (*unreserve)(struct vcm_res *res);
+
+	struct vcm_res *(*map)(struct vcm *vcm, struct vcm_phys *phys,
+			       unsigned flags);
+	int (*bind)(struct vcm_res *res, struct vcm_phys *phys);
+	void (*unbind)(struct vcm_res *res);
+
+	int (*activate)(struct vcm *vcm);
+	void (*deactivate)(struct vcm *vcm);
+
+All of the operations (expect for the alloc) may assume that all
+pointer arguments are not-NULL.  (In case of alloc, if any argument is
+NULL it is either phys or res (never both).)
+
+*** Context creation
+
+To use a VCM driver a VCM context has to be provided which is bound to
+the driver.  This is done by a driver-dependent call defined in it's
+header file.  Such a call may take varyous arguments to configure the
+context of the MMU.  Its prototype may look as follows:
+
+	struct vcm *__must_check vcm_samp_create(/* ... */);
+
+The driver will most likely define a structure encapsulating the vcm
+structure (in the usual way).  The context creation function must
+allocate space for such a structure and initialise it correctly
+including all members of the vcm structure expect for activations.
+The activations member is initialised by calling:
+
+	struct vcm *__must_check vcm_init(struct vcm *vcm);
+
+This function also validates that all fields are set correctly.
+
+The driver field of the vcm structure must point to a structure with
+all operations supported by the driver.
+
+If everything succeeds, the function has to return pointer to the vcm
+structure inside the encapsulating structure.  It is the pointer that
+will be passed to all of the driver's operations.  On error,
+a pointer-error must be returned (ie. not NULL).
+
+The function might look something like the following:
+
+	struct vcm *__must_check vcm_foo_create(/* ... */)
+	{
+		struct vcm_foo *foo;
+		struct vcm *vcm;
+
+		foo = kzalloc(sizeof *foo, GFP_KERNEL);
+		if (!foo)
+			return ERR_PTR(-ENOMEM);
+
+		/* ... do stuff ... */
+
+		foo->vcm.start  = /* ... */;
+		foo->vcm.size   = /* ... */;
+		foo->vcm.driver = &vcm_foo_driver;
+
+		vcm = vcm_init(&foo->vcm);
+		if (IS_ERR(vcm)) {
+			/* ... error recovery ... */
+			kfree(foo);
+		}
+		return vcm;
+	}
+
+*** Cleaning up
+
+The cleanup operation is called when the VCM context is destroyed.
+Its purpose is to free all resources acquired when VCM context was
+created including the space for the context structure.  If it is not
+given, the memory is freed using the kfree() function.
+
+*** Allocation and reservations
+
+If alloc operation is specified, res and phys operations are ignored.
+The observable behaviour of the alloc operation should mimic as
+closely as possible res and phys operations called one after the
+other.
+
+The reason for this operation is that in case of one-to-one VCM
+contexts, the driver may not be able to bind together arbitrary
+reservation with an arbitrary physical space.  In one-to-one contexts,
+reservations and physical memory are tight together and need to be
+made at the same time to make binding possible.
+
+The alloc operation may be called with both, res and phys being set,
+or at most one of them being NULL.
+
+The res operation reserves virtual address space in the VCM context.
+The function must set the start and res_size members of the vcm_res
+structure -- all other fields are filled by the VCMM framework.
+
+The phys operation allocates physical space which can later be bound
+to the reservation.  Unless VCM driver needs some special handling of
+physical memory, the vcm_phys_alloc() function can be used:
+
+	struct vcm_phys *__must_check
+	vcm_phys_alloc(resource_size_t size, unsigned flags,
+		       const unsigned char *orders);
+
+The last argument of this function (orders) is an array of orders of
+page sizes that function should try to allocate.  This array must be
+sorted from highest order to lowest and the last entry must be zero.
+
+For instance, an array { 8, 4, 0 } means that the function should try
+and allocate 1MiB, 64KiB and 4KiB pages (this is assuming PAGE_SIZE is
+4KiB which is true for all supported architectures).  For example, if
+requested size is 2MiB and 68 KiB, the function will try to allocate
+two 1MiB pages, one 64KiB page and one 4KiB page.  This may be useful
+when the mapping is written to the MMU since the largest possible
+pages will be used reducing the number of entries.
+
+If phys or alloc callback chooses to allocate physical memory on its
+own, it must provide a free callback along with the vcm_phys
+structure.  The purpose of the callback is, as one may imagine, to
+free allocated space.
+
+All those operations may assume that size is a non-zero and divisible
+by PAGE_SIZE.
+
+*** Binding
+
+The map operation is optional and it joins res and bind operations
+together.  Like alloc operation, this is provided because in case of
+one-to-one mappings, the VCM driver may be unable to bind together
+physical space with an arbitrary reservation.
+
+Moreover, in case of some VCM drivers, a mapping for given physical
+memory can already be present (ie. in case of using VMM).
+
+Reservation created with map operation does not have to be usable
+with any other physical space then the one provided when reservation
+was created.
+
+The bind operation binds given reservation with a given physical
+memory.  The operation may assume that reservation given as an
+argument is not bound to any physical memory.
+
+Whichever of the two operation is used, the binding must be reflected
+on the hardware if the VCM context has been activated.  If VCM context
+has not been activated this is not required.
+
+The vcm_map() function uses map operation if one is provided.
+Otherwise, it falls back to alloc or res operation followed by bind
+operation.  If this is also not possible, -EOPNOTSUPP is returned.
+Similarly, vcm_bind() function uses the bind operation unless it is
+not provided in which case -EOPNOTSUPP is returned.
+
+Also, if alloc operation is not provided but map is, the
+vcm_make_binding() function will use phys and map operations.
+
+*** Freeing resources
+
+The unbind callback removes the binding between reservation and
+a physical memory.  If unbind operation is not provided, VCMM assumes
+that it is a no-operation.
+
+The unreserve callback releases a reservation as well as free
+allocated space for the vcm_res structure.  It is required and if it
+is not provided vcm_unreserve() will generate a warning.
+
+*** Activation
+
+When VCM context is activated, the activate callback is called.  It is
+called only once even if vcm_activate() is called several times on the
+same context.
+
+When VCM context is deactivated (that is, if for each call to
+vcm_activate(), vcm_deactivate() was called) the deactivate callback
+is called.
+
+When VCM context is activated, all bound reservations must be
+reflected on the hardware MMU (if any).  Also, ofter activation, all
+calls to vcm_bind(), vcm_map() or vcm_make_binding() must
+automatically reflect new mappings on the hardware MMU.
+
+Neither of the operations are required and if missing, VCMM will
+assume they are a no-operation and no warning will be generated.
+
+** Writing a hardware MMU driver
+
+It may be undesirable to implement all of the operations that are
+required to create a usable driver.  In case of hardware MMUs a helper
+wrapper driver has been created to make writing real drivers as simple
+as possible.
+
+The wrapper implements most of the functionality of the driver leaving
+only implementation of the actual talking to the hardware MMU in hands
+of programmer.  Reservations managements as general housekeeping is
+already there.
+
+If you want to use this wrapper, you need to select VCM_MMU Kconfig
+option.
+
+*** Context creation
+
+Similarly to normal drivers, MMU driver needs to provide a context
+creation function.  Such a function must provide a vcm_mmu object and
+initialise vcm.start, vcm.size and driver fields of the structure.
+When this is done, vcm_mmu_init() should be called which will
+initialise the rest of the fields and validate entered values:
+
+	struct vcm *__must_check vcm_mmu_init(struct vcm_mmu *mmu);
+
+This is, in fact, very similar to the way standard driver is created.
+
+*** Orders
+
+One of the fields of the vcm_mmu_driver structure is orders.  This is
+an array of orders of pages supported by the hardware MMU.  It must be
+sorted from largest to smallest and zero terminated.
+
+The order is the logarithm with the base two of the size of supported
+page size divided by PAGE_SIZE.  For instance, { 8, 4, 0 } means that
+MMU supports 1MiB, 64KiB and 4KiB pages.
+
+*** Operations
+
+The three operations that MMU wrapper driver uses are:
+
+	void (*cleanup)(struct vcm *vcm);
+
+	int (*activate)(struct vcm_res *res, struct vcm_phys *phys);
+	void (*deactivate)(struct vcm_res *res, struct vcm_phys *phys);
+
+	int (*activate_page)(dma_addr_t vaddr, dma_addr_t paddr,
+			     unsigned order, void *vcm),
+	int (*deactivate_page)(dma_addr_t vaddr, dma_addr_t paddr,
+			       unsigned order, void *vcm),
+
+The first one frees all resources allocated by the context creation
+function (including the structure itself).  If this operation is not
+given, kfree() will be called on vcm_mmu structure.
+
+The activate and deactivate operations are required and they are used
+to update mappings in the MMU.  Whenever binding is activated or
+deactivated the respective operation is called.
+
+To divide mapping into physical pages, vcm_phys_walk() function can be
+used:
+
+	int vcm_phys_walk(dma_addr_t vaddr, const struct vcm_phys *phys,
+			  const unsigned char *orders,
+			  int (*callback)(dma_addr_t vaddr, dma_addr_t paddr,
+					  unsigned order, void *priv),
+			  int (*recovery)(dma_addr_t vaddr, dma_addr_t paddr,
+					  unsigned order, void *priv),
+			  void *priv);
+
+It start from given virtual address and tries to divide allocated
+physical memory to as few pages as possible where order of each page
+is one of the orders specified by orders argument.
+
+It may be easier to implement activate_page and deactivate_page
+operations instead thought.  They are called on each individual page
+rather then the whole mapping.  It basically incorporates call to the
+vcm_phys_walk() function so driver does not need to call it
+explicitly.
+
+** Writing a one-to-one VCM driver
+
+
+
+Similarly to a wrapper for a real hardware MMU a wrapper for
+one-to-one VCM contexts has been created.  It implements all of the
+houskeeping operations and leaves only contiguous memory management
+(that is allocating and freeing contiguous regions).
+
+*** Context creation
+
+As with other drivers, one-to-one driver needs to provide a context
+creation function.  It needs to allocate space for vcm_o2o structure
+and initialise its vcm.start, vcm.end and driver fields.  Calling
+vcm_o2o_init() will fill the other fields and validate entered values:
+
+	struct vcm *__must_check vcm_o2o_init(struct vcm_o2o *o2o);
+
+There are the following three operations used by the wrapper:
+
+	void (*cleanup)(struct vcm *vcm);
+	void *(*alloc)(struct vcm *vcm, struct vcm_phys_part *part,
+		       unsigned flags);
+	void (*free)(struct vcm_phys_part *part, void *priv);
+
+The cleanup operation cleans the context and frees all resources.  If
+not provided, kfree() is used.
+
+The alloc operation allocates physically contiguous memory.  The size
+of requested block is saved in the provided vcm_phys_part structure.
+Inside this structure, the operation must save the physical address of
+the allocated block if allocation succeeds.  On error, the operation
+must return an error-pointer (NULL is treated as success).
+
+The free operation frees the physically contiguous memory that has
+been allocated with alloc.  As arguments, it is given the same
+vcm_phy_part structure that alloc initialised as well as a priv
+argument which is the value returned by alloc operation.
+
+Both, alloc and free, operations are required.
+
+If you want to use this wrapper, you need to select VCM_O2O Kconfig
+option.
+
+* Epilogue
+
+The initial version of the VCMM framework was written by Zach Pfeffer
+<zpfeffer@codeaurora.org>.  It was then redesigned and mostly
+rewritten by Michal Nazarewicz <m.nazarewicz@samsung.com>.
+
+The new version is still lacking a few important features.  Most
+notably, no real hardware MMU has been implemented yet.  This may be
+ported from original Zach's proposal.
+
+Also, support for VMM is lacking.  This is another thing that can be
+ported from Zach's proposal.
