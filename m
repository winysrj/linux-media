That driver is merely a PTP capable MAC driver, nothing more.
Although AVB is in the device name, the driver doesn't implement
anything beyond the PTP bits.

The current raw sockets will work just fine.  Again, there should be a
application that sits in between with the network socket and the audio
interface.

Because the application will use the already existing network and
audio interfaces to configure the system.

So lets get that issue solved before anything else.  It is absolutely
essential for TSN.  Without the synchronization, you are only playing
audio over the network.  We already have software for that.

Because user space is right place to place the knowledge of the myriad
formats and options.

First you say you don't want ot upgrade media applications, but then
you invent a new socket type.  That is a contradiction in terms.

Audio apps already use networking, and they already use the audio
subsystem.  We need to help them get their job done by providing the
missing kernel interfaces.  They don't need extra magic buffering the
kernel.  They already can buffer audio data by themselves.

I have no idea what you are asking here.
 
Sorry,
