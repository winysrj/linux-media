Subject: [RFI] OMAP4 ISS: l3_interrupt_handler Errors due to wrong

Hi,

I am trying to get both CSI2 interfaces up and running through the ISS 
on the v3.16 kernel for the TI OMAP4 Blaze platform (omap4430 ES 2.3 
revision).

Trough a omap_device_build() call (using the "iss" omap_hwmod) I call the 
iss_probe function. It devm_clk_get's both the iss_ctrlclk and the iss_fck. 
Since I am building the kernel with the omap4-sdp-es23plus device tree 
appended, I figured I need to define the iss_fck in the omap44xx-clocks.dtsi 
file, right after the iss_ctrlclk, as following:

iss_fck: iss_fck {
	#clock-cells = <0>;
	compatible = "ti,gate-clock";
	clocks = <&ducati_clk_mux_ck>;
	ti,bit-shift = <1>;
	reg = <0x1020>;
};

For that, I used the information in [1], the TI clock tree tool and the 
Linux documentation.

Now the omap4iss_get() call throws L3 Standard Errors, right after the first 
time the interrupts, set in iss_enable_interrupts, occur. I am pretty sure the 
cause for that is a wrong initialization of the iss_fck (since I haven't 
changed much more), even though the kernel runs through and the 
"cat clk_summary Â¦ grep iss" command in /sys/kernel/debug/clk/ writes:
iss_ctrlclk         0            1    96000000          0
iss_fck             0            1   400000000          0

Could there be an error in the device tree entry stated above? Or might I be 
missing something else? Has anyone ever enabled iss_fck through device tree?

BTW I've also added iss_fck as an opt_clk in omap_hwmod_44xx_data and added 
the clock to the ti_dt_clk struct.

Thanks,
Martin
