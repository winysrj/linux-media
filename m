That's correct. The lower index node (/dev/video0) is a video node, the 
higher videoo node (/dev/video1) is a metadata node.

Exactly.

Sure, with cheese you can specify which camera you need by using its 
--device= parameter. Eventually it's expected, that those programs will be 
updated to recognise metadata nodes and not attempt to use them.
