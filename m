Oh, hmm, I wasn't aware dma_map_resource was exclusively for mapping
P2P. Though it's a bit odd seeing we've been working under the
assumption that PCI P2P is different as it has to translate the PCI bus
address. Where as P2P for devices on other buses is a big unknown.

Yes, well except in our patch-set we can't easily use
dma_map_resources() as we either have SGLs to deal with or we need to
create whole new interfaces to a number of subsystems.

Do they? They don't on any of the Intel machines I'm looking at. The
previous version of the patchset not only required a common upstream
bridge but two layers of upstream bridges on both devices which would
effectively limit transfers to PCIe switches only. But Bjorn did not
like this.

I don't think it's the drivers responsibility to reject P2P . The
topology is what governs support or not. The discussions we had with
Bjorn settled on if the devices are all behind the same bridge they can
communicate with each other. This is essentially guaranteed by the PCI spec.

Well, unfortunately DMA-buf doesn't help for the drivers we are working
with as neither the block layer nor the RDMA subsystem have any
interfaces for it.
