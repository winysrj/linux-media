What I described is the basic memory architecture of Linux. I am not that
familiar with ARM and the issue discussed here. Only got involved because
ZONE_DMA was mentioned. The nature of ZONE_DMA is often misunderstood.

The allocation of the memory banks for the Samsung devices has to fit
somehow into one of these zones. Its probably best to put the memory banks
into ZONE_NORMAL and not have any dependency on ZONE_DMA at all.
