This is indeed high praise coming from such a fine and noble gentlemen like 
yourself. I find myself truly humbled, nay, honored that you've chosen to grace 
us with your presence and thoughts today.

I'm probably not alone when I say that we look forward to your monumental words 
of wisdom, charm and enlightenment that you've recently chosen to share with us 
all. You have a true gift and I can only hope that you continue to share it with 
us all.

Happy Christmas, please give my regards to the wife and kids.
