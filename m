Hi all,

I am considering buying a PCTV teleScope USB DVB-T device (aka "73a")
second-hand:
http://www.pctvsystems.com/Products/ProductsEuropeAsia/Digitalproducts/PCTVTelescope/tabid/163/language/en-GB/Default.aspx

>From http://linuxtv.org/wiki/index.php/DVB-T_USB_Devices I read that
the device is supported since kernel 2.6.26, which looks promising.
However, before I actually buy it, I would love to hear from someone
actually using this device under Linux. Anyone? Is there anything to
worry about, or can I just buy it?

Thanks,
