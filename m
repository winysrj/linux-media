Hi Tom,

if you have a better patch I'd be more than happy to use that one instead,
this one was intended as a stupid search and replace.  The important
part for me is to get the two conversions and the interface removal
in together.

E.g. I've alreayd wondered why the driver requires the exact vector
number for MSI and a variable one for MSI-X, and there certainly is
all kinds of opportunity for cosmetic cleanup.
