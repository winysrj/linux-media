Take a look at the ML. The SoC people discussed a lot about cache
coherency problems and how to solve it. Videobuf2 has a better support
on embedded world. I would take a look on it and see what it does different
than other drivers. Maybe Jonathan Corbet patches for the ccic driver may
help you.

It is probably a good idea to change cx231xx to use videobuf2, in order to
fix this issue.

Thanks,
Mauro
