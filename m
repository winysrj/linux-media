Hello everybody.

This post is not meant as the flame starter, nor is it "I DEMAND" kind
of post - I just would like to know if I can expect support for
Fushicai usbtv007 chipset anytime soon :) (or at all).

This chipset is used in some EasyCap grabber "clones", as described on
the bottom of this page:

Thanks in advance.

Best regards.
