Hmm... PAGE_SIZE alignment is not needed on all places. It is needed only when
DMA is done directly into the buffer, e. g. videobuf2-dma-contig and
videobuf2-dma-sg.

It means that we'll need an extra function for the VB2 memory allocation drivers
to do do the memory-dependent roundups, and a new ancillary function at VB2 core
for the VB2 clients to call to round sizeimage if needed.
