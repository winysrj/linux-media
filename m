What about adding this program to v4l-dvb (under v4l2-apps/util/)?
AFAIK, alevt currently doesn't have a proper site where development
could take place.
I think it would enjoy a better maintenance if it was hosted in vl4-dvb,
and it could be an additional testing tool useful for drivers
development.
And it is GPL-licensed.
