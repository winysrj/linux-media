I'm trying to split the ac97 support into a separate module.
So far I've managed to do this with two different approaches,
but both of them are broken in some way :-(

Couple questions:

1. Is it possible to force two symbols to be both built-in (=y) or both
modules (=m)? This would make one of my solutions work.

2. Do you think it's possible to split this as a module *without*
requesting the driver dynamically? I've tried the same extensions approach
as in em28xx and others, but found some problems with the way
snd-usb-audio driver registers.
 
Thanks,
