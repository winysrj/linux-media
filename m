I didn't forget those, but I thought that we should tackle those later.
It's not so easy to remove the soc-camera dependency from them. I tried
that once, and I think I could only make one or two of those drivers soc-camera
independent :-(

And without hardware you have no idea if they still work.

The code is still available in git, even if we remove them. I don't really
like the idea of keeping code in the kernel that very likely won't work after
the soc-camera dependencies are removed.
