Well, that's the way s_routing is defined. It's the bridge driver's job to
translate between V4L2 inputs/outputs and low-level routing information.

config is normally not used. There are one or two drivers that need it for
additional routing configuration, but it's rare.

Well, first of all your proposed API isn't merged yet, or even posted on the
mailinglist, so it's a bit unfair to require someone else to use it :-)

Also, while I do agree with your proposed new API I am a lot less enthusiastic
about creating yet another duplicate pad op for an existing audio/video routing
op.

The problem is that existing drivers are never updated for the new op and you are
stuck with competing internal APIs. Not nice at all.

Bottom line is that this driver uses s_routing like any other driver currently
in the kernel, so I have no problem with that.

Regards,

	Hans
