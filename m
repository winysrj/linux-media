Hi Hans,

Thanks for this, I'll do as you suggested.

Do you think there is another internal card out there that would do the 
job of capturing raw SD video?

What would you recommend.

I'm currently using the Dazzle DVC100, stripping the case off and 
installing it internally with cable ties.   It's just a bit basic. I'd 
like something a bit more professional like a half-height PCIe board.  
Which is why I selected the ImpactVCB-e, but really I have no attachment 
to it.

Regards

Steve.
