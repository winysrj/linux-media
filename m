I usually set KCONFIG_ALLCONFIG to a file containing the extra options
I want, for another reason: As long as we are building platforms
separately, all{no,yes,mod}config and randconfig will always build
for the versatile platform instead of something more modern.

We could change that and make mach-vexpress the default, but we can
also wait until we have the initial multiplatform support done and
then use that one.

Building vexpress_defconfig (or most other defconfig, I would expect)
works fine with the CMA series applied. This should also work,
but there a few bugs in unrelated device drivers that would need to get
fixed first.

make ARCH=arm CROSS_COMPILE=arm-linux-gnueabi- -sj3 allmodconfig \ 	
	KCONFIG_ALLCONFIG=$PWD/arch/arm/configs/vexpress_defconfig
