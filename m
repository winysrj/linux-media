Hello,

I was just wondering, as there seem a complete driver available for this 
tuner and its CI interface, is anybody actually using this HW with 
MythTV or any other Linux TV solution?

For now, the best CI option card has been the TT-S2-3200, but if this 
relatively new USB card works with HW CAM's too, it would be great news. 
I've been waiting for it for some time, it's a good add-on card for the 
few extra pay-services requiring non-standard CAM's (like DRE for 
Penthouse HD :)).

Do share your experience...
