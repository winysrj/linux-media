Hello,

I have YUAN High-Tech STK7700PH with usb id Bus 002 Device 002: ID 
1164:1f08 YUAN High-Tech Development Co., Ltd

The DVB support for this device is out of the box in Ubuntu but I need 
analog support as there is no DVB in my country Nepal. Radio also 
doesn't work.

Is there any chance for the analog support?
