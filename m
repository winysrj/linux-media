No, that was just FYI. I've asked Halli Manjunatha, the author of that patch
series to make a new version that can be upstreamed. The reason it was stalled
was due to a long discussion at the time how to implement multiple frequency
bands, but now that that has been resolved this patch series can move forward
as well.

I know that other devices (wl128x) also have similar SNR, RSSI functionality.
Halli, can you check if it would make sense to have generic controls for this?

I don't really know whether this is chip specific or not. Halli, do you
have any input on this?

Let's wait what Halli says, but yes, it should be included in the RFC: we
want to know if this should be standardized or not, so it's good to
mention it so people are aware of this.

Ah, so this turns RDS reception on or off. You are right, there is no method
turning this on or off for receivers, only for transmitters.

This should definitely be standardized. Ideally it should be possible to set
this through VIDIOC_S_TUNER, but there isn't any field that can be used for
that. It's possible to add a field, but should we do that just for this?
I'm leaning towards a control.

An alternative is to only turn on RDS processing if read() or poll() is called.
But you might not be able to detect the presence of the RDS channel if RDS
processing is turned off as well, or can you?
