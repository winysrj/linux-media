Hello there,

I am trying figure how to make this remote controller working. I tried
LIRC, but on the website isnt this card in supported controllers.
After apt-getting lirc and depencies. controller isnt reacting. At
least how he should be. If I open terminal, and trying to push
buttons, my PC starts to make interesting sounds :) And after that,
even my keaboard isnt working how it is supposed to. So I dont think
this is the right way. Maybe some kind of reprogramming? Or someone
got config file for it ?

I will be glad for any help, posting image found on google. I know its
not DVB-T card I am writing, but controller looks same. Just for
imagination.

I thanks once more for any reply.

Best regards M. Bojda
