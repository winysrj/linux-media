You probably mean these related V4L patches: 
http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.linux.drivers.video-input-infrastructure/58646 
that base upon of asynchronous V4L2 subdevice probing, referenced above. 
Yes, V4L DT nodes, as documented in 
http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.linux.drivers.video-input-infrastructure/58646/focus=58648 
contain "port" and "endpoint" nodes, that describe the configuration of 
the hardware port and link to devices, connected to it. Not sure how well 
this would work with DT overlays, because endpoint nodes on both sides of 
the video data bus contain references to the other side and I don't know 
whether and how these can be created and / or updated at run-time. 
Otherwise, yes, the approach that we're currently developing on V4L allows 
us to build video data pipelines independent of (sub)device driver probing 
order.
