At least not yet, and part of the reason is that we have no generic means to
pass that to tell which format if actually is and pass that to the user
space.

Also not every SMIA compliant sensor produces metadata at all.

When they do, however, there's often also a footer, of the same format than
the header. Some sensors produce statistics after that footer as well.

How is it being used? It'd be nice to have a guesstimate for different
usages (the original intent vs. how apparently quite a few have understood
it).

The API does not prevent using the same DMA-BUF buffer (nor USERPTR for that
matter) on multiple planes. Then the question would be how would the user
know when to do that and when not. We could add a V4L2_PIX_FMT_FLAG telling
the plane uses the same memory buffer than the previous one, for instance.

Alternatively, one more layer of abstraction could be used: multi-format
planes. That would mean an array of one or more formatted sections inside a
plane.

Assuming it's a separate memory buffer, yes.

For most of the time the hardware can do either one, but there could be
cases where the user would benefit from being able to choose. This can be
made easily by making no difference between a memory buffer with sections of
different formats and several memory buffers with a single format each.

Indeed. That's another interesting matter. Sometimes a part of e.g. a
statistics buffer may be interesting (and available from hardware) before
the entire buffer is done.

That was why the different parts of the frame were split into different
video buffer queues:

<URL:http://www.retiisi.org.uk/v4l2/foil/v4l2-multi-format.pdf>

But it won't help in all cases, like the one described above.

The statistics I mentioned above; they are not related to the header or the
footer. It'd be very good to be able to describe them in a generic way;
adding a header and a footer support now in a way that recognises they're
the header and the footer is unlikely to be meaningfully extendable when
something else comes up.

These are still just examples, we all know hardware engineers have a
virtually unlimited imagination. :-)

I fully agree with the problem statement and the undesirable solution. :-)

I can send an RFC this or the next week, with more detailed description of
the use cases.
