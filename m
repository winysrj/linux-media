Apologies for the delay in response.
Since with cenalloc, the decision of 'which pool to allocate from' is
not with the userspace, but is calculated based on the devices that
attach, the userspace ABI should be just a simple xxx_create, which
returns an fd that'd be the dma-buf fd. That will allow easy sharing
with other dma-buf importers via standard dma-buf API.
