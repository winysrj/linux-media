Okay, but your list is conflating a whole bunch of problems..

 1) How to go from a __user pointer to a p2p DMA address
  a) How to validate, setup iommu and maybe worst case bounce buffer
     these p2p DMAs
 2) How to allow drivers (ie GPU allocator) dynamically
    remap pages in a VMA to/from p2p DMA addresses
 3) How to expose uncachable p2p DMA address to user space via mmap

Hurm, isn't that issue with DAX only to do with being coherent with
the page cache?

A GPU allocator would not use the page cache, it would have to
construct VMAs some other way.

Right. There is no solution to the RDMA MR issue on old hardware. Apps
that are using GPU+RDMA+Old hardware will have to use short lived MRs
and pay that performance cost, or give up on migration.
