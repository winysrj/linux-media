Theodore obviously has very good insight here, but Devin seemed to be a
bit too pessimistic.

At least something to look further into.

A immediate problem I can imagine is, if you use some such over a
capture card, that you don't get the microphone switched on and must
have something else connected to the sound card for it.

Playback of recorded videos with sound should work from such a device
over the capture card, like connected to any recent TV. (preferably the
capture card should have analog audio out in that case)

Cheers,
Hermann
