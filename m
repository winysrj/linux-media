Yeah, that's my feeling, too. Adding mmap sounds like a neat, simple idea,
that could simplify things for simple devices like v4l. But as soon as
you're dealing with a real gpu, nothing is simple. Those who don't believe
this, just take a look at the data upload/download paths in the
open-source i915,nouveau,radeon drivers. Making this fast (and for gpus,
it needs to be fast) requires tons of tricks, special-cases and jumping
through loops.

You absolutely want the device-specific ioctls to do that. Adding a
generic mmap just makes matters worse, especially if userspace expects
this to work synchronized with everything else that is going on.

Cheers, Daniel
