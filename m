I've found large companies shipping lots of hw putting pressure on
other large/small companies seems to be only way this has ever
happened, we'd like to cover that up and say its some great GPL
enforcement thing.

To be honest, author's choice is how I'd treat this.

Personally I think _GPL is broken by design, and that Linus's initial
point for them has been so diluted by random lobby groups asking for
every symbol to be _GPL that they are becoming effectively pointless
now. I also dislike the fact that the lobby groups don't just bring
violators to court. I'm also sure someone like the LF could have a
nice income stream if Linus gave them permission to enforce his
copyrights.

But anyways, has someone checked that iOS or Windows don't have a
fence interface? so we know that this is a Linux only interface and
any works using it are derived? Say the nvidia driver isn't a derived
work now, will using this interface magically translate it into a
derived work, so we can go sue them? I don't think so.

But its up to Maarten and Rob, and if they say no _GPL then I don't
think we should be overriding authors intents.

Dave.
