Thanks for the info, Devin - unfortunately I don't really have the skills 
or knowledge to do any work on the driver development (I wish I did) - as 
you have assessed, analog support isn't my primary interest because of 
the broadcast switch to ATSC here in the US.

If someone else picks up development, that'd be great and if I decide to 
keep the device (I have a son who has a Windows machine so it might be of 
use to him), then I'll be happy to help out with any testing that needs 
to be done.

Thanks again,

Jim
