I started to write a video-formats.xml file (actually I copied the
subdev-formats.xml file and renamed v4l2-mbus into video-bus :-)), but
these files cannot be used without the proper video_api.tmpl file, and
I don't feel like I'm the one that should start writing this
documentation (or at least I'd need some help).

Anyway, even if you think I should write this doc, can we get this
series mainlined first so that my HLCDC driver can make it into 3.19 ?

Best Regards,

Boris
