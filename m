Markus, This is your typical self-serving nonsense and it only serves to confuse 
the non-technical Linux community. Please don't try to spread your non-GPL tree 
and userland rhetoric on the list as it's not welcome.

This mailing list is dedicated the v4l-dvb GPL source code trees and associated 
applications. As far as I'm concerned your opinion is not welcome. Please keep 
all conversation related to promoting and developing the main repositories please.

Peter, Devin is correct. If a vendor will not provide a driver then vote with 
your pocket and buy another product. If you do anything else you're not helping 
the rest of the community.

I (occasionally) speak on behalf of a vendor.

- Steve
