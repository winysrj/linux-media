iirc, the problem was in dmabufmgr, in
dmabufmgr_wait_completed_cpu().. with an absolute timeout, it could
loop over all the fences without having to adjust the timeout for the
elapsed time.  Otherwise it had to adjust the timeout and keep track
of when the timeout elapsed without confusing itself via rollover.
