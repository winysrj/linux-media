Well, it's certainly possible to get it to work if you're willing to
make the investment.  It's just one of those situations where you
realize quickly that you're going to have to be prepared to do *way*
more work than just adding a new board profile.  Just because there
are drivers for the chips on your device doesn't mean that it is
trivial to get working.

Cheers,

Devin
