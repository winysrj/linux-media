Did you find someone willing to work on support for it? Other wise the 
status will have not changed .... The point being, development around 
here is not done like a service centre where you submit an order ticket 
and then come back a little while later to see if its been filled. So 
you're going to have to be proactive, and try to secure help with the 
matter (and there are no guarantees that you will find such) if you are, 
yourself, unable to directly provide/contribute to the development of 
support for the device.

Incidental to your device:
- Mauro is continuing with efforts to further support for devices using 
XC3028 ... so you should heed attention to those developments
- further to our earlier discussion about the MerlinC.rom, mkrufky 
informed me recently that it is actually for the CX23887 ... the CX23887 
apparently has a CX2584x spliced/built into it, and the CX2584x requires 
a firmware.
- in regards to the encoder portion, see stoth's comment here:
