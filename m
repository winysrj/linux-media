Yes.  But it does not read the data from an earlier transfer after 
carrying out a later transfer on the same buffer.

The only possible example would be if the sense buffer for a command 
occupied part of the same block as the data buffer.  But this can't 
happen, because the sense buffer is allocated separately by its own 
kzalloc_node() call in scsi_init_request().
