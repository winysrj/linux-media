Users will find a hard time discovering what delay is needed for each device.

If this is a per-device type property, then it should, instead, be associated
with the device's USB ID.

The better would be to encapsulate it at the USB device table, like adding a
NEED_(extra)_DELAY flag, like:

	{ USB_DEVICE(0x15c2, 0x0036),  .driver_info = NEED_10MS_DELAY },

If such flag is zero (like on all devices where .driver_info is not filled, as
Kernel zeroes the memory on all static vars), then it will keep using 5ms.

Another alternative would be to use .driver_info for the device type, and
add a logic to handle different types with different logic. This is what
mceusb.c does, for example.
