It is called by demodulator and tuner drivers via I2C. One call per one 
register access. Tuner driver is qt1010 and demod driver is zl10353. 
When you perform tune to channel and device is in sleep there is maybe 
100 or more calls. After channel is tuned as OK, application starts 
calling only some signalling statistics from demod, it is usually only 
few calls per sec.

On my experience I cannot say if it is wise to preallocate or not. 
Anyhow, this same apply for all DVB USB drivers.
