Hello all,
Is here anyone with this card please? I have read a lot I have tryed 
setting various options (port0, port1 and qss) but no luck. I have read 
in this list that under certain conditions it is possible to get stereo 
sound out of avertv studio 303 but sometimes it starts producing noyse 
after a bit of watching.

Thanks for the possible replies.

Peter
