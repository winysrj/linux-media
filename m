Hi all,

I try to get a Terratec S7 (which seems to be a Elgato EyeTV Sat) 
working a my new VDR setup based on yaVDR 0.6. Unfortunately, compared 
to the also installed DD cineS2 tuners, the Terratec S7 tuner does not 
seem to work with DVB-S2 channels while the DVB-S channels work.

There has been a posting on this list from november 2014, also 
mentioning this problem, apparently without any reply: 
http://article.gmane.org/gmane.linux.drivers.video-input-infrastructure/84677 
with the headline "Is it fair to say that the Terratec S7 does not in 
fact work with DVB-S2?".

Is there anyone still interested getting this fixed? Unfortunately, 
because I am not a (linux) developer, I could only help with logfiles 
and testing.

Thanks in advance - with kind regards!

Joerg
