Do we really need the dynamic pool for the first version? I would like to
know how much memory can be allocated in GFP_ATOMIC context. What are the
typical sizes of such allocations?

Maybe for the first version a static pool with reasonably small size
(like 128KiB) will be more than enough? This size can be even board
depended or changed with kernel command line for systems that really
needs more memory.

I noticed one more problem. The size of the CMA managed area must be
the multiple of 16MiBs (MAX_ORDER+1). This means that the smallest CMA area
is 16MiB. These values comes from the internals of the kernel memory 
management design and page blocks are the only entities that can be managed
with page migration code.

I'm not sure if all ARMv6+ boards have at least 32MiB of memory be able to
create a CMA area.

Best regards
