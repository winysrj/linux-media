I'm OK with it.

I haven't been paying close attention,so I must ask: What will the units
of duration be?

a. If we use nanoseconds the max duration is 2.147 seconds.

If passing pulse measurments out to LIRC, there are cases where irrecord
and lircd want the duration of the long silence between the
transmissions from the remote. Do any remotes have silence periods
longer than 2.1 seconds?

b. If we use microseconds, the max duration is 214.7 seconds or 3.6
minutes.  That's too high to be useful.

c.  Something in between, like 1/8 (or 1/2, 1/4, or 1/10) of a
microsecond?  1/8 gives a max duration of 26.8 seconds and a little
extra precision.

Regards,
Andy
