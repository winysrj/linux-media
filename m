The patches look sane, but, please send one patch per email. Otherwise,
only the first patch will be caught by patchwork:
	https://patchwork.kernel.org/patch/796522/

Also, please sign your patches (with Signed-off-by:) and send them in-lined,
otherwise replies (like this one) become very bad, as the patch is not replied
on most email clients used by developers.

Thanks,
Mauro.
