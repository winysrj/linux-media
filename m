Hi Hans,

thank you very much for your review and your patience.

I tried to do smaller patch but there is always some incoherent part 
and the driver cannot work without all the patches. I should write 
some "fake" patches to make a coherent series.
I reduce the size of the patch since v4/5; I leaved 
unchanged some code/comments to simplify the patch.

Tested every time I sent a patch
