Glad to see someone thinking the same way ;-) Thanks for trying it and
particularly for the fixes in vexpress-* code. I'll keep them in mind
when the time comes :-)

Of course neither the CDF patch nor the HDLCD driver are upstream yet.
Laurent promised to post next (hopefully final ;-) version of his
patches soon, but the API has apparently changed so we'll have to adapt
to it. As to the HDLCD driver - there is some work going on converting
it to DRM/KMS and upstreaming as such, using CDF if it's available by
that time as well.
