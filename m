Ah, yes. Anyway, a latter patch changes it to:

	<entry>EFAULT</entry>
	<entry>There was a failure while copying data from/to userspace.</entry>
      </row>

referencing a parameter name there is a bad thing anyway, as this is now at the common
ioctl error code.

Instead of just using a posix-like error code:
	EFAULT          Bad address (POSIX.1)

I opted to use a more valuable description, explaining the reason for such error,
e. g. that there was a failure at the data copy from/to userspace.

It may be better to change it to:

	<entry>EFAULT</entry>
	<entry>There was a failure while copying data from/to userspace, probably
		caused by an invalid pointer reference.</entry>

I think I'll add the above description at the latter patch.

I was intending to add there the other possible error causes found at V4L/DVB API's
and drivers, but the changes I did took me a longer time than I was expecting
originally.  I'll eventually do that when I have more time. 

It would be really great if we could find some volunteer to help syncing 
the media API specs with the code.

Fixed. 

Thanks!
