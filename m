You're correct that only the gpu knows how to put things into the tiler
(and maybe other devices that have access to it). Let me expand my diagram
so that you're webcam fits into the picture.

 	mem <-+-> tiling iommu <-+-> gpu
 	      |                  |
 	      |                  +-> scanout engine

              |                  +-> mpeg decoder
              |                  |                
              |                  |                
              +-> direct dma   <-+
              |                                  
              +-> iommua A <-+-> usb hci                                   
                             |                    
                             +-> other devices                   
                             |                    
                             ...                    

A few notes:
- might not be exactly how omap really looks like
- the devices behind tiler have different device address space windows to
  access the different paths to main memory. No other device can access
  the tiler, iirc.
- your webcam doesn't exist on this because we can't dma from it's memory,
  we can only zero-copy from the memory the usb hci transferred the frame
  to.

Now when when e.g. the scanout engine calls get_scatterlist you only call
dma_map_sg (which does nothing, because there's no iommu that's managed by
the core kernel code for it). The scanout engine will then complain that
your stuff is not contiguous and bail out. Or it is indeed contiguous and
things Just Work.

The much more interesting case is when the mpeg decoder and the gpu share
a buffer (think video on rotating cube or whatever other gui transition
you fancy). Then the omap tiler code can check whether the the device sits
behind the tiler (e.g. with some omap-specific device tree attribute) and
hand out a linear view to a tiled buffer.

In other words, whereever you're currently calling one of the map/unmap
dma api variants, you would call get/put_scatterlist (or better the new
name I'm proposing). So I also don't see your argument about only the
client knows how to map something into address space.

Yours, Daniel
