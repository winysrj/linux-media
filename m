This naming already has been commented, but what do you think: should
the type explicitly tell what kind of interface, if any, is exported to
user space?

Only MEDIA_ENTITY_NODE_* types do this currently, and
MEDIA_ENTITY_TYPE_SUBDEV_* to some extent, but the way is not consistent
at the moment. MEDIA_ENTITY_NODE_* range has lost of different
interfaces whereas MEDIA_ENTITY_TYPE_SUBDEV_* are basically offering
v4l2_subdev and beyond that, suggesting what kind of controls might be
found from the nodes.

I would expect that the interfaces offered by the character devices
would be somewhat standardised in the end like v4l2_subdev user space
interface.

The types above are mostly describing the role of an entity, which might
be interesting as well.
