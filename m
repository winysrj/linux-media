I'm not sure about the direction information (it also came up when we
originally discussed this binding), but the port type information would
be useful. As it turns out, it is not always possible to describe a data
bus interface type/data transmission protocol with a set of primitive
properties in an endpoint node. Especially in cases when the physical
layer is basically identical, for instance in case of MIPI CSI-2 and
SMIA CCP2, or in future MIPI CSI-3 and MIPI CSI-2.

In general there could likely be more than one supported, if both the
transmitter and the receiver are sufficiently configurable.

Then, to be able to fully describe a data port, perhaps we could
add a property like 'interface-type' or 'bus-type' with values like
"mipi-dbi", mipi-dsi", "mipi-csi2", "smia-ccp2", "hdmi", etc.
