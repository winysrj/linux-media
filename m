I agree completely with that.

Right.

This was the first thing raised in the initial discussions. My suggestion at
the time was to give userspace limited information about the buffer restrictions:
Physically contiguous, scatter-gather and 'weird'. But obviously you need
segment_boundary_mask and max_segment_size as well.

And the application can decide based on that info which device has the most
restrictive requirements and make that the exporter.

I am not sure whether there is any sense in exporting the max_segment_count
to userspace (probably not), but I see no reason why we can't set it internally.
That said, a single flag is OK for me as well.

Yes, that was the initial plan.

Well, yes, but it doesn't hurt to sync which DMA parameters are exposed with
what dma-buf uses.

I don't care which ioctl or other mechanism a subsystem uses to expose the
information. Each subsystem should design their own method for that. Imposing
a standard API for that generally doesn't work for the reasons you give.

But deciding *which* minimum set of information is exposed, that is another
matter and that should be synced. And the easiest starting point for that is
that the device will store that information internally in device_dma_parameters.

The various subsystems can then make APIs to expose that info.
