The move to subdev notifiers fixes one assumption of OF graph parsing.
If a subdevice has non-video related ports, the subdev driver knows not
to follow those ports when adding remote devices to its subdev notifier.

   While this approach allows support for arbitrary OF graphs, there
   are some assumptions for this to work:
 
-  1. All port parent nodes reachable in the graph from the IPU CSI

-     If a device has mixed-use ports such as video plus audio, the
-     endpoints from the audio ports are followed to devices that must
-     bind to V4L2 subdevice drivers, and not for example, to an ALSA
-     driver or a non-V4L2 media driver. If the device were bound to
-     such a driver, imx-media would never get an async completion
-     notification because the device fwnode was added to the async
-     list, but the driver does not interface with the V4L2 async
-     framework.

-  2. Every port reachable in the graph is treated as a media pad,
-     owned by the V4L2 subdevice that is bound to the port's parent.

      possible long-term solution is to implement a subdev API that
