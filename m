Without knowing the kernel version on your mythbuntu I can't tell
anything.

For what I know so far, all HVR 1110 variants should be supported with
recent v4l-dvb code.

We run into some maintenance trouble, because we don't know on which of
those are additional LNAs, maybe even different types of LNAs.

Currently it looks like that we have some Pinnacle 310i devices broken
in favour to have in detail unknown HVR 1110 boards working with LNA
support.

It would be much better to escape from such and not to add more and more
unclear hardware on it.

For broken Pinnacle LNA devices are patches to test available to get
them back, others still do work unchanged, also to enable antenna
voltage for those in need of it is possible.

You should try your HVR 1110 variant with recent code and report again
with details from dmesg for it, if it still should fail.

Cheers,
Hermann
