Ah, ok. 

My question really was whether there even was sense for a trylock with
context. I couldn't come up with a case for it; but I think I see one
now.

The thing is; if there could exist something like:

  ww_mutex_trylock(struct ww_mutex *, struct ww_acquire_ctx *ctx);

Then we should not now take away that name and make it mean something
else; namely: ww_mutex_trylock_single().

Unless we want to allow .ctx=NULL to mean _single.

As to why I proposed that (.ctx=NULL meaning _single); I suppose because
I'm a minimalist at heart.
