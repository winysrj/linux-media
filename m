If cropcap returns -EINVAL then that means that the current input or output does
not support cropping (for input) or composing (for output). In that case the
pixel aspect ratio is undefined and you have no way to get hold of that information,
which is a bug in the V4L2 API.

In the case of an m2m device you can safely assume that whatever the pixel aspect
is of the image you give to the m2m device, it will still be the same pixel
aspect when you get it back. In fact, I would say that if an m2m device returns
cropcap information, then the pixel aspect ratio information is most likely not
applicable to the device and will typically be 1:1.

Pixel aspect ratio is only relevant if the video comes in or goes out to a physical
interface (sensor, video receiver/transmitter).
