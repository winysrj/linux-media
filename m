Kishon, I think what Greg means is this:  The name you are using must
be stored somewhere in a data structure constructed by the board file,
right?  Or at least, associated with some data structure somehow.  
Otherwise the platform code wouldn't know which PHY hardware
corresponded to a particular name.

Greg's suggestion is that you store the address of that data structure 
in the platform data instead of storing the name string.  Have the 
consumer pass the data structure's address when it calls phy_create, 
instead of passing the name.  Then you don't have to worry about two 
PHYs accidentally ending up with the same name or any other similar 
problems.
