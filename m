Yes, but the thing is that somebody needs to manually update me about status change,
as patchwork doesn't provide any way for it. Patchwork's permission for a project
is all or nothing: or you completely own a project, or you have just read-only
access. There's no way, currently, for me to delegate a patch to someone without
allowing that person to touch at the non-delegated patches. Also, patchwork
also doesn't allow me to change contributor status (there's just one global admin
that creates and/or modifies account access on patchwork).

Anyway, I've updated the status for #244201.

Thanks,
Mauro.
