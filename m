I'm not disagreeing, but what is actually the distinction between types
and subtypes?  ;-)

I'm imagining a "read-the-properties" ioctl that just returns the
entity's blob.

Headphone jacks are jacks; there are also USB headphones.

These come from the USB audio spec.  Video devices are indeed likely to
be more detailed than just a single audio source. :)

I was aiming for more descriptive names, but I agree that the original
names might be more useful.

Probably not, because there are combined audio/video jacks, any maybe
other entities.

USB and HDA entities already have numeric IDs.

Then those would get different IDs; USB descriptors always describe the
entire device.
