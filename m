Yes, but we already have "secam=" option, and
also the first scan, that is being done on driver
init, scans too much without that option, and
sometimes, unfortunately, detects the PAL carrier
for me.
By limiting it to secam, I avoid the problem and
shorten the scan time.
But this patch is not very important, so do whatever
you think necessary with it.

Thanks!
Of course, in my view, the _only_ right direction is
to export the mute control to the alsa mixer and then
fix mplayer. But at least I'm glad I've managed to
find the hack that satisfies your opinion and works
around the problem at the same time.
