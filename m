For the purposes of review, have a separate patch for moving
isolate_freepages_block to another file that does not alter the
function in any way. When the function is updated in a follow-on patch,
it'll be far easier to see what has changed.

page_isolation.c may also be a better fit than page_alloc.c

As it is, the patch for isolate_freepages_block is almost impossible
to read because it's getting munged with existing code that is already
in page_alloc.c . About all I caught from it is that scannedp does
not have a type. It defaults to unsigned int but it's unnecessarily
obscure.

I haven't actually read the function because it's too badly mixed with
page_alloc.c code but this description fits what I'm looking for.

This is fine. Later, the flags that determine what happens to pageblocks
may be placed in compact_control.

I confess I didn't read closely because of the mess in page_alloc.c but
the intent seems fine. Hopefully there will be a new version of CMA
posted that will be easier to review.
