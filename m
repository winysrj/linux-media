Getting a bit offtopic here, but no a try_disconnect will fix the
userspace stillcam mode driver being able to disconnect the device
while the webcam function is active. If the webcam is not active
userspace will still "win", and possibly never return the device
back to the kernel driver (this already happens today with
gvfs-gphoto creating a fuse mount and keeping the device open
indefinitely, locking out the webcam function).

Likewise a v4l2 control panel like app (think alsamixer for
videodevs to set brightness / contrast, etc.) can keep the /dev/video
node open indefinitely. Unless we rewrite most of userspace, we need
to allow the device to be open in bode modes *at the same time* and
only fail with -EBUSY when something really exclusive is requested
(so not just having the device open, or setting contrast, but
trying to stream and read/delete pictures from the stillcam
memory at the same time).

Regards,

Hans
