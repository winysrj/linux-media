I'm perfectly aware of the issues with aliasing of cache attributes.

My idea is to change low memory linear mapping for all CMA areas on boot
time to use 2 level page tables (4KiB mappings instead of super-section
mappings). This way the page properties for a single page in CMA area can
be changed/updated at any time to match required coherent/writecombine
attributes. Linear mapping can be even removed completely if we want to 
create the it elsewhere in the address space. 

The only problem that might need to be resolved is GFP_ATOMIC allocation
(updating page properties probably requires some locking), but it can be
served from a special area which is created on boot without low-memory
mapping at all. None sane driver will call dma_alloc_coherent(GFP_ATOMIC)
for large buffers anyway.

CMA limits the memory area from which coherent pages are being taken quite
well, so the change in the linear mapping method should have no significant
impact on the system performance.

I didn't implement such solution yet, because it is really hard to handle
all issues at the same time and creating the allocator was just a first
step.
