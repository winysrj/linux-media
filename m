The omap3isp/xclk clock branch was used only to push patches to the media 
tree, I should have deleted it afterwards. Mike's reentrancy patches were 
already merged (or scheduled for merge) in mainline at that time, and for 
technical reasons they were not present in the omap3isp/xclk branch.

I've now deleted the branch from the public tree, sorry for the confusion.
