Not sure what happened there: I couldn't see this specific patch. Yet,
at least some of the changes there seem to be applied. My guess is that
somehow, this patch got merged with some other patch, or maybe the
conflicts solving when the vbi-merge patches got applied (partially)
fixed it.

In any case, you'll need to rebase it, as it doesn't apply anymore.


Cheers,
Mauro
