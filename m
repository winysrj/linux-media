Hi All,

This series enable Gen3 VIN support in rcar-vin driver for Renesas 
r8a7795 and r8a7796. It is based on top of v4.9-rc3.

Parts of this series was previously part of an different series from me 
which enabled Gen3 support in a different way (using s_input instead of 
a media controller) but after feedback during ELCE the Gen3 enablement 
is now almost completely rewritten.

 Patch 1-2: pick-up media entity features from Laurent which the driver 
 depends on.

 Patch 3-5: fix small issues in the driver.

 Patch 6-13: changes the driver from attaching to a video source 
 subdevice at probe time to when the video device node (/dev/videoX) are 
 opened. It also allows for the subdevice which is attached is not the 
 same as last time it was opened, but only at the time the first user 
 opens, i.e. when v4l2_fh_is_singular_file() is true.

 Patch 14-15: prepare the internal data structures for Gen3.

 Patch 16-17: small refactoring preparing for Gen3 additions.

 Patch 18-19: add logic to work with the Gen3 hardware registers

 Patch 20-24: add media control support, link setup and link notify 
 handlers.

 Patch 25-29: add logic to the driver to work together with the media 
 controller.

 Patch 30-32: document the new Gen3 DT bindings, add r8a7795 and r8a7796 
 definitions and device info structures.

The driver is tested on both Renesas H3 (r8a7795) and M3-W (r8a7796) 
together with the new rcar-csi2 driver (posted separately) and a 
prototype driver of the ADV7482 (not ready for upstream but publicly 
available). It is possible to capture both CVBS and HDMI video streams, 
v4l2-compliance passes with no errors (there is one warning due the 
ADV7482 driver) and media-ctl can be used to change the routing from the 
different CSI-2 sources to the different VIN consumers.

Gen2 compatibility is verified on Koelsch and no problems where found, 
video can be captured just like before and v4l2-compliance passes 
without errors or warnings.
