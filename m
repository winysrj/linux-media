Beloved,
I am writing this mail to you with heavy tears in my eyes and great
sorrow in my heart.  As I informed you earlier, I am (Mrs.)Marianne 
Jeanne, 
suffering from long time Cancer. From all indications 
my condition is really deteriorating and it's quite obvious 
that I won't live more than 2 months according to my doctors.

I have some funds I inherited from my late loving husband Mr. Jeanne
Smith, the sum of ($8.5000.000) which he deposited in a Bank. I need
a very honest and God fearing person that can use these funds for
Charity work, helping the Less Privileges, and 20% of this money will
be for your time and expenses, while 80% goes to charities.

Please let me know if I can TRUST YOU ON THIS to carry out this favour
for me.  I look forward to your prompt reply for more details.

Yours sincerely
Marianne Jeanne
