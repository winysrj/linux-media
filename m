Subject: [PATCH/RFC v3 0/5] LED / flash API integration
Date: Fri, 11 Apr 2014 16:56:51 +0200

This is is the third version of the patch series being a follow up
of the discussion on Media summit 2013-10-23, related to the
LED / flash API integration (the notes from the discussion were
enclosed in the message [1], paragraph 5).
The series is based on linux-next next-20140328

Description of the proposed modifications according to
the kernel components they are relevant to:
    - LED subsystem modifications
        * added led_flash module which, when enabled in the config,
	  registers flash specific sysfs attributes:
            - flash_brightness
	    - max_flash_brightness
	    - indicator_brightness
	    - max_indicator_brightness
            - flash_timeout
            - max_flash_timeout
	    - flash_strobe
            - flash_fault
            - external_strobe
	and exposes kernel internal API
            - led_set_flash_strobe
            - led_get_flash_strobe
            - led_set_indicator_brightness
            - led_update_indicator_brightness
            - led_set_flash_timeout
            - led_get_flash_fault
            - led_set_external_strobe
            - led_sysfs_lock
            - led_sysfs_unlock
    - Addition of a V4L2 Flash sub-device registration helpers
        * added v4l2-flash.c and v4l2-flash.h files with helper
          functions that facilitate registration/unregistration
          of a subdevice, which wrapps a LED subsystem device and
          exposes V4L2 Flash control interface
    - Addition of a driver for the flash cell of the MAX77693 mfd
        * the driver exploits the newly introduced mechanism
    - Update of the max77693.txt DT bindings documentation

================
Changes since v2
================

    - refactored the code so that it is possible to build
      led-core without led-flash module
    - added v4l2-flash ops which slackens dependency from
      the led-flash module
    - implemented led_clamp_align_val function and led_ctrl
      structure which allows to align led control values
      in the manner compatible with V4L2 Flash controls;
      the flash brightness and timeout units have been defined
      as microamperes and microseconds respectively to properly
      support devices which define current and time levels
      as fractions of 1/1000.
    - added support for the flash privacy leds
    - modified LED sysfs locking mechanism - now it locks/unlocks
      the interface on V4L2 Flash sub-device file open/close
    - changed hw_triggered attribute name to external_strobe,
      which maps on the V4L2_FLASH_STROBE_SOURCE_EXTERNAL name 
      more intuitively
    - made external_strobe and indicator related sysfs attributes
      created optionally only if related features are declared
      by the led device driver
    - removed from the series patches modifying exynos4-is media
      controller - a proposal for "flash manager" which will take
      care of flash devices registration is due to be submitted
    - removed modifications to the LED class devices documentation,
      it will be covered after the whole functionality is accepted

Thanks,
Jacek Anaszewski
