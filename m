After upgrading to Fedora 10 I am no longer able to tune analog or dvb 
channels using my KWorld ATSC 115. When I try to view a channel with 
tvtime all I can see is static and when I try to scandvb I keep getting 
tuning failed even though I know that there are channels being broadcast 
on the channels scanned. I have tried to find tips on the wiki of how to 
resolve my static problem but I could not find any. I'm not sure where 
to look for clues as to why it isn't working.

I have a 1-to-4 splitter with 2 outputs going to the inputs of the 
KWorld ATSC and another going to a TV so I know there is signal on the 
cable.

Any help would be really appreciated.

Thanks,
-josh
