well, the mmap is actually implemented by the buffer allocator
(v4l/drm).. although not sure if this was the point

The intent was that this is for well defined formats.. ie. it would
need to be a format that both v4l and drm understood in the first
place for sharing to make sense at all..

Anyways, the basic reason is to handle random edge cases where you
need sw access to the buffer.  For example, you are decoding video and
pull out a frame to generate a thumbnail w/ a sw jpeg encoder..

On gstreamer 0.11 branch, for example, there is already a map/unmap
virtual method on the gst buffer for sw access (ie. same purpose as
PrepareAccess/FinishAccess in EXA).  The idea w/ dmabuf mmap() support
is that we could implement support to mmap()/munmap() before/after sw
access.

With this current scheme, synchronization could be handled in
dmabufops->mmap() and vm_ops->close()..  it is perhaps a bit heavy to
require mmap/munmap for each sw access, but I suppose this isn't
really for the high-performance use case.  It is just so that some
random bit of sw that gets passed a dmabuf handle without knowing who
allocated it can have sw access if really needed.
