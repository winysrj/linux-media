Possibly. In any case, if we keep this operation as-is, I wouldn't try
to split the logic between the subdev drivers and the core, that would
be asking for trouble. If it gets too complex to implement for subdev
drivers, then we need a different operation with a different logic in
the subdev API, and a helper that wraps around it.

I would certainly drop 15/30, and I don't think ordering by value would
help subdev drivers much.
