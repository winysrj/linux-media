Yup.  Nobody really maintains the poll/select code.  It happens to sit
under fs/ so nominally belongs to the "fs maintainers".  The logs for
fs/select.c seem to show me as the usual committer, but I wouldn't
claim particular expertise in this area - I'm more a tube-unclogger
here.  Probably Al knows the code as well or better than anyone else. 
It's good that he looked at an earlier version of the patches.

fs/eventpoll.c has an identified maintainer, but he has been vigorously
hiding from us for a year or so.  I'm the commit monkey for eventpoll,
in a similar state to fs/select.c.

So ho hum, all we can do is our best.  You're an experienced kernel
developer who has put a lot of work into the code.  I suggest that you
get your preferred version into linux-next ASAP then send Linus a pull
request for 3.4-rc1, explaining the situation.  If the code wasn't
already in linux-next I would put it in -mm today, for 3.4-rc1.
