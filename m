Hi!

This is not really clear. Does flash_timeout or flash_brightness need
to be set, first?

Do we really want to have separate indicator brightnesses in uA?
Should we maybe reuse existing "brightness" parameter for torch and
indication, maybe adding single (RO) indicator_brightness attribute?

How are faults cleared? Should it be list of strings, instead of
bitmask? We may want to add new fault modes in future...
