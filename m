The main problem is of course fragmentation, for this there is no 
solution in CMA. It has a feature intended to at least reduce memory 
usage though, if only a little bit. It is region sharing. It allows 
platform architects to define regions shared by more than one driver, as 
explained by Michal in the RFC. So we can at least try to reuse each 
chunk of memory as much as possible and not hold separate regions for 
each driver when they are not intended to work simultaneously. Not a 
silver bullet, but is there any though?

I am working on new videobuf which will (hopefully) Just Work. CMA is 
intended to be pluggable into it, as should be any other allocator for 
that matter.
