Hi!

I noticed that support for Terratec H7 arrived not long ago. Thank you 
very much.

It works very well in kaffeine and gnutv(the only applications tested at 
the moment). I have tried it with DVB-C without any problems as long as 
I choose unencrypted channels.
I haven't tried DVB-T but I guess it will work too. I do have access to 
it if testing is needed.

I now wonder if CI support is planned to get implemented?
It is a feature I am missing.

I have access to DVB-C in both unencrypted and encrypted channels and 
may be able to help in testing.
I have access to a Smit CAM(conax) if that does matter. I may be able to 
test encrypted DVB-T too but since I'm not using that at the moment I'm 
not sure I have the right CAM.
