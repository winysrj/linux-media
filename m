Let me personally extend my gratitude and thanks to you for
any and all work you've done, and I'm sure that others feel
the same way.  And that goes for anyone else too who
contributes, no matter whether I can leech from your hard
labour or not.

I've just spent quite a bit of time kicking myself rather
mercilessly around the face and groin area, and I must say,
it's rather painful.  Oh well, you lose some and I lose
some.


Which brings me to ask, in case someone out there might
know -- is anyone familiar with the
Pinnacle PCTV Quatro 73A, DVB-T/DVB-C/analog, USB 2.0
device, recently introduced, primarily in german-speaking
areas of europe and nearby?

Would this be yet another Empia+Micronas product, similar
to the other two I've asked about?


thanks

wanders off muttering about how dissatisfying it is to
throw a USB stick out the window; oh how I miss being able
to hurl a rack filled with valves (tubes for you wrong-
pondians) and chokes and real transformers leaking oily
PCBs down to the parking lot below.  I mean, I could fill
the hole made there by Real Equipment with dozens of these
unsupported USB sticks.  And usually I could just clamp
a bus-bar back onto the Real Equipment and pass a few
hundred amperes through it like new, after hauling it back
up the twenty flights of stairs.  mutter grumble
