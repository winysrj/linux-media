Weird, as reported by Sebastian, it works for me.

However, after applying this patch I get these new warnings:

  CC      drivers/media/radio/si4713/radio-usb-si4713.o
drivers/media/radio/si4713/si4713.c: In function ‘si4713_probe’:
drivers/media/radio/si4713/si4713.c:1617:1: warning: label ‘free_gpio’ defined but not used [-Wunused-label]
 free_gpio:
 ^
drivers/media/radio/si4713/si4713.c:1451:12: warning: unused variable ‘i’ [-Wunused-variable]
  int rval, i;
            ^

So it's probably not a good idea to merge this patch anyway until this is fixed.

Sebastian, can you fix these warnings and repost?

Thanks!

	Hans
