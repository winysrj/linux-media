Well, maybe that is the true in some cases.  But it certainly didn't
work out that way for dma-buf.  And I think the end result is worse.

I don't really like coming down on the side of EXPORT_SYMBOL() instead
of EXPORT_SYMBOL_GPL(), but if we do use EXPORT_SYMBOL_GPL() then the
result will only be creative workarounds using the _GPL symbols
indirectly by whatever is available via EXPORT_SYMBOL().  I don't
really see how that will be better.

heh, and in fact I was wrong about this.. the __ versions are actually
for when the lock is already held.  Maarten needs to rename (ie
_locked suffix) and add some API docs for this.

"can be" == "depends on how the driver uses fence".  Ie. if it is only
used for buffers that are shared between devices, I wouldn't expect it
to matter.

I believe that Maarten did some measurements at some point, which
might be relevant..

At any rate, fences certainly aren't something new to graphics
drivers.  And at least in the case of TTM we are replacing code that
is directly inline with various parts of TTM with calls to static
inline fence fxns.  So for those starting w/ static-inline seems more
reasonable.. to *not* inline would be the bigger deviation from how
things work now.

fair enough.. although inline fxns here are not particularly large,
and since this is something we are retrofitting to TTM I think it is
not unreasonable to start with static-inline until proven otherwise
;-)
