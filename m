Mauro,

I was somewhat alerted by GPL m$ "mediaportal" not to use a rotor on
cards, except you know exactly they can stand it.

The Asus 3in1, still OEM only, but consumer cards are ready, has only
support for 500 mA current.

The LNB supply on it seems to have protection against over current usage
and Asus also does not give any warnings for such cards in that
direction.

Most likely no trouble ever.

Cheers,
Hermann
