Hi again,

Sorry for the noise, but I believe the information below may be useful 
until everything is merged into mainline.

I write to say that I managed to find a fix for the ISP clock deadlock. 
  My branch can be found at:
https://github.com/LoEE/linux/tree/omap3isp/xclk
(SHA: 36286390193922d148e7a3db0676747a20f2ed66 at the time of writing)

For reference:
1. This was a known problem since early January [1] (reported by Laurent).
2. Mike Turquette had submitted patches that made the clock framework 
(partially) reentrant. [2][3][4]
3. My code is just a rebase of the Laurent's omap3isp/xclk branch on the 
Mike's clk-next (so it's based on 3.10-rc3).
