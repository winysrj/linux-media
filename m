For Kernel 4.5, the new ioctl is disabled. It was reverted after
pulling back from Linus tree, in order to allow the developers to
be able to test it and improve it if needed. So, the revert patch is
meant to reach upstream only in Kernel 4.6, as proposed in this patch.

It means that we have about 2 months to polite it before the next merge
window.

Well, the only doubt we had so far is about how to make it compatible
with 64 bits kernelspace and 32 bits userspace. 2 months seems more than
enough for us to properly address that.

Ok, that's the first time you come with that. I still think that those
could be addressed in the next 2 months, but, if not, we may eventually
postpone enabling G_TOPOLOGY ioctl further.

Laurent requested to postpone dynamic updates at the early stages of the MC
patchset review. The initial patchset were using krefs to handle it. We can
work on adding support for it for 4.6.

I'm actually working today to add MC support on em28xx USB hardware.
On such driver, there is a master driver (em28xx) and several sub-drivers
(em28xx-video, em28xx-dvb, em28xx-alsa and em28xx-input). The sub-drivers
are loaded asynchronously. meaning that the topology will be dynamically
updated during driver load. The alsa module (or snd-usb-audio - depending
on the hardware) can be unbind/rebind dynamically.

So, while the hardware itself is not dynamic, dynamic support is
needed, in order to avoid race conditions.

It can be simulated by removing/adding or binding/unbinding snd-usb-audio
module. We may also apply the virtual MC driver, if it is ready. Not
sure about its current review stage of the virtual driver.

A new ioctl to setup links is required, as we want to be able to change
the status of multiple links at once.

The thing with the PAD index is that it should be replaced by something
more generic, via the properties API. On some cases, just an index is
enough (when the pads are, for example, the output pins of a demux).

But, in general, what an application would want is to specify the
"audio out pin" or the "video out pin" of a device. As the index
number may vary depending on the specific device, Such application
should not have the index numbers hardcoded on it, but, instead, 
they should discover it via the userspace API. What we've agreed
is that such information would be coded as a property via the
properties API.

MEDIA_IOC_SETUP_LINK is a must only for subdev-centric hardware, like
OMAP3. For device-node-centric hardware (like em28xx, au0828, etc),
G_TOPOLOGY itself is useful to allow describing the hardware interfaces
and their connections, e. g. to reimplement libmedia_dev at v4l-utils
to use MC instead of sysfs.

Well, 2 months is enough for us to address the reserved fields ;)

See:
	https://linuxtv.org/downloads/v4l-dvb-apis/media-g-topology.html

Indeed, there is one missing struct there (media_v2_link). Not sure what
happened here. I guess I lost one hunk when I wrote the KernelDoc
patch. Anyway, adding it is easy. I'll prepare a patch for it soon.

The description of media_v2_topology actually matches our last
discussion (where we decided to not use any _reserved field there). 

Yet, this difference is actually the reason why we've delayed it in the
first place, as my guts tell that we need more discussions about it.

Making it depending on BROKEN at our development tree is not a good
thing, as BROKEN is not an option that can be changed with make
menuconfig/xconfig. It needs to be easy to do tests on our
development tree, in order for it to be tested by a broader audience.

Ok, if we end by needing to postpone it even further, we could do
something different, but it sounds to early to do that, as we can postpone
such decision to happen closer to the next merge window (or even to
happen just before releasing Kernel 4.6, if we discover too late some
real issue there).
