Hmm... last year, it was decided that we would be putting the DVB av7110-only
API files on a separate place, as the API there conflicts with V4L/alsa APIs
and are used only by one upstream driver (there were two drivers using them,
at that time). As you might notice, av7110 hardware is really old, not 
manufactured anymore since maybe 10 years ago, and it is an unmaintained
driver.

Some developers complained, arguing that moving it to a separate file would
be breaking the compilation on existing tools (they're basically concerned with
it due to out-of-tree drivers - mostly propietary ones, that use this API).

Now that we're moving everything, it does make sense to do that, moving 
dvb/(audio|osd|video).h to someplace else (maybe linux/dvb/av7110.h or
linux/dvb/legacy/*.h).

Regards,
Mauro
