I'm also interested in the status of the tm6010 driver (and getting it 
to work).

 From googling the net I can see that we are quite a few people who are 
frustrated with Hauppauge's change to the 900H model and dealers 
unknowingly shipping the 900H model as if it was the 900 model which 
isn't available anymore.

Mauro: Is there any way that we can help in developing the driver?

I hope it doesn't require a Windows environment (which I haven't). In 
any case I'm willing to test the driver in different environments 
(64bit, 32bit, Intel (Atom), AMD and VIA processors).

Thanks,

- Helge
