DT has been designed to represent a control-based view of the system. It does 
so pretty well using its tree-based model. However, it doesn't have a native 
way to represent a flow-based graph, hence the OF graph solution we're 
discussing. The whole point of this proposal is to represent the topology of 
the media device, not how each entity is controlled.
