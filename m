Yes, I realize I am in the dark ages.

I haven't been able to build a cost case for my normal home
communications needs to pay for Cable or Satellite internet service.  I
really dislike monthly recurring household costs for services that bill
me whether I use them or not, like communications.  I try to pay only
for plans that meet my common usage needs and no more.

My oldest child is to the point where she will need to start using the
internet for research for school next year.  I'll have to open my wallet
soon, as my household communications needs are growing.

You beat me to that joke.  Although I was going to say New Zealand...

I live in a very rural area:  No fiber optic, no DSL, EV-DO requires
directional antenna and amplifier.

Cable TV & internet is available, but is unreliable and expensive.
Satellite internet is available, of course.

Andy
