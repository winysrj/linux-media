I'm still somewhat confused by these properties. The "adi,sd-dac-enable"
property only describes two, the "sd" DACs, and "adi,dac-enable"
describes 6. From the block diagram in the device manual, there are only
6 DACs (1...6). None of the DACs seem to be limited in what they support
(unless that's described elsewhere), so I don't understand what the "sd"
DACs are. Could you elaborate?

Which DACs are being described by each property? They seem to overlap.

Why do we need to program them as on or off? Surely that depends on
whether or not they're connected to anything and whether or not we want
something to appear on that output? Can the "REFERENCE AND CABLE DETECT"
unit tell us that?

Until the binding is clarified and stabilised, I don't think the binding
or driver should be merged.

Thanks,
Mark.
