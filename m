I have no plans myself to discuss that during that conference. Someone else
may bring it up of course, but I have insufficient knowledge about it to
contribute much to such a discussion.

Nor do I think that that is something that needs to be discussed there. This
is something that can be discussed perfectly well here.

Basically things like this will not be fixed unless someone is willing to
put in the hours to find a good solution and to implement it (or cajole people
into doing it for you if you're not a programmer).

Regards,
