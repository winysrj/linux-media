Sorry for joining so late. Me and Tomasz Figa will be attending the ELC and
we would like to join the media mini summit.

There were many interesting topics suggested. I would like to discuss in
particular the "Per-frame settings aka configuration stores" suggested by
Hans.
 
Tomasz is working with the device tree so he could help us
with "Integration of the of-graph helpers and the component framework
(drivers/base/component.c) in V4L2", suggested by Laurent.

Best wishes,
