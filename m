Yes, this one gets fixed with the patch.

Seems to describe more than one bug.
What do mean with "when I plug em28xx device with analog support" ? Did
you mean "unplug" ?
Does this device use an external audio IC connected via i2c (e.g. EM202) ?
If yes, I think the patch should fix this issue, too.
Do you still have access to this device ? Can you test the patch ?

Frank
