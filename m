If the generic binding exists in both forms, most drivers should be
able to cope with both. Maybe it should be mentioned in the bindings
that the short form without ports node should be used where possible
(i.e. for devices that don't already have #address,size-cells != 1,0).

Having a separate wrapper to enforce the ports node for devices that
need it might be useful.

Sylwester suggested as an alternative, if I understood correctly, to
drop the endpoint node and instead keep the port:

    device-a {
        implicit_output_ep: port {
            remote-endpoint = <&explicit_input_ep>;
        };
    };

    device-b {
        port {
            explicit_input_ep: endpoint {
                remote-endpoint = <&implicit_output_ep>;
            };
        };
    };

This would have the advantage to reduce verbosity for devices with multiple
ports that are only connected via one endport each, and you'd always have
the connected ports in the device tree as 'port' nodes.

For the yes-ports-node version I see no problem, but without the ports node,
for_each_grandchild_of_node would also collect the children of non-port
child nodes.
The port and endpoint nodes in this binding are identified by their name,
so maybe adding of_get_next_child_by_name() /
for_each_named_child_of_node() could be helpful here.

The patches are merged into the staging tree now at bfe24b9.
