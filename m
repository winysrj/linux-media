I just subcribed to maillinglist to comment that there is probably some
misunderstanding about the Elgato EyeTV One: It is not a Mac-only product, it is
also on the market for Windows. In the Netherlands, Elgato EyeTV One is the only
product available for receiving TV Channels that are not free to air.

In the Netherlands, only the national public television channels Nederland 1,
Nederland 2, Nederland 3 and a regional public television channels are made
available free-to-air. DVB-T transmissions in the Netherlands are provided
commercially by KPN daughter company Digitenne. They offer 25 TV channels and 16
radio channels (which is growing). 

In order to receive the TV channels that are not free to air, a smartcard is
needed. IMHO, Elgato EyeTV One is the only product on the Dutch market that is
compatible with this smartcard.
