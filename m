It's been more than 2 months since the original email, it's less than 
two months away from the event, and one month away from what usually is 
the deadline for the booklet. File your talk now, while there are still 
some useful slots available.

Also, for those who have filed already but who have left their abstracts 
open, please get those filed in ASAP. Your talk will be only be ordered 
in when at least the basics are provided.

Thanks,

Luc Verhaegen.
