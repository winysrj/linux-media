Sorry, I meant V4L2_FIELD_INTERLACED support. Very few applications support
FIELD_TOP/BOTTOM, let alone SEQ_BT.

I don't get it. Getting your driver in staging is much better for you since
your code is in there and can be compiled for those who want to. I'm not
going to add your driver and then replace it with Ezequiel's version.

Heck, if you prefer your driver can be added to staging first, then Ezequiel's
driver commit can directly refer to the staging driver as being derived from it.

I'm not going to put both drivers in drivers/media. The functionalities of
these drivers should be merged. If I put both drivers in drivers/media then
that will never happen given human nature.
