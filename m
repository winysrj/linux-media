Yes the chip detects the signal automatically, What I want to configure in
the DT case is say if SOG signal is detected, I want to invert the polarity
of it this is what I am trying to set in DT case whether to invert or not.
0 = Normal operation (default)
1 = SOG output polarity inverted

Something similar to fid_polarity.
