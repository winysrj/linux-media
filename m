My idea is to just have a priority field for all devices which have
special requirements (i.e. beyond dma masks/alignement/segment limits).
Same priority on different devices would indicate an incompatibility, but
higher priority on a parent device would indicate a possible allocator.
That way you could have a root allocator if there's a way to unify
everything. Not sure though whether this will work, since on intel devices
we just don't have these kinds of special constraints.

Overall my idea is to reuse the existing dma allocation code in upstream
linux as much as possible. So having a completely separate hirarchy of
memory allocators for shared buffers should imo be avoided.
