Sorry, this has not been my intention. Still as far as I know, this is
the preferred method on LKML (adding as many CCs as one thinks people
could be or are involved into the problem in question.)

Cool, this would be a great start, really! I will switch to in-kernel
drivers again, too (thought 2.6.28.7 ones.) Let's see whether this
does work...

Well, the zone I'm living in was the first area where DVB-T has been
tested (somewhat around 1997 tests began IIRC.) Thus, we have a high
rate of DVB-T broadcasting stations here and you are basically happy
to watch DVB-T programmes nearly everywhere here.
Thus, I'd find having DVB-T working too would be AMAZING (I don't want
to pay cable fees either.)

But I cannot tune anything! ;-)
