So, there is no need for the i830 driver?  Can it just be removed
because i915 works instead?

So you are saying that just because distros will never build such a
thing, we should keep it building for SMP mode?  Why not prevent it from
being built and if a distro really cares, then they will pony up the
development to fix the driver up?

In other words, if someone really cares, then they will do the work,
otherwise why worry?  Especially as it seems that no one here is going
to do it, right?
