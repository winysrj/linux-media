The N900 front LED is quite a programmable beast [1], with a dedicated microcontroller (the lp5521) that runs little programs that define the blink patterns for the RGB LED.

And if you don't want to encapsulate all that in V4L2, it may be better to leave it to other APIs at some point of complexity (the current lp5521 driver seems to have a sysfs-only interface for now for the programmable patterns, and the standard LED API otherwise)

Well, that's exactly why duplicating API's is usually a bad idea. If the thing start to get complex, having only one place to hold
the mess is better than keeping it into two (or more) different places. This will become worst and worst. I mean, why do we want two
different APIs to control same stuff?

And yes, application developers must use the correct API to control stuff. Why should kernel duplicate interfaces just because
user land don't want to use two different interfaces? Doesn't this sound a bit ... strange at least?

OK, will search the logs. But you should probably add some sort of reasoning in your patch
description, explaining why you are duplicating interfaces.
