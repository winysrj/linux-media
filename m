Huh? I do not have lot of options here as far as error codes go. Invalid
request, invalid data in request - all goes to EINVAL.

OK, so I can change evdev to employ ENOIOCTLCMD where needed, bit that
will not change older kernels where such distinction is needed (as never
kernels do support newer ioctl). And even if I could go back it would
not help since userspace still sees EINVAL only.
