A few others that it sounds like A. may have been already planning on:

- Get the antenna out of the living room and give it some altitude -
height can really make a difference as far as signal attenuation goes.
(The freeware RadioMobile for Windows implements the Longley-Rice
Irregular Terrain Model for VHF/UHF propagation that creates pretty
pictures to show you the effects.)

- Get the antenna outside Celtex and other building materials can cause
a 3 db - 10 dB loss, and being behind shingles with water running down
them is just the worst it can get - short of being in a metal walled
structure....

Regards,
Andy
