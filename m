Oh wow I didn't know Hauppauge had released some new models above the 2200.
http://www.hauppauge.co.uk/site/products/prods_hvr_internal.html
Is this 4400 exactly the same as the HVR-2200, aside from the 
demodulator used for it's DVB-S/S2?
I hope so, that way work being done on the 2200 can flow onto this! 
(cept for DVB-S/S2)

Cheers,
Jed
