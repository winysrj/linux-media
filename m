Still struggling with my unknown card (see earlier mails), although I
have now got it to work somewhat more reliable based on input here on
the list, thanks!

So, to avoid a similar situation when building another Myth-TV box, I'm
now wondering which card to get.

I need analog input (PAL), but wouldn't mind DVB-T support either. As
such, the Hauppauge HVR-1300 would fit the bill nicely, but I'm
wondering if the MPEG encoder is really supported or not, and whether
this card can be brough to work relatively easily without any major
hassles? I just don't want to go through all sorts of trial and error
again to get it running stable.

If not, I guess the Hauppauge PVR-150 MCE appears to be a well supported
and stable workhorse?

Comments or recommendations much appreciated, thanks.
