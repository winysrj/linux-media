Subject: [PATCH 0/8] Fix gcc 4.6.0 set but not used warning messages.

First and foremost, I must
thank anybody taking the time to even
look at these(I know you people have better
things to be doing).

And secondly here is my try at trying
to fix some of the warning messages
spammed by gcc 4.6.0 when building the
kernel. Some of them I removed, and
some of them I just shut off.

Note: Removing the code does seem like a
good approach(if it's actually dead),
but if not then something needs
to be fixed.
As for shutting off the code to shutup gcc
does seem like a temporary fix, but would
rather have a warning message, than see it get
lost in the sands of time.

In any case Thanks for taking the time,
and hopefully we can get fixes for all of
this mess generated by gcc..
