Thanks, this was the missing piece of information to make sense of
 why it's bad for stack memory to be part of this.

I did mean s/dma api/usb_control_msg/ in the above paragraph. As that is the
 ''dma api'' these drivers are using... sorry for the confusion there...

ok.

thanks,

p.s.: hope this message get's through to the list... I am on the road
at the moment,
 so I'm not shure that there won't be any html in it again :(
