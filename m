* drivers/media/rc/img-ir/img-ir-hw.c
only seems to support one protocol at a time

* drivers/media/rc/rc-loopback.c
doesn't care

* drivers/media/rc/winbond-cir.c
seems hardware-wise very similar to nuvoton-cir.c, was not converted to
use the in-kernel encoders...has a private implementation

* drivers/media/rc/nuvoton-cir.c
is actually protocol agnostic but with your code it will encode
according to a randomly chosen protocol among the enabled ones, one that
will change depending on *module load order*...so unless I'm mistaken
you'll actually get different pulse/space timings written to hardware
depending on the order in which certain kernel modules have been
loaded...

Do you see why this is a bad idea?

Ehrm...I propose the patches be reverted until they're fixed.
