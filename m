David/Jarod,

I pushed the merged patches at the tmp_rc tree:

	http://git.linuxtv.org/mchehab/tmp_rc.git

Please test and give me some feedback. It ended that the rc function renaming patch
(6/7) broke both mceusb (due to TX changes) and cx231xx-input (a new driver from me,
for some devices that uses a crappy i2c uP, instead of the excellent in-cx231xx
IR support).

I did no tests at all, except for compilation. So, I need your feedback
if the patches didn't actually break anything.

I'll do some tests with cx231xx-input/mceusb probably later today.

Cheers,
Mauro.
