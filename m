 This is probably a bit OT, but these sorts of indicator LEDs can get quite complicated.

As part of our FCamera sample program on the Nokia N900 (which uses V4L2 way down there), we wanted to reprogram the front indicator LED to flash exactly when a picture is taken.  The N900 front LED is quite a programmable beast [1], with a dedicated microcontroller (the lp5521) that runs little programs that define the blink patterns for the RGB LED.

I'm not really suggesting that the V4L2 control should be able to handle this sort of an LED, but as these sorts of things get cheaper, it may become a case of 'why not?' for manufacturers putting in more complex RGB LEDs.   And if you don't want to encapsulate all that in V4L2, it may be better to leave it to other APIs at some point of complexity (the current lp5521 driver seems to have a sysfs-only interface for now for the programmable patterns, and the standard LED API otherwise)
