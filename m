We at Qualcomm have some platforms that have memory of different
performance characteristics, some drivers will need a way of
specifying that they need fast memory for an allocation (and would prefer
an error if it is not available rather than a fallback to slower
memory). It would also be bad if allocators who don't need fast
memory got it "accidentally", depriving those who really need it.

We also have platforms where a well-defined part of the memory
can be powered off, and other parts can't (or won't). We need a way
to steer the place allocations come from to the memory that won't be
turned off (so that CMA allocations are not an obstacle to memory
hotremove).
