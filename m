Hi Ya'll,

Going on response levels thus far I'm not expecting much :-D but I was 
wondering if someone could possibly help me out here.

Is there anything with half-decent driver support that is PCI/e, and has 
dual DVB-T + A/V-in?*
As a bonus it would be dual Hybrid and have hardware encode, but I 
wouldn't expect either to work at this stage.

I'm still trawling through mail-lists & wiki's etc, so I may yet find 
the best solution, but I was hoping some might already know.
Any advice or even just a response to chastise me is greatly 
appreciated!  :-D

Cheers,
Jed
*Is HVR-2200 the only option?
  I wish there was something with better AV-in but it might end-up being 
my final choice.
