Yeah, imon depends on rc-core, and requests its keymap via rc-core, so
rc-core should then load up rc-imon-pad. Just tried on 3.0-rc7+ here,
and everything is happy:

Just noticed your report is for 2.6.39.x and 2.6.38.x only, but I'm not
aware of any relevant imon changes between 2.6.39 and 3.0.

Looks like I'll probably have to give that a spin, since I'm not seeing
the problem here (I can also switch to an 0xffdc device, which is actually
handled a bit differently by the driver).
