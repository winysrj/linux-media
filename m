Yes, I have tested it. ;)
But it should be obvious that splitting messages doesn't work, because
the first byte of each message is treated as register address:

Let's say we want to transfer the 8 bytes 11 22 33 44 55 66 77 88 to
registers A0-A7 of a client.
The correspondig i2c message transferred via the i2c subsystem is A0 11
22 33 44 55 66 77 88
The current in em28xx splits this message into 3 messages:

message 1: A0 11 22 33
message 2: 44 55 66 77
message 3: 88

The result is, that only the first 3 bytes are transferred correctly.
The data bytes 44 and 88 are interpreted as register index and get lost,
data bytes 55 66 77 end up in registers 0x44, 0x45 and 0x46 instead of
0xA4 to 0xA6.
Ouch !

I2C adapters are supposed to fail with -EOPNOTSUPP if the message length
exceeds their capabilities.
Drivers must be able to handle this error, otherwise they have to be fixed.

While letting the i2c bus layer split messages sounds like the right
thing to do, it is hard to realize that in practice.
The reason is, that the needed algorithm depends on the capabilities and
behavior of the i2c adapter _and_ the connected i2c client.
The three main parameters are:
- message size limits
- client register width
- automatic register index incrementation

I don't know what has been discussed in past, but I talked to Jean
Delvare about the message size constraints a few weeks ago.
He told me that it doesn't make sense to try to handle this at the i2c
subsystem level. The parameters can be different for reading and
writing, adapter and client and things are getting complicated quickly.

Frank
