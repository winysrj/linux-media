/**
 * clk_get - lookup and obtain a reference to a clock producer.
 * @dev: device for clock "consumer"
 * @id: clock consumer ID
 *
 * Returns a struct clk corresponding to the clock producer, or
 * valid IS_ERR() condition containing errno.  The implementation
 * uses @dev and @id to determine the clock consumer, and thereby
 * the clock producer.  (IOW, @id may be identical strings, but
 * clk_get may return different clock producers depending on @dev.)
 *
 * Drivers must assume that the clock source is not enabled.
 *
 * clk_get should not be called from within interrupt context.
