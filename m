I'll change the default on Fedora (f16/f17/rawhide).

A simple way to solve it seems to make those options dependent on CONFIG_EXPERT.

Not sure if all usual distributions disable it, but I guess most won't have
EXPERT enabled.

The enclosed patch does that. If nobody complains, I'll submit it together
with the next git pull request.

[RFC PATCH] Make tuner/frontend options dependent on EXPERT

The media CUSTOMISE options are there to allow embedded systems and advanced
users to disable tuner/frontends that are supported by a bridge driver to
be disabled, in order to save some disk space and memory, when compiled builtin.

However, distros are mistakenly enabling it, causing problems when a
make oldconfig is used.

Make those options dependent on EXPERT, in order to avoid such annoyance behavior.
