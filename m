AFAIKT, this is not really needed, as the I2C clients are unregistered
when the I2C bus is unregistered.

So, a device disconnect will release it. Also, an em28xx driver unload.

The only difference might be if just ir-kbd-i2c and em28xx-rc are
unloaded, but em28xx is still loaded, but I think that, even on this
case, calling the .release code for an I2C bus will release it.

So, I don't see any need for such patch. I might be wrong, of course, but,
in order to proof that a release code is needed, you'll need to check if
some memory are lost after module load/unload.

A failure to initialize IR should not be fatal for the driver, as the
rest of the hardware still works.

Also, there's no way to warrant that the I2C code is actually running,
as ir-i2c-kbd may not even be compiled.

So, returning 0 there doesn't mean that IR is working.

I don't agree. It is better to keep RC maps for those devices together
with the RC protocol setting, get_key config, etc. At boards config,
it is very easy to identify I2C IR's, as there's an special field there
to mark those devices (has_ir_i2c). So, if the board has_ir_i2c, the
IR config is inside em28xx-input. That's the same logic that it is
there for has_dvb: if this field is true, the DVB specifics is inside
em28xx-dvb.

Ok. Separate patch, please.

Why? All boards with has_ir_i2c have entries there. I double-checked.
Adding will just bloat the code with no reason. We just need to take
care if we get a patch adding I2C IR support for an old card, to be
sure that data is filled on both places.

Considering that we don't receive any IR I2C code for several years,
and that newer devices won't use that part of the code, it seems highly
unlikely that such code would be ever used.

I disagree. The polling interval is mainly dictated by the RC protocol
used (e. g. the minimal time for a repeat code) and by the speed that 
users can type things. It is typically ~100 ms everywhere, except when
there are some exceptional cases, like GPIO polling.
