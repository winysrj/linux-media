Dear Guennadi

Thank you for checking

Yes. it is easier to use.
But, driver should judge whether to use this setting or not.
Because this setting is optional.

Because user setting might be 0,
we can not judge it like this.
  if (edge_xxx)
       ov772x_mask_set( xxxx )

So, we can use un-used bit to judge whether to use it.
and edge_strength and edge_threshold have un-used bit.
But edge_low and edge_high doesn't have un-used bit.

Another way to judge it is to use pointer or to add another variable.
But I don't like these style.
What do you think about this ?

Best regards
