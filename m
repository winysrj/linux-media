Thank you for the reviewing. I also think this version is clearer. :)
Base on the suggestion from you and J.C, I will send out the version 3 soon.

This dma_ctrl is hardware related memory layout. In the ISI_V1 hardware (AT91SAM9263, AVR32, etc), there is no dma_ctrl in the descriptor. In the future I prefer to add another ISI_V1 fbd structure and a function to handle these two structures according to hardware. But in this version I think ISI_V1 hardware platform is not supported.

It seems no problem if the initializing buffer numbers is the same as cleaning buffers numbers. For example, if we initialized 4 buffers for video buffer queue. It should be ok as long as we cleaned 4 buffers. No matter the order of the buffers to be cleaned up.

And yes, add a list to track the buffer descriptor is better way, I will change this. The list is look like following:
struct isi_dma_desc {
	struct list_head list;
	struct fbd *p_fbd;
	u32 fbd_phys;
};
The fbd_phys is physical address of the structure fbd.

Right. That is exact what I want to do.

Yes. I will do this way, if no platform_data provide, I will return an error directly.
