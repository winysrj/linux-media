If you need two receivers but can only spare up to one PCI or PCIe slot,
why not use two USB or FireWire attached receivers?

FireWire ones seem to be out of production now though and weren't
exactly on the cheap side.  OTOH one can drive up to 3 DVB FireWire
receivers on a single FireWire bus; and for those who need even more
there are dual link FireWire PCI and PCIe cards readily available.
