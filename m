Ah, so it's the name you have a problem with, not the flag as such. Hmm, 
you have a point, it can be improved upon. Luckily the spec describes 
the flag as: "A hint that this control is best represented as a 
slider-like element in a user interface." A dial is slider-like, so I'm 
OK with it :-)

But you are correct, the name is not right. I wish it was caught when I 
proposed this at the time.

         Hans
