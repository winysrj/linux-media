Unless we can find some way to resolve the problem which just happened
(Mauro applied the of-graph as patches to his tree inspite of this
discussion), I don't see the imx-drm DT changes being able to be pulled
in for the upcoming merge window - because otherwise it means that
whatever Mauro has applied your of-graph changes on top of in his tree
also gets pulled into my tree and Greg's tree.

I'm afraid this has turned into a total shambles, and I'm totally
hacked off at Mauro over this.
