It happens in solo_disp_init at uploading default motion thresholds
array.

I've got a prints trace with solo6010-fix-lockup branch
https://github.com/bluecherrydvr/linux/tree/solo6010-fix-lockup/drivers/media/pci/solo6x10
the trace itself in jpg:

Indeed, targeted fixing would be more reasonable than making register
r/w routines follow blocking fashion. But the driver is already complete
and was known to be working, and I seems all places in code assume the
blocking fashion of reg r/w, and changing that assumption may lead to
covert bugs anywhere else, not just at probing, which may be hard to
nail down.

For now, I'll try setting pci_read_config_word() back instead of full
revert. Does it need to be just in reg_write? No need for it in
reg_read, right?
