	While we are at it, what prevents VIDIOC_PREPARE_BUF calling
v4l_prepare_buf() -> (e.g) vb2_ioctl_prepare_buf() -> vb2_prepare_buf() ->
__buf_prepare() -> __qbuf_userptr() -> vb2_vmalloc_get_userptr() -> find_vma(),
AFAICS without having taken ->mmap_sem anywhere in process?  The code flow
is bloody convoluted and depends on a bunch of things done by initialization,
so I certainly might've missed something...
