Ok, I don't know if my approach is the "cleaner" version to support
bt656, but I will cleanup the code to be in a merge-able state and
send for review.

Something that I don't know if I got it right is configure the CCDC to
capture and odd numbers of lines (i.e: 625 lines from a PAL frame)
since the first and second sub-frames have different numbers of lines
(i.e: 313 and 312).

My solution was to reprogram the CCDC in the VD1 interrupt handler so
it can use the new configuration for the next sub-frame:

static void ispccdc_change_numlines(struct isp_device *isp, int numlines)
{
	isp_reg_writel(isp, ((numlines - 1) << ISPCCDC_VDINT_0_SHIFT) |
		       ((numlines * 2 / 3) << ISPCCDC_VDINT_1_SHIFT),
		       OMAP3_ISP_IOMEM_CCDC, ISPCCDC_VDINT);
	isp_reg_writel(isp, (numlines - 1)
		       << ISPCCDC_VERT_LINES_NLV_SHIFT,
		       OMAP3_ISP_IOMEM_CCDC, ISPCCDC_VERT_LINES);
}

Is this the right approach? because I didn't find in the TRM how to
configure the CCDC to generate the VD0 and VD1 interrupts with
variable frame vertical length.

Ok, I will. Thank you very much for your comments.
