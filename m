No, this will not work - this API has to be used from board code and 
videobuf can be built modular.

We have currently a number of boards broken in the mainline. They must be 
fixed for 2.6.36. I don't think the mentioned API will do this for us. So, 
as I suggested earlier, we need either this or my patch series

http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.linux.ports.sh.devel/8595

for 2.6.36.
