Not for version 1, but it would be a useful addition once we start
using this mechanism.

I will rephrase it as suggested by Rob as well.

Rob has very eloquently and kindly explained it in his reply.

I looked into scripts/kernel-doc, and
Documentation/kernel-doc-na-HOWTO.txt => both these places mention
that the kernel-doc comments have to start with /**, and I couldn't
spot an error in what's wrong with my usage - would you please
elaborate on what you think is not right?

ok.

:) well, in context of dma-buf 'exporter', it makes sense.

I could do that, but then anyways I will have to do a
forward-declaration of dma_buf_attachment, since I have to use it in
dma_buf_ops. If it improves readability, I am happy to move it below
struct dma_buf.

This and above comment on 'register' are already answered by Rob in
his explanation of the sequence in earlier reply. [the Documentation
patch [2/2] also tries to explain it]

ok, sure. it is meant for the attach op.

That's a nice suggestion; I will add it to the wrapper function for
map_dma_buf().

Will document it to return -EINVAL if atleast on attach() hasn't been called.

Oops; removed in v3 - will correct.

Requirement is to allow for blocking and non-blocking versions of
map_dma_buf. try_map_dma_buf could be used for the non-blocking
version.

My bad - it is meant for the exporter - exporter gives this as one of
the parameters to 'dma_buf_export()' API. I will correct the comment.

Thanks for your review!
