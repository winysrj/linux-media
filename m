Hello Guys

What is the tool of choice to use to scan dvbs2 satellites ? I tried
dvbscan but it only picked up dvbs transponders , the dvbs2 ones it
failed to tune . I saw that there used to be this utility scan-s2 ,
but looks like it was abandoned a couple of years ago and has not been
maintained since . So how do you guys do a transponder scan for dvbs2
?

Best Regards
Milorad
