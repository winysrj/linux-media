I also don't see a problem in discussing it a bit more;)

Yes, I meant the in kernel design, i.e. generic face detection kernel module
and an OMAP4 FDIF driver. It makes lots of sense to separate common code
in this way, maybe even when there would be only OMAP devices using it.

I'm sure now the Samsung devices won't fit in video output node based driver
design. They read image data in different ways and also the FD result format
is totally different.

Sorry, I cannot provide much details at the moment, but there exists hardware
that reads data from internal SoC buses and even if it uses some sort of
cache memory it doesn't necessarily have to be available for the user.

Still the FD result is associated with an image frame for such H/W, but not
necessarily with a memory buffer queued by a user application.

How long it approximately takes to process single image for OMAP4 FDIF ?

I think you misunderstood me. I wasn't talking about core/driver module split,
I meant we should not be making the user interface video node centric.

I think for Samsung devices I'll need a capture video node for passing
the result to the user. So instead of associating FD result with a buffer index
we could try to use the frame sequence number (struct v4l2_buffer.sequence,
http://linuxtv.org/downloads/v4l-dvb-apis/buffer.html#v4l2-buffer).

It might be much better as the v4l2 events are associated with the frame
sequence. And if we use controls then you get control events for free,
and each event carries a frame sequence number int it
(http://linuxtv.org/downloads/v4l-dvb-apis/vidioc-dqevent.html).
