Turns out, the chip REALLY REALLY is 0x5a. I took some snapshots of both 
the tuner and bridge/demodulator and uploaded them to the linuxtv wiki 
[1]. If you could compare that one to your Chips? The markings are:

FCI 2580 01BD

AF9035B-N2
1012 QJFSQ


On a more serious note, right now, the driver soft-locks-up. Either with 
or without accepting the 0x5a chip_id.

What I do is, manually load all modules, enable debugging and plug in 
the device.

Everything appears to work normally for a while, I can do the dmesg dump 
etc, but after about 22 seconds, I get this warning:
BUG: soft lockup - CPU#2 stuck for 22s! [udev-acl:2320]
(With the CPU# number being arbitrary). 22s later, another CPU fails. I 
haven't waited for the other core's to fail.

Also, removing the module is impossible. Rebooting also fails. I have to 
sys-req reboot it.

I don't know how much my patch is responsible for this of course, but 
since attaching of the tuner fails due to the wrong chip_id in one case, 
the only code affected is the USB id that loads the driver/firmware. I 
did see this with the older firmware too btw, so appears to be firmware 
unrelated.

In the meantime, I continue finding out why after accepting chip_id 
0x5a, it still fails on tuner attach. I suppose somehow the tuner_id 
isn't matching, which is weird, but will find out about it in the next 
few days.
