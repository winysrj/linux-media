This is not a valid solution.  Notice that your _hcd_buffer_free still 
dereferences hcd->driver; that will not point to anything useful if you 
rmmod the HCD.

Also, you neglected to move the calls to hcd_buffer_destroy from 
usb_remove_hcd to hcd_release.

On the whole, it would be easier if the UVC driver could release its 
coherent DMA buffers during the disconnect callback.  If that's not 
feasible we'll have to find some other solution.
