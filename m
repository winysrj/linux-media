So the idea is to grab a large chunk of memory at boot time and then
later allow some device to use it?

I'd much rather we'd improve the regular page allocator to be smarter
about this. We recently added a lot of smarts to it like memory
compaction, which allows large gobs of contiguous memory to be freed for
things like huge pages.

If you want guarantees you can free stuff, why not add constraints to
the page allocation type and only allow MIGRATE_MOVABLE pages inside a
certain region, those pages are easily freed/moved aside to satisfy
large contiguous allocations.

Also, please remove --chain-reply-to from your git config. You're using
1.7 which should do the right thing (--no-chain-reply-to) by default.
