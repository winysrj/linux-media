Nicholas has provided a very good list of constructive ways that
non-developers can improve support for devices.  Here are a few other
ways people can help out:

Improve the wiki:  help out CityK with the linux-dvb/v4l unification
and make sure the information is correct.

Lurk on #linux-dvb and #v4l, and help out less experienced users.  New
users often jump onto those two lists asking for help getting their
devices up and running.  In many cases, their device is supported but
they're just having trouble installing the latest v4l-dvb code or
using tools such as scan, zap, Kaffeine, tvtime, VDR, etc.  Help those
users work through their issues.  If the device doesn't work, walk
them through collecting the necessary debug info required to report
the problem on the mailing list.

Not only are these things helpful to other users - it allows the
developers can focus on adding driver support rather than spending
that time helping out new users...
