Good day dear, i hope this letter meets you well? my name is Jack, I know this may seem inappropriate so i ask for your forgiveness, i wish to get to know you better, if I may be so bold. I consider myself an easy-going man, adventurous, honest and fun loving person but I am currently looking for a relationship in which I will feel loved. I promise to answer any question that you may want to ask me...all i need is just your attention and the chance to know you more.
Please tell me more about yourself, if you do not mind. Hope to hear back from you soon and i hope this letter will be the beginning of a lasting communication between us.

Jack.
