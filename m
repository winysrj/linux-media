Ok, I will remove it from the TODO list. Core memory management is very 
little dependence on HIGHMEM, it is more about DMA-mapping framework to 
be aware that there might be no lowmem mappings for the allocated pages.
This can be easily added once the initial version got merged.

Since v18 the failed allocation is retried in a bit different place in 
the contiguous memory area what heavily increased overall reliability.

This can be improved by making cma a bit more aware about pending io 
operations, but I want to leave this after the initial merge.

I think that there are no major issues left to be resolved now.
