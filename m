Hi Guennadi,

Thanks for you comments...

>>>Hi Alex

>>>Why is the cc-list mangled again? Why is the V4L list dropped again?
>>>What's so difficult about hitting the "reply-to-all" button?

 You are absolutely right, I hope that now the cc-list valid.

>>>First of all it shows, that you're not using the newest kernel:

>>>http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.linux.ports.sh.devel/11508

I use Linux version 3.3.0-rc6 it contains the changes.

>>>Secondly, as Fabio just pointed out, these messages are not fatal, which

Ok

>>>Please, describe the actual problem, that you're getting (if any) and do

At this stage, for me the problem of this type are actual, for the simple reason that I see it the first time.
Thanks for support and patience :-)
