Agreed!

I would like to add some pointers on making the Avermedia Volar X DVB-T 
device work to the wiki, but I'm not sure if this 'supported or unsupported?
Case:
Avermedia Volar X DVB-T with AF9015-NT* & MXL5003S
Works with compiling the source from:
http://linuxtv.org/hg/~anttip/af9015/
and firmware from:
http://www.otit.fi/~crope/v4l-dvb/af9015/af9015_firmware_cutter/firmware_files/

Is it ok if I add it as a minor edit to:

http://www.linuxtv.org/wiki/index.php/DVB-T_USB_Devices#Afatech_AF9013_and_AF9015
?

Regards,

Jos Hoekstra
