Ok, sounds good.

Yes, that is the idea. Maybe we should add it to the list things that the
Linaro kernel working group can target for the November release?

The dma-mapping API can deal well with one IOMMU per device, but would
need some tricks to work with one device that has two separate IOMMUs.

I'm not very familar with the iommu API, but in the common KVM scenario,
you need one IOMMU per device, so it should handle that just fine as well.

You mean mapping the same memory into multiple devices, or a different problem?
