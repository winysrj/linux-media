I'm currently running two of these cards in the same box with this
patch.
Actually, later on I've even set curlim = SEC_CURRENT_LIM_OFF because
sometimes diseqc wasn't working fine and that seemed to solve the
problem.

I used to have skystar2 cards before and I did not run into those
issues. Diseqc just worked fine.

For reference each tt s2 is plugged to a diseqc switch with 4 output,
each output connected to a quad lnb.

Is there another way to solve this ?
Maybe add a module parameter for people who want to override the
default ?
