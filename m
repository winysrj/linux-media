Greetings ...

 Sorry if this has come through before, but I did not recieve a copy
or a reply, so I'm assuming the orginal message did not get through
... Or I'm been ignored ... ;-)

 I was wondering if anybody has looked at the Syntek Driver stk11xx at
http://sourceforge.net/projects/syntekdriver/files/ ...

This driver is meant to have updates for the EasyCap USB video capture
device ...

Hans de Goede suggested I post here ... As was explained, I'm not a
kernel programmer, but I do own one of these devices, so I can test,
maybe compile code and maybe help debug stuff, but I don't have the
skill to do much more than that ...

Would be great to have included in the main line Video4Linux and then
up stream Kernel ... Pretty please!!

Thanks
