Do you have a reliable, working usbip solution at hand that work on Windows and Linux and doesn't require real network access, which can be a no-go for some scenarios?

There are drivers for xhci adapters on Windows. Also, this whole discussion is pretty much future oriented - which most likely means built-in xhci drivers anywhere.

No, in all seriousity, the main reason to go for FV vs PV is that so far, the best tested and working drivers are built for real hardware. I'm still unsatisfied with the PV driver situation for virtio on Windows. It's just incredibly hard to get Windows drivers right - and open source developers sure are not good at it :)

But sure, let's talk about it during LinuxCon as well - there's a good chance you know more there than me :)
