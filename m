Hi Carlos,
thanks for your response.

I've read your message on permalink.

I'm not sure the ISP is broken, or at least it may be broken but it can
be fixed.

I'm trying to work the tvp5151 board described in [1], the author
states (and told me) that it was successfull in using that board, using
a patch that he also publish, but my board is not working (using the
same patch set). Maybe there is something different in my kernel, even
if the version is the same? 

I'm going to try applying the patch by hand, to check if there is
something different respect the source that the patch is made from.

It will be useful to me to have a kernel (with modules) that works with
that board, this way I could check if the problem is in the hw or in
the sw.

I'll continue to try.

Regards
Francesco
