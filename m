Some questions, I've started playing around with using this framework
to do buffer sharing between DRM devices,

Why struct scatterlist and not struct sg_table? it seems like I really
want to use an sg_table,

I'm not convinced fd's are really useful over just some idr allocated
handle, so far I'm just returning the "fd" to userspace as a handle,
and passing it back in the other side, so I'm not really sure what an
fd wins us here, apart from the mmap thing which I think shouldn't be
here anyways.
(if fd's do win us more we should probably record that in the docs patch).

Dave.
