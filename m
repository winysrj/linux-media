Ok, I understand. I will write something like this.

I understand

yeah I know :)

So the MODULE_AUTHOR will be Windriver forever until they drop authorship? 
Also if in the next future 0 windriver lines will be in the code?

(general talking, not about this driver)
If I do git blame on a driver with MODULE_AUTHOR("Mr. X"); but only the 
MODULE_AUTHOR line is from Mr X; there is not an automatically system which 
remove the MODULE_AUTHOR? Ok, probably it was the original author of the code 
and the comment header with the copyright history gives to Mr X all the 
honours, but there is nothing from him in the code. It is not better to remove 
MODULE_AUTHOR or replace it with who wrotes most of the code?
I know that this is not the best place to talk about this, just a little 
curiosity
