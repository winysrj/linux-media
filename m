Are you sure you want this to be a bool?  This thing is trying to shadow the "enable" parameter of the s_stream() callback, and that enable parameter is int.

I think I do need that local variable, the way the code is arranged now.  I'm trying to save the state of enablement inside of priv->current_enable, at the time we are suspending, so it won't necessarily be true.  And one of the side effects of calling ov9740_s_stream(sd, 0) is that priv->current_enable will be set to false, which is why I save off the value of priv->current_enable, and then restore it after the call to ov9740_s_stream().

Okay, will do.  Thanks for pointing that out :)

Is the camera host driver expected to directly call the sensor driver's s_power (via v4l2_subdev_call(sd, core, s_power, <some value>)?  Or does the v4l2 framework do this for you?  I didn't see an example of this in my last pull of linux-next.
