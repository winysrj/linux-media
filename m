It is really not a big issue to increase it by a few MBytes.

We can get back into this once a driver which really benefits from comes.

Sorry, but I won't accept such driver/allocator which abuses the defined API. I've already
pointed what vaddr method is used for.

I gave the example. Your allocator should have something similar.
