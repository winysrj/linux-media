Hi All,

i was reading with intrest thet there was a decission made to
get DVB S2 support into the mainline kernel. What makes me unhappy
from a user point of view is, how people on this list are acting.
The only thing i can see is digging in history, but no solution.
Do not waste time to search what happend, take your time to bring
things together. User don't care about the tecnical decission if
S2API or Multiproto, they only wanna see working drivers. It is
not in the sense of the userbase to whimm around why the decission
was made. Please cool down and bring the pieces together to give the
user the widest driver base and support for S2API.

cu

Edgar (gimli) Hucek
