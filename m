I would like to add more in relation to  CPU access :

a) we could have CPU-accessible part of VRAM ("inside" of PCIe BAR register)
and non-CPU  accessible part.  As the result if user needs to have
CPU access than memory should be located in CPU-accessible part
of VRAM or in system memory.

Application/user mode driver could specify preference/hints of
locations based on their assumption / knowledge about access
patterns requirements, game resolution,  knowledge
about size of VRAM memory, etc.  So if CPU access performance
is critical then such memory should be allocated in system memory
as  the first (and may be only) choice.

b) Allocation may not  have CPU address  at all - only GPU one.
Also we may not be able to have CPU address/accesses for all VRAM
memory but memory may still  be migrated in any case unrelated
if we have CPU address or not.

c) " VRAM, it becomes non-cachable "
Strictly speaking VRAM is configured as WC (write-combined memory) to
provide fast CPU write access. Also it was found that sometimes if CPU
access is not critical from performance perspective it may be useful
to allocate/program system memory also as WC to  avoid needs for
extra "snooping" to synchronize with CPU caches during GPU access.
So potentially system memory could be WC too.
