lsusb mentions 4 different end points, all isochronous. So out of luck
there. I did not know I could use lsusb to find this out.

Well, I was hoping to get "force_bulk", so that part is not a problem
for me.

It is a general issue with the Raspberry USB host controller or driver.
Bulk transfers work, isochronous transfers have problems. I was hoping I
could somehow convince the Nanostick to use bulk transfers instead of
isochronous transfers. Since that seems to require a firmware change, I
will have to give up on it.
