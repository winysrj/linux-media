Hello Robin,

Do you know of any such devices that claim to work like that even
under Windows?  Generally, all the digital cameras I see that can
capture video can't do it while the device is plugged in to the PC.
If you can provide some specific examples of models that do this under
Windows, we can possibly look at what would be required to make them
work under Linux.

Cheers,

Devin
