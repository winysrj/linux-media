Subject: [PATCH v4 0/9] Renesas Capture Engine Unit (CEU) V4L2 driver
Date: Tue,  9 Jan 2018 17:25:22 +0100

Hello,
   fourth round for Renesas CEU unit.

The only notable change compared to v3 is that we have dropped the generic
fallback compatible string "renesas,ceu" from bindings and CEU driver.

Apart from that a few minor changes in driver code as reported by Laurent and
below listed.

Most of the patches now have the Reviewed-by tag, so I hope we're very close
to merge this.

Thanks
   j

v3->v4:
- Drop generic fallback compatible string "renesas,ceu"
- Addressed Laurent's comments on [3/9]
  - Fix error messages on irq get/request
  - Do not leak ceudev if irq_get fails
  - Make irq_mask a const field

v2->v3:
- Improved DT bindings removing standard properties (pinctrl- ones and
  remote-endpoint) not specific to this driver and improved description of
  compatible strings
- Remove ov772x's xlkc_rate property and set clock rate in Migo-R board file
- Made 'xclk' clock private to ov772x driver in Migo-R board file
- Change 'rstb' GPIO active output level and changed ov772x and tw9910 drivers
  accordingly as suggested by Fabio
- Minor changes in CEU driver to address Laurent's comments
- Moved Migo-R setup patch to the end of the series to silence 0-day bot
- Renamed tw9910 clock to 'xti' as per video decoder manual
- Changed all SPDX identifiers to GPL-2.0 from previous GPL-2.0+

v1->v2:
 - DT
 -- Addressed Geert's comments and added clocks for CEU to mstp6 clock source
 -- Specified supported generic video iterfaces properties in dt-bindings and
    simplified example

 - CEU driver
 -- Re-worked interrupt handler, interrupt management, reset(*) and capture
    start operation
 -- Re-worked querycap/enum_input/enum_frameintervals to fix some
    v4l2_compliance failures
 -- Removed soc_camera legacy operations g/s_mbus_format
 -- Update to new notifier implementation
 -- Fixed several comments from Hans, Laurent and Sakari

 - Migo-R
 -- Register clocks and gpios for sensor drivers in Migo-R setup
 -- Updated sensors (tw9910 and ov772x) drivers headers and drivers to close
    remarks from Hans and Laurent:
 --- Removed platform callbacks and handle clocks and gpios from sensor drivers
 --- Remove g/s_mbus_config operations
