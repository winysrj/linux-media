Hello,

I don't know how to get access to the v4l controls on a I2C camera sensor.

My driver structure looks following:

bridge driver                            -> csi-driver                                  -> sensor driver (includes controls)
register-async-notifer for csi driver        register-async-notifer for sensor driver
register video device

The v4l2 API say:
When a sub-device is registered with a V4L2 driver by calling v4l2_device_register_subdev() and the ctrl_handler fields of both v4l2_subdev and v4l2_device are set, then the controls of the subdev will become automatically available in the V4L2 driver as well. If the subdev driver contains controls that already exist in the V4L2 driver, then those will be skipped (so a V4L2 driver can always override a subdev control).

But how can I get access to the controls by asynchronous registration, because the controls are not added to the video device automatically?

Normally I can use:

v4l2-ctl -l -d /dev/video0

I don't know if this forum is the right place for this question, so please answer with a private e-mail su@mycable.de
