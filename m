Hi Devin,
your numbers say something but not everything if you don't compare the date
of the user's subscription. I am new to the forum for about 2 months and
when I was able to help or offer something I did it. Especially for some
questions about some chipsets I could have interesting answers when
neccessary. But I will not spent more time to delete several e-mails about
analog, webcams etc. where I have no knowledge or interest.

It's possible that it will be better in average, who knows, but not in all
cases. The remaining time when linux-dvb is alive I am there. I wish you
easier work with linux-media. But without me.

Have a nice day,
Tomas
