The adv7343 decoder, fits on da850/dm6467 etc.. For the da850 it supports
only SD where as the dm6467 supports HD/SD/ED for which DAC 1-6 of
Register 0x0 varies for this board so I added them as the platform data
but I got a review comment in the ML asking to add entire register as
the pdata instead of DAC 1-6, so because of which it is being converted
in the same way for DT.
