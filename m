Ah, interesting. So there is no tlb flush broadcast operation and it
always goes through IPI?

Ok. Can we limit GFP_ATOMIC to memory that doesn't need to be remapped then?
I guess we can assume that there is no regression if we just skip
the dma_alloc_contiguous step in dma_alloc_coherent for any atomic
callers and immediately fall back to the regular allocator.

Unfortunately, this still means we have to keep both methods. I was
hoping that with CMA doing dynamic remapping there would be no need for
keeping a significant number of pages reserved for this.
