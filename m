Thanks for the explanation. It would be great if you could update your 
board/beagle/mt9p031 branch and include the discussed changes. I belive 
your branch is the only authoritative source of magic required to get 
the Aptina+Beagle combination going.

Not a problem at all. The confusion was worse when I was trying to apply 
random patch files found via Google. ;)
