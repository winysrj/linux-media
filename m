I do not dispute the usefulness of the "linux,rc-map-name" property
in general, e.g. for boards that support a single remote control.

I am arguing that the person writing the device tree has no way of
knowing which rc-map a given user will be using, because it depends
on the actual remote control being used.

Maybe I'm missing something.

Regards.
