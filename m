Hi,

I've been testing the TT S2-3200 card and while it performs well for FTA
services I have been unable to get it working with encrypted services using
the CI slot.

With VLC I am able to tune to the transponder and pick up all the services
but they are not decrypted, unencrypted services work fine.

Using a DVB-S card with CI I am able to tune successfully, proving the CAMs
are valid. This leads me to believe there may be a problem with the drivers
for the S2-3200.

Has anyone managed to get CAMs working with this card?

Any advice gratefully recieved.

Many thanks,

Lou
