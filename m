Well, if someone pops up with a problem with Gst 1.2 + libv4l 1.2
(with seems unlikely, as you pointed below), then we can provide them
some directions to either:
	1) revert the libv4l2 DQBUF patch;
	2) upgrade to gst 1.4;
	3) don't revert the POLLERR patch, if VBI is not needed on such
specific scenario.

Well, we can't do much with vendor-specific versions, especially
when they rely on too old Kernels and/or too old Gstreamer versions.

Anyway, I guess that the POLLERR patch were not backported to -stable.
So, vendor-specific versions with old stacks won't be affected, as
the POLLERR fixup was added on Kernel 3.16.

I suspect that there aren't many places where a vendor distro
using Gst 0.10 has Kernel 3.16.

Yes, I agree.
