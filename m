Well, before this change, it was a full miss scenario, as it will 
never lock on low symbol rate channels.

Ok, so latter patches need to improve the algorithm to improve it
for lower symbol rates. By getting feedback about this patch, we'll
know more about how bad is the current algorithm, as people may now
report and work on improve it.

If that happens, that would be a firmware or hardware issue.
As I said before, ST can provide us an answer if the hardware has
such bug.

Ok, so let's wait for ST to provide us some feedback on this public
thread, in order to be sure that we need to reverse it because of
some hardware bug, or to get an improved algorithm that will better 
work with low symbol rates.
