My understanding has been that the link data would be used determine
when the controller driver can be brought up and active. Certainly both
sides of a link need to be 'live' before the link can be used. The
kernel must have a way to resolve the question of "who starts first?",
whether it be the situation of the consumer starts before the producer,
or the situation of two components need to start before the controller
driver can start. That is the dependency chain I'm talking about.

right.

I'm firm on the opinion that the checking must also happen at runtime.
The biggest part of my objection has been how easy it would be to get a
linkage out of sync, and dtc is not necessarily the last tool to touch
the dtb before the kernel gets booted. I want the kernel to flat out
reject any linkage that is improperly formed.
