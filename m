Yeah.  A couple weeks is probably too long.  But I think a week is
totally reasonable.

You have the process wrong.  The maintainer reviews it first, merges
it into his -next git tree.  It sits in linux-next for a bit.  The
merge window opens up.  It is merged.  It gets tested for 3 months.
It is released.

It should work as a continuous even flow.  It shouldn't be a rush to
submit drivers right before the merge window opens.  It's not hard,
you can submit a driver to linux-next at any time.  It magically
flows through the process and is released some months later.

It does suck to add a 3 month delay for people who miss the cut off.
Don't wait until the last minute.  In the embedded world you can
use git cherry-pick to get the driver from linux-next.
