I already regret to having added that last "critical section" remark.
Think barriers. It's just that you need a barrier in both directions that
bracket the actual usage. In i915-land we call the first one generally
invalidate (so that caches on the target domain don't contain stale data)
and that second one flush (to get any data out of caches).

I agree with your points here, afaics the contentious issue is just
whether dma_buf should _enforce_ this strict ordering. I'm leading towards
a "no" for the following reasons:

- gpu people love nonblocking interfaces (and love to come up with
  abuses). In the generic case we'd need some more functions to properly
  flush everything while 2 devices access a buffer concurrently (which is
  imo a bit unrealistic). But e.g. 2 gpus rendering in SLI mode very much
  want to access the same buffer at the same time (and the
  kernel+userspace gpu driver already needs all the information about
  caches to make that happen, at least on x86).

- Buffer sharing alone has already some great potential for deadlock and
  lock recursion issues. Making dma_buf into something that very much acts
  like a new locking primitive itself (even exposed to userspace) will
  make this much worse. I've seen some of the kernel/userspace shared
  hwlock code of dri1 yonder, and it's horrible (and at least for the case
  of the dri1 hwlock, totally broken).

- All current subsystem already have the concept to pass the ownership of
  a buffer between the device and userspace (sometimes even more than just
  2 domains, like in i915 ...). Userspace already needs to use this
  interface to get anything resembling correct data. I don't see any case
  where userspace can't enforce passing around buffer ownership if
  multiple devices are involved (we obviously need to clarify subsystem
  interfaces to make it clear when a buffer is in use and when another
  device taking part in the sharing could use it). So I don't see how the
  kernel enforcing strict access ordering helps implementing correct
  userspace.

- I don't see any security needs that would make it necessary for the
  kernel to enforce any consistency guarantees for concurrent access -
  we're only dealing with pixel data in all the currently discussed
  generic use-cases. So I think garbage as an end-result is acceptable if
  userspace does stupid things (or fails at trying to be clever).

Cheers, Daniel
