Couple of weeks in linux-next plus a couple of weeks of final patch
series version awaiting to being reviewed and picked up by a maintainer
makes almost entire kernel development cycle. These are huge additional
delays, especially in the embedded world. Things like these certainly
aren't encouraging for moving over from out-of-tree to the mainline
development process. And in this case we are talking only about merging
driver to the staging tree...
