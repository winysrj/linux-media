---

The Planning Committee for the Linux Plumbers Conference (LPC) is happy
to announce that submissions to the "micro-conferences" portion of the
conference is now open.  The micro-conferences are working session
focused on specific infrastructural "plumbing" in the Linux system --
kernel subsystems, core libraries, windowing system, etc. -- which are
half-day in length.

The potential topics for the working sessions can be found at the Topics
page[1] of the LPC wiki and include:

	* Power Management
	* Virtualization
	* Mono
	* Desktop
	* Tracing
	* Real-time response for full FOSS/Linux stack
	* User-visible Problems in Networking
	* Media Infrastructure
	* Audio
	* HA Clustering
	* Legal Hygiene
	* Embedded Topics
	* Boot/init

[1] http://wiki.linuxplumbersconf.org/2010:topics

The topics that will actually have working sessions scheduled at the LPC
will depend on the submissions to the microconference and on the ability
of its respective community to organize a successful working session;
see "Responsibility of a working session leader"[2] page on the LPC
wiki for more details.

Microconference submissions do not have to reflect finished work.  In
fact, proposals or proof-of-concepts of potential solutions to important
problems are encouraged, so they can be discussed and debated during the
microconference.  Proposals for presentations at a microconference may
be submitted here [3]:

In addition to the micro conference, the Linux Plumbers Conference has
open calls for papers[4] and BOF's[5].
