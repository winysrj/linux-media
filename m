	Hello,

The following patch broke our userspace software builds. While it does 
preserve BINARY compatibility, it breaks SOURCE compatibility as the parameter 
names have changed. I don't see the rationale for breaking compatibility in 
the patch description.

Please consider reverting to the old names. Thank you.

    [media] dvb_frontend: add multistream support
    
    Unify multistream support at the DVBAPI: several delivery systems
    allow it. Yet, each one had its own name. So, instead of adding
    a third version of this field, remove the per-standard naming,
    unifying it into a common name.
    
    The legacy code number can still be used by old applications.
    
    Version increased to 5.8.
    
    [mchehab@redhat.com: joined the va1j5jf007s patch, in order to
     avoid compilation breakage]
