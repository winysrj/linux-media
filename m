Well I've reworked the code to use shared_max, so this point is moot. :-)

On any archs I'm aware of it would work, either the old or new value would be visible, as long as natural alignment is used.
rcu uses the same trick in the rcu_dereference macro, so if this didn't work rcu wouldn't work either.
