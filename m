Hi,

I've registered to linux-media mailing list a couple of days ago and 
attempted to do my first posting yesterday with subject "Support for 
Magicpro proHDTV Dual DMB-TH adapter". However I can't see my posting 
even though I've replied to the email requesting confirmation.

Would you please kindly have a look!

Thanks,
K.S. Ng
