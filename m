this is really very good progress now, given that previously on such OEM
and special devices testing abilities have been restricted for almost
all of us. Nevertheless, they are in substantial numbers in the markets.

What makes me still wonder a little, since I can't test almost nothing
on the second 0008 subdevice, how to deal with the RF loopthrough, this
I can test and is active in both directions for what I can say.

Cheers,
Hermann
