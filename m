Doing a buffer sharing with something that is not GPL is not fun, as, if any
issue rises there, it would be impossible to discover if the problem is either
at the closed-source driver or at the open source one. At the time I was using
the Nvidia proprietary driver, it was very common to have unexplained issues
caused likely by bad code there at the buffer management code, causing X
applications and extensions (like xv) to break.

We should really make this EXPORT_SYMBOL_GPL(), in order to be able to latter
debug future share buffer issues, when needed.
