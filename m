Hello,

I am new on this list and I would like to help with my support. I know
rather well the Philips/NXP channel demodulators/decoders (TDA10023/24,
TDA10046/A, TDA10048) as I've had to support them for a while.

I am starting first in diving into the tda10048 driver (DVB-T) to become
familiar with the API. In case you know some existing issues, please
report them to me, I would be glad to investigate and help.

Last but not least, I don't have any hardware yet, is it blocking to
eventually send patches ?

Thanks.
Regards.
