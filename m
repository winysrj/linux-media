Hello all
This is an old card i bough by error ( wanted the DVB-T version ) but i 
tried it and i see a small problem :
The remote isn't supported. ( If it is, i wonder why my computer don't 
see it )

I found an old patch to add remote support to it here :

http://tfpsly.free.fr/Files/Instant_TV_PCI_remote/saa7134_patch_for_AdsInstantTVPCI.gz
( The webpage talking about it is 
http://tfpsly.free.fr/francais/index.html?url=http://tfpsly.free.fr/Files/Instant_TV_PCI_remote/index.html 
in french )

But since i found out long ago that i shouldn't even think of altering a 
source file, could someone adapt that old patch to correct this ? ( 
should be quick, i guess )

Thanks.
