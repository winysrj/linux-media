While looking on what happened in the past would help us to improve
future patch submissions, it won't solve the issues we're now facing,
as we cannot go back in time and fix it.

We need to move on, and the way for doing that is to submit incremental
patches improving the driver.

As I wrote on another reply to this thread:

No, I don't have such card, nor I have any personal preference between
your version or Tsukada's one.

I might be ordering one and test here with my RF generators or ISDB-T
live, but very likely I won't have any time for coding, as my duties
as the maintainers require my attention on other things too. Also,
the problem here is not the lack of a developer for it, but, instead,
the lack of coordination between two developers.

So, I very much prefer if you could agree one with another around
a series of patches that would improve the driver without causing
regressions.

Regards,
Mauro
