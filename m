Hi,

my Zolid Hybrid TV Tuner has been working like a charm for over two
months now. The remote control is not working though, which is a
showstopper. I don't have experience with remote controls in any kind,
I've heard of LIRC but I would rather choose a more elegant solution,
for instance evdev in X11.

It's wiki page: http://www.linuxtv.org/wiki/index.php/Zolid_Hybrid_TV_Tuner


Thanks in advance!
