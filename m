Hmm  I understand.
I guess, at first, we need test program for it.

Hmm..  strange...
No kernel patch is needed to use tw9910 on Ecovec.

Ahh...
Maybe the criminal is dip-switch.
We can not use "tw9910" and "2nd camera" in same time.

Please check DS2[3] on Ecovec.
It should OFF when you use tw9910.

I wrote dip-switch info on top of
${LINUX}/arch/sh/boards/mach-ecovec24/setup.c
Please check it too.

Best regards
