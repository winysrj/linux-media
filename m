I have the HRV-1300 in a VIA EPIA based system running mythtv. So far I
have only tested the analog part (does not have dvb-t reception/antenna
yet).

Well, the HW encoder is sort of working. The problem is that I cannot
change channel (tuning) when reading the mpeg stream. I also have a
problem with the audio being interupted about every 5 seconds with a
loud static noice and then resuming to normal. 

I haven't really put the time and effort into this part (the TV-card) of
the setup, so at the moment I only have the MPEG device mapped in
mythtv. Previously I tried the unencoded device node and that seemed to
work, but unfortunately my system is too slow to recode this and re-read
it for display to wath live-tv. Will probably revert to using the
unencoded device since we don't use the system for livetv.

For information, system currently runs these software versions:
v4l-dvb from mercurial (last checkout was September 28)
gentoo based system with kernel 2.6.25-tuxonice-r6
media-tv/mythtv-0.20.2_p15634
