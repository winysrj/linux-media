I'm interested. I like the idea of some cross-subsystem pollination,
talking with the ALSA people for example ... and given that ARM is
growing, I'd like to catch up and understand where ARM silicon is
heading in terms of embedded video decoding and any support for
hardware specific features we may / may not have / need.

... and of course, if we have anyone from Intel then we should be
asking if/when their Intel Media SDK (hardware H264  encoding) is
going to become a reality, or possibly kickstart that process.
