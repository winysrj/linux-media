I had a similar problem a few months ago with a TeVii S660.
I am running (K)Ubuntu 15.10 (Wily Werewolf).
It didn't work correctly with the Ubuntu driver even after installing 
the firmware.

Compiling the driver from TeVii's site also said my kernel was not 
supported.
I guess it doesn't support 4.x kernels.

I wanted a quick solution to watch the Rugby World Cup while my wife was 
watching another program.
As it worked on Windows I didn't try to fix it at the time but I could 
have a go.

Cheers,
Chris
