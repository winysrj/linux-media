Thanks for your answer.

The French frequencies are (almost) all included in the 
"auto-With167kHzOffsets" file.
In fact, the offset can officially be -167, 0, +167 (which are included 
in this file), but also +333 and +500 (see page 11 of 
http://www.csa.fr/upload/publication/CSATNT.pdf )

I checked that all the frequencies currently declared in the 19 fr-* 
files (remaining after this cleanup : 
http://linuxtv.org/hg/dvb-apps/rev/795f75601b73 ) are included in 
"auto-With167kHzOffsets" (except that some use a 166kHz offset instead 
of 167kHz : I suppose this difference of 1kHz can be ignored)

I checked each of these 19 existing fr-* files (see 
http://linuxtv.org/hg/dvb-apps/file/93a96e9ce765/util/scan/dvb-t ) to 
see if the frequencies were outdated (compared to the official 
frequencies : 
http://www.tousaunumerique.fr/professionnels/en-savoir-plus/documentation/categorie-doc/plans-de-frequences/ 
)
Most of them ARE outdated, except :
- Brest and Laval (frequencies are correct)
- Toulouse, because the frequencies will only change on November 8th 2011
- I have a doubt for Villebon because I did not find which transponder 
it uses

I saw that w-scan uses only the offsets -167, 0, and +167 for country 
FR. I suppose they're the most usual ones.

I would suggest to :
- delete the 19 remaining fr-* files
- make the French users use the auto-With167kHzOffsets file (should we 
create a fr-All file, that would be a link to auto-With167kHzOffsets ?)
- create a file with a more complete list of frequencies, that would 
also include the +333 and +500 offsets, in case they were used. We might 
call it auto-WithUnusualOffsets for example
I might provide a patch for that, of course.

I have put in copy of this email the authors of some of the existing 
fr-* files (Maybe some of these addresses are now invalid). If you 
missed the beginning of the thread :

What's your opinion?
