A BUG_ON makes any error message disappear pretty quickly :)

I'm talking about foolish "ASSERT-like" BUG_ON that driver authors like
to add to their code when writing it to catch things they are messing
up.  After the code is working, they should be removed, like this one.

Don't enforce an api requirement with a kernel crash, warn and return an
error which the caller should always be checking anyway.
