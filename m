Sorry, my wording was self-conflicting. The intention was to
suggest providing an enum saying which table to use. Not that the
platform data would provide the whole table.

Agreed.

Based on the latest patch, more of these bits need to be controlled
individually than I figured. So yes, individual meaningful bits do make
the most sense.
