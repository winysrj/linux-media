IMO V4L is much better fit for this kind of devices than IIO. You can use
just a subset of the API, it shouldn't take much effort to write a simple
v4l2 capture driver, supporting fixed (probably vendor/chip specific) image
format.  I'm not sure if it's better to use the v4l2 controls [1], define
a new v4l2 controls class for the fingerprint scanner processing features,
rather than trying to pass raw data to user space and interpret it then
in some library.  I know there has been resistance to allowing passing
unknown binary blobs to user space, due to possible abuses.

You can use the v4l2 controls API for that, which also supports events.
The controls could be made read only.
It would be interesting to list what kind of features these could be.

This could be all well handled with the v4l2 controls, for instance see
what features are available in the Camera Flash controls subset

I would try it with V4L2, it seems to me most suitable subsystem for such
devices to me.  The question is what ends up in the kernel and what in user
space.  Anyway IMO V4L2 API is quite flexible with regards to that, due to
wide range of devices it needs to cover.
