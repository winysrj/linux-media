I added some printk entries and finally got suspicious output after

rmmod cx88_blackbird ; modprobe cx88_blackbird debug=true

[...]

   // BANG !!!!!!!!!!!!!!! core->active_ref=-1
[cx88-blackbird.c,mpeg_release(),line 1129] drv->request_release(drv); 
// drv->core->active_ref=(0->0)
[cx88-blackbird.c,mpeg_release(),line 1133] 
mutex_unlock(&dev->core->lock); // normal exit
cx88[1]/2-bb: cx8802_blackbird_probe
[...]

Analyzing this lead me to the conclusion, that a call to mpeg_open() in 
cx88-blackbird.c
returns with 0 (= success)
while not actually having increased the active_ref count.

Here's the relevant code fragment ...

static int mpeg_open(struct file *file)
{
[...]
     /* Make sure we can acquire the hardware */
     drv = cx8802_get_driver(dev, CX88_MPEG_BLACKBIRD);      // HOW TO 
DEAL WITH NULL  ??????
     if (drv) {
         err = drv->request_acquire(drv);
         if(err != 0) {
             dprintk(1,"%s: Unable to acquire hardware, %d\n", __func__, 
err);
             mutex_unlock(&dev->core->lock);
             return err;
         }
     }
[...]
     return 0;
}

I suspect, that

drv = cx8802_get_driver(dev, CX88_MPEG_BLACKBIRD);

in my case might evaluates to NULL (not normally but during driver 
initialization!?)
which then leads to

1) mpeg_open() returns with success

and

2) active_ref count has not been increased

which results in a negative active_ref count later on.

But I might as well be totally wrong.
