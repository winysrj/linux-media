The type tells what the behavior is of an entity. E.g., type DEVNODE
represents device node(s) in userspace, V4L2_SUBDEV represents a v4l2
sub-device, etc. The subtype tells whether a V4L2_SUBDEV is a sensor or a
receiver or whatever. Nice to know, but it doesn't change the way
sub-devices work.

In the case of connectors you would create a CONNECTOR type and have a
bunch of subtypes for all the variations of connectors.

That said, I'm not sure whether the distinction is useful for DEVNODEs.
You do need to know the subtype in order to interpret the union correctly.

Laurent, does the MC code test against the DEVNODE type? I.e., does the MC
code ignore the subtype of a DEVNODE, or does it always use it?

Regards,

        Hans
