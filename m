Well, DVB-S/S2 seems to be finally supported using a current kernel (3.11).

I get the following files under /dev/dvb/adapter0:

demux0
dvr0
frontend0
net0

w_scan also works (as described here[1]).

But the card has multiple tuners (DVB-T/C and analogue as well) which are
not recognized.

Is there any information I can give you to help support this card?

I have little experience in C but no experience in programming hardware, but
am willing to help in anyway needed.

Kind regards
Christoph
