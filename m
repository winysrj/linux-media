Yes. Sometimes I lose my temper. If you ask me how to avoid it - I do
not know. I'll keep on trying.

The more important question is:
Is there a way to lift the ban?

NOT to at least show a way is malicious.

It's not that my self-confidence depends on such an idiotic punishment.
But lifting the ban would make things easier (-> stigmatization effects
by people not concerned with the causes of the ban f. ex.).

Thanks
