Let's do this Tuesday. Let's meet at the Linux Foundation Registration
Desk at 11:00. I'll try to figure out where we can sit the day before.
Please check your email Tuesday morning for any last minute changes.

Tomasz, it would be nice indeed if we can get you and Paul in as well
using Hangouts on my laptop.

I would very much appreciate it if those who have experience with the
userspace support think about this beforehand and make some requirements
list of what you would like to see.

Regards,

	Hans
