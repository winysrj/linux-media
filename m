Hi,

I accidentally purchased a dvico fusionhtdtv dual express>2< rather than
just a plain dual express and I've since found out the express 2 is
not supported.
Cheeky to ask, but I was just wondering if anyone happened to be working on
support for this in ubuntu 10.04?
I'm trying to decide if I should ebay this card or or not...

thanks for your time
Kristin.
