I've submitted a proposal for a Linux HTPC presentation, intending to
cover everything from low-level v4l/dvb drivers, video decoder drivers
and IR drivers, up the stack to userspace (primarily mythtv and a bit
of xbmc). Also submitted a micro-conf proposal for media-related bits,
as I didn't see one yet, and at the time, the proposal submission
deadline was only a day or two out (this was before it got extended to
the 26th) and I believe you were on vacation, so your submission and
mine are essentially duplicates.
