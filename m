If only I could pay for a *decent* one.

If I just want bandwidth at a poor level of service, poor reliability
and high cost, then I'll pay for the local cable TV internet service.

I'm in one of the white areas on the map on page 33 of:

I don't really have options for getting a good value for my dollar on
broadband internet.

(The residential broadband deployment in the US is just terrible IMO.)
