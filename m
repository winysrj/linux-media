As I wrote several times earlier, MMAP uses fixed number of buffers. In

some tightly controlled media pipeline with low latency, it might work.



But in general, the V4L element in the pipeline does not know how fast the

downstream element(s) will consume the buffers. Thus it has to copy from

the MMAP buffers into anonymous user memory pending processing. Then any

dequeued buffer can be requeued as soon as possible. In theory, it might

also be that, even though the latency is known, the number of required

buffers exceeds the maximum MMAP buffers count of the V4L device. Either

way, user space ends up doing memory copy from MMAP to custom buffers.



This problem does not exist with USERBUF - the V4L2 element can simply

allocate a new buffer for each dequeued buffer.



By the way, this was already discussed a few months ago for the exact same

DMABUF patch series...
