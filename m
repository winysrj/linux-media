Does that mean that there are devices out in the wild that report for 
example USB_CLASS_WIRELESS_CONTROLLER for the video interface ???

Hmm, sure, that would work...
But wouldn't it be better to improve the interface check and merge the 
two probing functions ?
The subdrivers can decide which interfaces are (not) probed and the 
gspca core does plausability checks (e.g. bulk/isoc endpoint ? usb class ?).
