Dear sirs,

I'm a systems engineer (from spain, so excuse my bad english) working
for some time with all kinds of TV receivers.

First I wanted to thank you all for your work.

I saw that sometimes your tips on this list are very helpfull, so I
wanted to make you a question that maybe you can help me with.

I've been working for some time with those devices, and recently I have
a problem which I've never seen before. The point is that I tune
properly frequency and I start watching all channels, but after some
time  one or 2 tuners stops, and you cannot tune again any frequency
until you reboot all server.

One thing very strange there is that always are the same tuners which
fails. Signal is OK.

I don't have any error on syslog nor dmesg. And once you reboot it works
again.

Have anyone seen this problem before and can help me please?

Thanks a lot for your time,
Kind regards

Marc.
