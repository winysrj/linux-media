MythTV, for example, used to use the driver version to work around old
VBI bugs and MPEG encoder quirks that the older version of the driver
may not have known how to handle:

https://github.com/MythTV/mythtv/blob/b98d3a98e3187000ae652df5ffebe2beb5221ba7/mythtv/libs/libmythtv/mpegrecorder.cpp#L335

But for newer versions, MythTV could avoid using its own odd hacks.
The bleeding edge MythTV now has most of these removed.

That seems to be the case to me.

Well, not even panics per se, but some thing like the VBI is broken, or
the volume control doesn't work, IR blaster is works for this version,
or something else stupid that is very visible to the end user.

I also use the driver version for troubleshooting problem with users.  I
roughly know what wasn't working in what version of the cx18 and ivtv
drivers.  If the end user can tell me the driver version (using v4l2-ctl
--log-status) along with his symptoms, it makes my life easier.  Being
able to efficiently help the end user is a win for both me and the end
user.

Yup.  We do have crummier solutions:

Telling the end user to read their kernel source code to figure out what
bugs their driver release has, and to then adjust their application
command line arguments accordingly. ;)
