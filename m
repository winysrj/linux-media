Kernel version: Linux davslaptop-hardy 2.6.24-12-generic (ubuntu hardy 
current) running amd64.  I have replaced my old installation so can't 
boot a 2.6.22 kernel anymore on this hardware, but will try to get round 
to running the hardy stuff on my actual mythbox (an epia) to see if I 
get similar disconnects (this machine is still running gutsy 
currently).  I should note that I was able to tune and watch tv ok with 
my gutsy install on the laptop mentioned before with at least the nova-t 
(and I think the td also).  Thanks for swift feedback.
