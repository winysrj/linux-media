For MC drivers each video node has just a single input or output: it cannot be used
to switch between inputs, since that depends on the configured video pipeline.

It's just there to satisfy existing applications. I also think it can be useful
to provide quick information about the device where possible, e.g. "scalar input",
"bayer capture", etc.
