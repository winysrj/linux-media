Subject: [PATCH 0/2] DaVinci: VPIF: upgrade with v4l helpers

Hi All,

This patch series upgrades the vpif capture & display
driver with the all the helpers provided by v4l, this makes
the driver much simpler and cleaner. This also includes few
checkpatch issues.

Sending them as single patch one for capture and another for
display, splitting them would have caused a huge number small
patches.
