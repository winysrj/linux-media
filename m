I think if we wanted to do this with a new file operation, the best
way would be to do the copy_from_user()/copy_to_user() in the caller
as well.

We already do this inside of some subsystems, notably drivers/media/,
and it simplifies the implementation of the ioctl handler function
significantly. We obviously cannot do this in general, both because of
traditional drivers that have 16-bit command codes (drivers/tty and others)
and also because of drivers that by accident defined the commands
incorrectly and use the wrong type or the wrong direction in the
definition.
