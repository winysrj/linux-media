Hello,

I'm trying to understand what is the current state of the multiple virtual
channel support in V4L2 and Media framework. This is the last activity
on this topic which I was able to find. Is anything new happened since
this RFC, is someone working on this or planing to work on?

Best regards,
Todor Tomov
