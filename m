This is not a PCI latency problem.

You appear to be experiencing PCI bus errors.  Read errors on the PCI
bus return 0xffffffff and it looks like that's happening on your system:

	(rev ff) (prog-if ff)

PCI bus error are usually caused by the PCI bridge chips on your
motherboard being overwhelmed or by bus signals of marginal quality or,
of course, by actually defective hardware.

As something simple and easy to try, I would suggest:

1. Remove *all* your PCI cards
2. Blow the dust out of *all* the slots.
3. Reseat the cards.

That will hopefully improve the signal quality on the bus.

You may also want to test with only 1 video capture card installed at
first.

Regards,
Andy
