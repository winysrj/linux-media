We have a bunch of 530's (well over 100) for encoding a bunch of video
content into an IPTV system -- but unfortunately, the encoding computers
all run Windows.

I spent some time trying to make a 530 work in Linux - with the results
you describe above.  

I would love for the SDI input to work in Linux - but since I'm using
openSuSE the default kernel on the OS is customized.  I previously
pulled down a "supported" kernel from kernel.org and installed it, but
even after doing that I was still unable to see the BTTV stuff work
properly.

When I inquired of them previously, here was their response:

In other words, I got the typical manufacturer's brush-off of "go to the
community for support with the community software - we aren't interested
enough to really get involved."


To date, I have not heard of anyone successfully running the Osprey 530
in Linux with normal ability to capture composite, S-Video, and SDI
inputs.

Similarly, I have not heard of any other SDI capture card working in
Linux, but due to the quantity of Osprey 530 cards we have I'd much
rather see this card work.

Good luck.
