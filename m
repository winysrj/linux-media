The m2m context / queue handling and job scheduling are very useful even
for drivers that don't always produce one CAPTURE buffer from one OUTPUT
buffer, just as you drescribe below.
The CODA encoder path fits the m2m model perfectly. I'd prefer not to
duplicate most of mem2mem just because the decoder doesn't.

There's two things that this patch allows me to do:
a) running mem2mem device_run with an empty OUTPUT queue, which is
   something I'd really like to make possible.
b) running mem2mem device_run with the OUTPUT queue in STREAM OFF, which
   I needed to get the remaining buffers out. But maybe there is a
   better way to do this while keeping the output queue streaming.

I'm not set on using STREAMOFF to signal the stream-end condition to the
hardware, but after switching to stream-end mode, no new frames should
be queued, so I thought it fit quite well. It also allows to prepare the
OUTPUT buffers (S_FMT/REQBUFS) for the next STREAMON while the CAPTURE
side is still draining the bitstream, although that's probably not a
very useful feature.
I could instead have userspace signal the driver via an EOS buffer flag
or any other mechanism. Then the OUTPUT queue would be kept streaming,
but hold back all buffers queued via QBUF until the last buffer is
dequeued from the CAPTURE queue.

Maybe I've missed something, but I thought the EOS signal is only for
the driver to signal to userspace that the currently dequeued frame is
the last one?
I need userspace to signal to the driver that it won't queue any new
OUTPUT buffers, but still wants to dequeue the remaining CAPTURE buffers
until the bitstream buffer is empty.
