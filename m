Hmm... please correct me if I'm wrong, but are you wanting to replace an existing
driver at drivers/media/platform/davinci, by another one at staging that has
lots of known issues, as pointed at your TODO????

If so, please don't do that. Replacing a driver by some other one is generally
a very bad idea, especially in this case, where the new driver has clearly several
issues, the main one being to define its own proprietary and undocumented API:

Among other things, with those ugly and very likely mandatory API calls:

>+ * VIDIOC_VPFE_IPIPEIF_G_CONFIG: Get IPIEIF configuration

I remember we rejected already drivers like that with obscure "S_CONFIG"
private ioctl that were suspect to send a big initialization undocumented
blob to the driver, as only the vendor's application would be able to use
such driver.

So, instead, of submitting it to staging, you should be sending incremental
patches for the existing driver, adding newer functionality there, and 
using the proper V4L2 API, with makes life easier for reviewers and
application developers.

Mauro
