I can believe that. But I am also inclined to believe that DMABUF is

targetted at device-to-device transfer, while USERPTR is targetted at

device-to-user (or user-to-device) transfers. Are you saying applications

should use DMABUF and memory map the buffers? Or would you care to explain

how DMABUF addresses the problem space of USERPTR?

It is not only a simplification. In some cases, USERPTR is the only I/O

method that supports zero copy in pretty much any circumstance. When the

user cannot reliably predict the maximum number of required buffers,

predicts a value larger than the device will negotiate, or needs buffers to

outlive STREAMOFF (?), MMAP requires memory copying. USERPTR does not.



Now, I do realize that some devices cannot support USERPTR efficiently,

then they should not support USERPTR. But for those devices that can, it

seems quite a nice performance enhancement.
