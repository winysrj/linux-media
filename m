No. Video loopback is just a way for an application to expose a virtual

camera, for another application to use. It is not a way to share a camera

within two applications.



Sharing a camera is fundamentally impossible due to the limitation of the

hardware, which cannot capture in two different formats and sets of buffers

simultaneously. Live with it.
