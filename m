If the property is being changed anyways, why not going with No1 then?

As I said, I'm not against the patch but I think the commit message
has to be reworded since implies that the problem is that the -gpio
sufix is being used instead of -gpios. But since both are supported by
the GPIO subsystem, the commit should mention that "reset" is more
clear and easier to read than "rst" or something along those lines.

BTW, I just posted a patch for the GPIO doc to mention that -gpio is
also supported:
