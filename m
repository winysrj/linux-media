If you are talking about the mantis driver in Linus' mainline kernels,
then it isn't updated at all since it was merged.  No need to try
different kernels. They are all the same with respect to this driver.

But the mantis driver went through a lot of changes during the very
active development before it was merged, and the CA code used to be
enabled at some point.  But I do not know if it worked.  And there were
most likely very good reasons to disable it...

Google will know.
