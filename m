I can't disagree. Given that there is no way to enforce the rule, it is
likely not everybody will follow it.

directly from the rest of your code.

That being said, that doesn't mean drivers aren't actually doing it.

I'm not sure if this comparison really holds. When you free memory,
nobody is supposed to use that memory afterwards, so whether it contains
pointers to other memory locations is irrelevant. Unbinding a device
doesn't make it disappear, it might still get access, now or later, so
the value of struct device members is more relevant. But of course we
can discuss the guarantees made on these struct members over the
device's lifetime. I don't this is documented anywhere.

I tend to agree, now.

Wolfram, how do you feel about this? I feel a little sorry that I more
or less encouraged you to submit this patch series, and now I get to
agree with the objections which were raised against it.

My key motivation was that I wanted i2c_set_clientdata() to be called
before kfree(). Now that everybody seems to agree that the latter
belongs to the drivers while the former belongs to lower layers
(i2c-core or even driver core), this is not going to happen. So I guess
we want to remove calls to i2c_set_clientdata(NULL) from all drivers
and have only one in i2c-core for now?
