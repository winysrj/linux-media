This proposal makes it very hard for applications to directly select a
format like 720p50 because the indices can change at any time. I think
this is a very desirable feature, particularly for apps running on
embedded systems where the hardware is known. This was one of the design
considerations at the time this API was made.

But looking at this I wonder if we shouldn't just make a
VIDIOC_G_PRESET_TIMINGS function? You give it the preset ID and you get
all the timing information back. No need to deprecate anything. I'm not
even sure if with this change we need to modify struct v4l2_dv_enum_preset
as I proposed in my RFC, although I think we should.
