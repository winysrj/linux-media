Hmm, this also highlights another deficiency in the spec. Currently
the description of IMMUTABLE says:

"The link enabled state canâ€™t be modified at runtime. An immutable link
 is always enabled."

But in the plan above the link can change, but only the driver can
enable/disable the link. It makes no sense AFAICS for userspace to
enable/disable an interface link.

If I am right that it makes no sense for userspace to disable an interface
link, then we should update the spec to clarify that this is not allowed
(in fact, it is not possible today anyway). And we should also clarify
that the driver can disable an interface link and what that means.

If userspace CAN in some circumstances disable an interface link, then
we need to add something like a READ_ONLY flag to signal whether or not
userspace can change an interface link. If it is READ_ONLY, then only the
driver can change that.

That said, given that today there are no drivers that disable an interface
link, I still think that we should mark them all as IMMUTABLE. That flag
can be removed when we actually let drivers change this.

It would be consistent with the current usage of interface links.
