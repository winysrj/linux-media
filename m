The problem with negotiating tiling in the kernel for at least
drm/i915 is that userspace needs to know the tiling and for allocating
actually be in charge of it. The approach used by prime thus far is to
simply use linear buffers between different gpus. If you want
something better I guess you need to have a fairly tightly integrate
userspace driver, so I don't see how passing around the tiling
information should be an issue for those cases.
