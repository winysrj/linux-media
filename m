Yuck ;-)

Anyway, what I was thinking of is something like:

	T0		T1

	try A
			lock B
	lock B
			lock A

Now, if for some reason T1 won the lottery such that T0 would have to be
wounded, T0's context would indicate its the first entry and not return
-EDEADLK.

OTOH, anybody doing creative things like that might well deserve
whatever they get ;-)
