Indeed. At this point, its become a community disservice not to have a
redirect/pointer to the new list.

Is there anyone at Red Hat who can set up an auto reply redirector to
the Linux Media Mailing List
(http://vger.kernel.org/vger-lists.html#linux-media ) for any new mails
set into the v4l mailing list?

I don't know how many people are still subscribed to the v4l, but that
number is got to be dwindling, and I think its long about past the time
that we turn the lights off.
