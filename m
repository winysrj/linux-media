Ok, thanks for the reminder. I must have completely missed this part
of the discussion.

When I briefly considered this problem, my own conclusion was that
the number of atomic DMA allocations would always be very low
because they tend to be short-lived (e.g. incoming network packets),
so we could ignore this problem and just use a smaller reservation
size. While this seems to be true in general (see "git grep -w -A3 
dma_alloc_coherent | grep ATOMIC"), there is one very significant
case that we cannot ignore, which is pci_alloc_consistent.

This function is still called by hundreds of PCI drivers and always
does dma_alloc_coherent(..., GFP_ATOMIC), even for long-lived
allocations and those that are too large to be ignored.

So at least for the case where we have PCI devices, I agree that
we need to have the dynamic pool.
