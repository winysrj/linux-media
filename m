Do we really have them, or just the documents say they exist?

As legal as the mentioned dma_coherent?

Has this been experienced? I had some ARM-compatible boards on my desk
(xscale, v6 and v7) and none of them crashed due to this behavior. And
we *do* have multiple memory mappings, with different attributes.

Just great. Nothing short of spectacular - this way the IA32 is going to
take the embedded market piece by piece once the big two advance their
foundry processes.
Despite having the translator, so much burden in the legacy ISA and the
fact that most of the embedded engineers from the high end are
accustomed to the ARM.

In other words, should we take your response as yet another NAK?
Or would you try harder and at least point us to some direction that
would not doom the effort from the very beginning.
I understand that the role of an oracle is so much easier, but the time
is running and devising subsequent solutions is not the use of
engineers' time.
