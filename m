Hi,

I have not been able to put any serious time into this project, and I'd like to reiterate my offer to buy one of these devices (http://www.dealextreme.com/details.dx/sku.15569) for an experienced v4l developer who would like to give it a try.  I will stay in the loop for testing (FC10 on Dell SC1420).

Blame my new girlfriend: My evenings are no longer my own. And I don't mind it one bit!

-BobC
