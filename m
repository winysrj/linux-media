The rc-core register (and the corresponding input register) is done when
the device detected a remote controller, so, it should be safe to register
on that point. If not, IMHO, there's a bug somewhere. 

Yet, I agree that udev tries to set devices too fast. It would be better if
it would wait for a few milisseconds, to reduce the risk of race conditions.

Ok, the last line says it is a ivtv board, using IR. However, it doesn't show
the I2C detection of other devices that might be racing to gain access to the
I2C bus, nor if some OOPS were hit by kernel.

I don't have any ivtv boards handy, but there are some developers at
linux-media ML that may help with this.

Yes, it can, if you add the IR protocol selection on that tool. A remote 
controller keycode table has both the protocol and the keycodes.
This basically means to merge 99% of the logic inside ir-keytable into the
evdev generic tool.

I'm not against it, although I prefer a specialized tool for RC.

I agree with you, but I'm not sure if we can find a solution that will
work for both RC and media keyboards, as X11 evdev just maps keyboards
on the 8-255 range. I was thinking to add a detection there for RC, and
use a separate map for them, as RC don't need most of the normal keyboard
keys.
