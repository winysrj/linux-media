Hi Devin, i have really good news, i have contacted Terratec about the 
problem with this stick (ID: 0ccd:0072) and linux kernel, they are 
really interested in supporting the linux community and they would 
donate some cards to linux developers for driver developing (i think 
they can send you all the cards you need), they only need direct contact 
with you, can i mail you in private for the details ?

thanks in advance
