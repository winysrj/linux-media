Hello,

I have a Pinnacle PCTV Hybrid Stick Solo 340e SE which identifies as 
"2304:023e" with lsusb.
After searching the web for almost two days now I did not find any 
working solution in getting this DVB-T USB stick to work under Ubuntu 
9.04 UNR. When I found this thread 
(http://marc.info/?l=linux-dvb&w=2&r=1&s=340e&q=b) and started reading 
it I hoped that I would find a hint or something, but it seems that the 
last post was on 2008-08-22? Were there any improvements in getting this 
card to work since then? I would really appreciate any help in getting 
this card to work under Ubuntu UNR 9.04 on my Acer Aspire One...


Thanks in advance and best regards,
Lars.
