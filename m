I'm not talking about raw mode here. lircd will happily decode the signals  
despite of any timing error as long it's consistent.

I'm still interested how JVC can be confused with NEC codes.

The function f(x) = 50 is not bijective. No way to compensate.

Missing bits cannot be magically regenerated by the driver.

There is a firmware patch available? Do you have a pointer?
