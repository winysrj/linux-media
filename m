Like my previous email, I complained that dvbv5-scan does not find ANY DVBS2 channels on Astra28E, even with a single transponder listed in the source frequency file.

I complained about this on 05/02/2016 15:05 and nothing has so far been does. It STILL fails.

No doubt Mauro or whoever the hell looks after this list will ban my email address again.
