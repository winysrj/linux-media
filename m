Why is the old dvb (linux-dvb) mailing list still alive?

One of the arguments migrating all dvb related stuff to this combined ml 
was to reduce overhead.
But in fact some information might be lost now, since not everybody will 
look at both ML's.
Wouldn't it be a good idea to close the old ml now / is this foreseen at 
all?
