I disagree it's more "evil" (or at least I fail to see how it would be). 
Accepting but ignoring "lirc" means that the same commands as before 
will still be accepted (so pre-existing userspace scripts won't have to 
change which they would if we made "lirc" an invalid protocol to echo to 
the sysfs file).

And saying that the change will "break" userspace is still something of 
a misnomer. You'd basically expect userspace to open /sys/blabla, write 
"-lirc" (which would disable the lirc output but the device node is 
still in /dev), then later open /dev/lircX and be surprised that it's 
still receiving lirc events on the lirc device it just opened? I think 
that's a rather artificial scenario...

I could write a different patch that removes the protocol enum but still 
allows lirc to be disabled/enabled. I doubt it'll be that simple though 
(ugly hack rather), and I still don't see the benefits of doing so (or 
downsides or "breakage" of not doing it).

Another option would be to commit the change a see if anyone screams (I 
very much doubt it).
