O_NONBLOCK doesn't mean that an ioctl must consume zero time. It just
means that it should return instead of waiting for (more) data to become
available or writeable.

Mauro, if the network is broken, any application using the network will
break. No specially designed protocol will fix that.

If you want to enforce strict maximum latencies, you can do that in the
userspace daemon using the vtunerc interface. It has all imaginable
possibilities to control data flow over the network and to return errors
to vtunerc. For a DVB API application it doesn't matter whether a tuning
request fails with EIO because a USB device has been removed, a PCI
device encountered an I2C error or because the vtuner userspace daemon
returned an error.

To the best of my knowledge, this doesn't happen.

I think we all realized some days ago that the code is not going to be
merged upstream anytime in the foreseeable future. You can stop using
such pointless arguments.
