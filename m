Thanks!

Yeah, I hear you.

Not sure if you got my point: the main point of removing MODULE_AUTHOR
and other copyright stuff is that such patch may easily be doing something
that could be considered a copyright violation, being bad not only to
the affected driver, but to the entire Kernel.

So, we need to handle it with due care. Getting other authors's
acks on such patch seems to be the only safe way of doing that.

Mauro
