Good point, I had overlooked that but we do have same requirement for
cropping as well.. although in the crtc we already specify an x/y
offset within the drm_framebuffer that the crtc is attached to.. so I
guess if we have an input width/height (output is implied I guess by
the encoder/connector) then we should be fine for cropping

Although in some cases top/left crop offset could be changing frame by
frame (think use cases like zero-copy video stabilization or pan/scan)
so might be nice to have a way to specify new x/y offset when
flipping.  I guess that would be an extension/change to existing page
flip ioctl.
