I don't agree. If AM35x doesn't expose the MC API to userspace, 
CONFIG_MEDIA_CONTROLLER should not be required at all.

Also, according with the Linux best practices, when  #if tests for config
symbols are required, developers should put it into the header files, and
not inside the code, as it helps to improve code readability. From
Documentation/SubmittingPatches:

	2) #ifdefs are ugly

	Code cluttered with ifdefs is difficult to read and maintain.  Don't do
	it.  Instead, put your ifdefs in a header, and conditionally define
	'static inline' functions, or macros, which are used in the code.
	Let the compiler optimize away the "no-op" case.

So, this patch is perfectly fine on my eyes.

Mauro
