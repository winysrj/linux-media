Hi,

like previous years, we're going to hold a meeting to discuss
lowlevel audio on Linux.  This time it's along with Linux Plumbers
conference, but for avoiding the conflicts with other LPC mini
conferences (including Media Mini-summit, of course :), it'll be held
on Tuesday October 14, at the same venue as LPC, Congress Center
DÃ¼sseldorf, Germany.

If anyone is interested, feel free to sign up in the attendee list
below.  It's a public accessible Google doc, so you can edit freely.
