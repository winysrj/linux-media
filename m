I'm not very well versed at the V4L intricacies, and correct me if I got it wrong,
but it seems like you have the  problem on needing to probe a bunch of devices only after 
the parent device has been probed successfully. 
Your async subdevice probing method seems to be doing this.

It might be simpler to do something like this:

v4ldevice {
	compatible = "foo,v4ldev";
	...
	overlay {
		fragment@0 {
			target = <&i2c0>;
			__overlay__ {
				...
				/* i2c devices */
			};
		};
		fragment@0 {
			target = <&ocp>;
			__overlay__ {
				..
				/* platform devices */
			};
		};
		...
	}:
};

And in the probe of the v4ldev apply the overlay. The i2c devices will end up in the
i2c node, the platform devices to the ocp node, etc, and will be registered.

There is nothing preventing the overlay being in a part of the board dts file. 
You will need to do a resolve pass for the phandles, but it's not insurmountable IMO.
