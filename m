I re-write the driver, and also the first version of the driver has many 
modification made by me, many bug fix, style review, remove useless code.
The first time I didn't add myself as author because the logic of the driver 
did not change. This time, plus the old change I think there is nothing of the 
original driver because I rewrite it from the hardware manual. Practically, It 
is a new driver for the same device.

Anyway I will try to contact the original authors for the acked-by.

I will try also for this. But I think that this is not a windriver driver 
because I re-wrote it from the hardware manual. I used the old driver because 
I thought that it was better than propose a patch that remove the old driver 
and add my driver.
I did not remove the 2010 Copyright from windriver, because they did the job, 
but this work was paid by ST (copyright 2012) and made completely by me.

Is my thinking wrong?

Just a question for the future so I avoid to redo the same error. If I re-
wrote most of a driver I cannot change the authorship automatically without 
the acked-by of the previous author. If I ask to the previous author and he 
does not give me the acked-by (or he is unreachable, he change email address), 
then the driver is written by me but the author is someone else? Right? So, it 
is better if I propose a patch which remove a driver and a patch which add my 
driver?

Thank you
