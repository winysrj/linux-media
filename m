Do we need to classify actual devices based on this? I think it's rather 
a different API behaviour between the LED and the V4L2 APIs.

On devices that are slow to control, the behaviour should be asynchronous
over the LED API and synchronous when accessed through the V4L2 API. How
about implementing the work queue, as I have suggested, in the framework, so
that individual drivers don't need to care about this and just implement the
synchronous variant of this op? A flag could be added to distinguish devices
that are fast so that the work queue isn't needed.

It'd be nice to avoid individual drivers having to implement multiple ops to
do the same thing, just for differing user space interfacs.
