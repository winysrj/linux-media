I think there is some missunderstanding about the issue I'm facing.
When I have a lock, it does report all the SCVYL bits.
The problem occurs when there is no lock. For instance if you try to
tune to a transponder with an invalid symbol rate, you should get
SIGNAL and CARRIER but no SYNC.

Provided the demod would report that correctly, that'd allow me to try
other possible symbol rate and only do so when the demod detects a
carrier wave.

Since I'm probing a lot of frequencies, trying ~10 possible
symbol rates when there isn't a signal slows down the process a lot.
