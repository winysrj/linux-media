Hi Mauro,

that is all agreed.

But that [PATCH] in subject all lost or with unclear status as a minimum
have.

Is that not enough to provide the sender and the list with some message,
that his patch was not recognized and he should try again?

I would not complain, if there would be anything in sight improving the
situation, but in README.patches the word "patchwork" does not even
exist until now.

Especially there needs to be a hint, that patches already discussed and
with a tested-by on the list are treated like they did never exist, if
they do not make it into "patchwork".

Also for chapter 7 about patches from the community, BTW 8 and 7 are
swapped, that "make checkpatch" thing should be mentioned. You will
complain anyway later if stuff is not conform to it.

And SOBs already given at any list, I guess this includes LKML, are
worthless if not on the version that makes it into "patchwork"?

I get by far too much posts off lists from people just trying to add
some lines for new hardware, and I already had the fear Miroslav gave up
after all and we start losing patches. He did not try off list and is
wondering for months now.

My compliments go to CityK. I can see he followed everything carefully
and tries to give best possible instructions on the wiki. At least
something to point to now.

That patchwork transition was really a bumpy and unpaved road for close
to half a year now.

Cheers,
Hermann
