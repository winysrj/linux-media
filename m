I don't have a strong opinion either. Let's keep it as is, we can always
change it later.

Does 'this document' refer to this encoder chapter, or the whole v4l2 spec? It
might be better to provide an explicit link here.

Anyway, this is much better.

See my reply from a few minutes ago. I'm not convinced copying timestamps
makes sense for codecs.

I'd rephrase that last sentence to:

* Once the last buffer is returned the driver sends a ``V4L2_EVENT_EOS`` event.

Actually, yes. I think that would work quite well.

Also, the phrase "the driver must" can be replaced by "the encoder will"
which describes the behavior of the encoder, which in turn defines what
the underlying driver must do.
