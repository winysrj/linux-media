on that stage it is now, you can't call me to crawl the web or buy any
evaluation board, likely high priced, still not even providing a link.

If you use GNU/Linux, free of charge, you have to provide acceptable
documentation too.

This is lame. I do want to know what is out in the markets already and
no fall back on initial dip-switch comments. Comparable sensors ship
from China directly for some 5 Euros and less here.

This is a change (chance?) in culture too, and was already discussed in
1976 by some, but was at least public for all those a little bit more
interested since, let's say, 1982.

This is going on for a long time now, it did not hit the linuxtv.org
wiki at all until today, but introduces most relevant API changes. To
stop to provide support for older devices, in favor of the like of such
stuff, was mentioned several times already to get quicker to the
bonanza.

All major hardware manufacturers, and/or those claiming to be codec
possessors, have hired linux devel teams around the globe to move this
forward.

What it means, that everyone likely can film his life soon with two HD
cameras on mobile devices at once, let's say with 1080p for now, one
following his view to the "outside world", the other one pointing to
"him/her" at the same time, about that, there is no word on this list.

It is not about missing some dip switch settings on an evaluation board.

It is about missing documentation, but much more about missing
reflection, if GNU/Linux should give the vehicle for such.

And it obviously does, even without any further comments.

Cheers,
Hermann
