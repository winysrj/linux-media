Cut me a $25,000 check and I'll happily do it.  Otherwise, don't tell
a bunch of volunteer developers how they should be spending their
time.  What you happen to think is the important is not necessarily
what developers feel is the most valuable use of their time.

The reality is that there is *some* value a developer can contribute
in reviewing the content and providing feedback and a *TON* of grunt
work involved that can be done by anybody who takes the time to learn
docbook.  If someone wants to volunteer to do the former, I'm sure
some developers would be willing to do the latter.
