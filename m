Hi @all,

because i'm building a new TV-Box with a new ATOM-ION-Board which doesnt
have any PCI-Slots, i've been searching for a while for an USB-DVB-S-Box
with a Common Interface. In the Wiki i found this:
http://www.linuxtv.org/wiki/index.php/TechnoTrend_TT-connect_S2-3650_CI. But
i'm a bit confused about the line:

"It is currently unsupported, but experimental support has been attempted."

while at the bottom of this wikipage it is stated, that all parts are
working, even the CI. Can someone approve that it works completely?

And another question about another(?) USB-Box: I found this one: Satelco
Easywatch HDTV USB CI, which looks quite similar. Is this the same? Some
infos about it (sorry, only in german):

thanks, Jens
