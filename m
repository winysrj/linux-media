One thing is consistency with other parts of code... On all other places
is used dev_warn and on above 4 places WARN. dev_warn automatically adds
device name for easy debugging...

Another thing is that above WARNs do not write why it is warning. It
just write that some condition is not truth...

I mean: warning should have better description, what happened. Such
warning for somebody who does not see this code is not useful...

I think sending patch in unified diff format for such change is
overkill. Just place to header it.
