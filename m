You're eventually going to want to add ioctl's to set a lot of TX or RX 
parameters in one go (stuff like active receiver(s) and transmitter(s), 
carrier frequency, duty cycle, timeouts, filter levels and resolution - 
all of which would need to be set in one operation since some hardware 
will need to be reset after each parameter is changed).

Then you'll end up with a few things being controlled via sysfs and some 
being controlled via ioctls. Maybe it's a good idea to have a bitmask of 
supported and enabled protocols in those ioctls instead?
