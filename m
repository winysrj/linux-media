Ok, understood, modifying CHSEL register can adversely affect running 
streams.

Given above I understand why the stream count checks in 
__media_entity_setup_link() are insufficient, because only the requested 
link's source stream count is checked, and not the other CSI-2 receiver 
for example.

But why check the use counts of every entity upstream from the VIN 
sources? Why not check only the VIN source entities stream counts (both 
CSI-2 receivers and/or parallel devices), and ignore entities upstream 
from those?

And why are the use counts checked, it seems it should be the stream 
counts that should be checked.

Right, so rvin_group_link_notify() determines whether the requested VIN 
link enable will result in a valid set of CSI2->VIN links for the given 
hardware, using the CHSEL bitmask tables. Which is why it seems it is 
the stream counts that should be checked as mentioned above, rather than 
the use counts, because the CHSEL bitmask checks are validating the set 
of enabled links, and the only remaining checks are to verify no streams 
are running on either CSI-2 receiver.
