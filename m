Hi Guys,

In my apparently eternal quest for a decent HD capture card with support 
for v4l2 I couldn't find an existing table of cards, I've put one up the 
Wiki.  I hope I've done it correctly, these tables are horrible to maintain.

Anyhow if people would like to look at it, I'd be grateful for any 
comments, or indeed you can update the wiki directly.

Here is the link:

Regards,

Steve.
