OK, I missed that. It was a bit confusing to review.

OK, with these changes you have my

Acked-by: Hans Verkuil <hans.verkuil@cisco.com>

as well for this patch.

Just for my understanding: do you plan on merging this for 3.1? I have no objection to
that. Together with the querycap version changes it is easy to add compatibility support
to libv4l should that be necessary. I'm not convinced there won't be any fallout from
this change, but at least there is a decent way of working around it if needed. And there
is no doubt that -ENOTTY is a much better return code.

When this is merged I'll modify v4l2-compliance, v4l2-ctl (if necessary) and qv4l2.

Regards,

	Hans
