Hi Guys

Blackgold have just started shipping the BGT3620 Dual Tuner PCI-E
DVB-T2 card, as far as I know this is the first DVB-T2 card actually
shipping.

The link to the page is here.....

Is there any chance of getting some development of a Linux driver underway?

I'd be willing to organise a bounty payment to kick start things if it
would help.

Regards
