It's a major clean up from internal code. For various reasons the
previous history of the code can't be exposed (the internal repository
we have contains code that can't go out of Intel for example).

That's the goal for the ISP 2 driver (Baytrail/T and later
Cherrytrail). I can't speak for longer term plans with ISP 3 and later
devices which currently don't have upstream drivers. There are some
bits of support in ISP2 for some of the odder phone platforms as well
but I don't have a way to test them or think anyone cares so plan to
drop those.
