Same holds for pretty much every subsystem, right?

This would make it impossible to turn off all MFD drivers at once. I
think this is considered a feature, at least I find it very convenient
to be able to "kill" a subsystem completely. And in the past few years
many subsystems were turned from menu to menuconfig for this reason.
But maybe MFD is a special case here.

Anyway, if you want your patch to be applied, you'll have to send it
for review first, as at this point all we have is Luciano's proposal.
