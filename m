Sorry Devin I sent from the wrong account!!

Anyhow, it is actually a TV Tuner but I guess the resolution restricts it.

What would you suggest as a replacement product for it??

Basically what I need is for it to work globally in compatibility with 
all analog terrestrial streams and also digital and cable too.

The reason for this is I do some traveling at the moment bouncing back 
and forth between UK and Turkey which I think Turkey is PAL BETA if I'm 
not mistaken and  also since they don't have any digital broadcasting as 
of yet. They mainly use cable and satellite which they call digital for 
some strange reason??

Also since I'm done now with my studies and am looking for a job it 
could mean that it will take me round the world, at least if the offer 
of UNIX admin comes through for me I could find myself in very exotic 
places and would be good to have compatibility with that too....

I was thinking of going for something like the Hauppauge WinTV HVR 900 
HD-ready Stick but not sure what the support is or if it is able to do 
what I need from it?? Also being HD ready does this mean it can handle 
HD digital broadcasts??

I have heard good things about the WinTV Nova card again from Hauppauge 
but I think that is only digital TV not analog and won't achieve the 
results I'm looking for....
