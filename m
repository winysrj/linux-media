I've read about this a few days ago and, what I remember is it doesn't 
need a CAM. They made it like this so everyone in great-brittain could 
receive the BBC without a subscription. They didn't mind about it being 
received in other countries because the footprint of the satellite is so 
small.

However, I have read that you will only be able to get the digital 
tv-guide by using a freesat-licensed product, I believe that's what they 
mean when they talk about "freesat services"
