Detsamma, och det gör ingenting. :-)

If you have a different sub-device (and therefore async sub-device), I
guess that should work fine with just endpoint matching added.

You're still limited to a single media device though.

No. For that, I believe we'll need to somehow separate registering async
sub-devices and the notifier's bound callback. Perhaps async sub-devices
could be separated from the sub-device so that multiple async sub-devices
could be related to a single sub-device? And a list of bound and unbound
async sub-devices could be maintained in a sub-device.

Changes will be needed, that's for sure.

I'm not sure that'll need to be changed. We'll see. I'd start from allowing
more than one async sub-device per sub-device.

That should work for all current devices. If you need something else than
the default, then the driver must assign the fwnode.
