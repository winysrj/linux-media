I have same device here - not working. Last time I tried it said 
something like 'demod enumeration failed' though I am not sure if my 
device is working at all. There have been some other reports too that 
says this device is not working.

Do you have Windows XP drivers? I think I could fix that device if I get 
my device working with Windows. And I only have XP...

Antti
