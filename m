Hi guys,

Any news on SAA7162? I know this is asked fairly often but it's been a
couple of months since the last update. I did read that NXP are trying
to gauge the amount of user interest. Well here is one Linux user who
would buy such a card very soon if a working driver became available. I
am also pondering about DVB-S2/T2 but I guess DVB-S/T isn't going away
in the UK just yet. :)

James
