Agreed, dmabufmgr is meant for reserving multiple buffers without deadlocks.
The underlying mechanism for synchronization can be dma-fences, it wouldn't
really change dmabufmgr much.

Yeah, I managed to get nouveau hooked up with generating irqs on
completion today using an invalid command. It's also no longer a
performance regression, so software syncing is no longer a problem
for nouveau. i915 already generates irqs and r600 presumably too.

Monday I'll take a better look at your patch, end of day now. :)
