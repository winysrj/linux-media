There isn't much sense in having this discussion again (and kicking
off yet another flamewar).  All of your arguments have been made
before (and in the case of Linux DVB, they failed).  I would suggest
you read the archives and see how the developers arrived at their
conclusions.

If you have some *new* argument to offer, then feel free.  Otherwise
it's just flamebait.

Anyway, I've said what I have to say on this topic.

Cheers,

Devin
