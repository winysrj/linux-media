We have tested these patches to use dma fences to back the android
sync driver and not found any major issues.  However, my understanding
is that dma fences are designed for implicit sync, and explicit sync
through the android sync driver is bolted on the side to share code.
Android is not moving away from explicit sync, but we do wrap all of
our userspace sync accesses through libsync
(https://android.googlesource.com/platform/system/core/+/master/libsync/sync.c,
ignore the sw_sync parts), so if the kernel supported a slightly
different userspace explicit sync interface we could adapt to it
fairly easily.  All we require is that individual kernel drivers need
to be able to accept work alongisde an fd to wait on, and to return an
fd that will signal when the work is done, and that userspace has some
way to merge two of those fds, wait on an fd, and get some debugging
info from an fd.  However, this patch set doesn't do that, it has no
way to export a dma fence as an fd except through the android sync
driver, so it is not yet ready to fully replace android sync.
