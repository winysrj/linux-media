both of_property_read_u32 and of_node_put can handle port_node == NULL.
I'll add a WARN_ONCE here as for of_graph_get_next_endpoint and continue
on.

Yes, a check for the port_node name is in order.

I'd like to keep the iteration separate from parsing so we can
eventually introduce a for_each_endpoint_of_node helper macro around
of_graph_get_next_endpoint.

It depends a bit on whether you are actually iterating over individual
ports, or if you are just walking the whole endpoint graph to find
remote devices that have to be added to the component master's waiting
list, for example.

I started out to move an existing (albeit lightly used) API to a common
place so others can use it and improve upon it, too. I'm happy to pile
on fixes directly in this series, but could we separate the improvement
step from the move, for the bigger modifications?

I had no immediate use for the port iteration, so I have taken no steps
to add a function for this. I see no problem to add this later when
somebody needs it, or even rewrite of_graph_get_next_endpoint to use it
if it is feasible. Iterating over endpoints on a given port needs no
helper, as you can just use for_each_child_of_node.

of_graph_get_remote_port currently is used in the exynos4-is/fimc-is.c
v4l2 driver to get the mipi-csi channel id from the remote port, and
I've started using it in imx-drm-core.c for two cases:
- given an endpoint on the encoder, find the remote port connected to
  it, get the associated drm_crtc, to obtain its the drm_crtc_mask
  for encoder->possible_crtcs.
- given an encoder and a connected drm_crtc, walk all endpoints to find
  the remote port associated with the drm_crtc, and then use the local
  endpoint parent port to determine multiplexer settings.

I'm not sure about this. I might just need the remote port node
associated with a remote drm_crtc or drm_encoder structure to find out
which local endpoint I should look at to retrieve configuration.
