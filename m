It matter to the point that the binding author makes a decision about
how to represent the hardware. The driver architecture doesn't need to
match the binding layout, but it is nice when they line up.

Most of my questions are making sure I've got a full understanding. Even
if there are typical devices that have bidirectional interfaces I think
my decisions as a binding author would be the same. Given an arbitrary
graph of devices, I would still choose one place to describe a
connection. If it was a complex setup I may use a completely separate
node that collects all the element devices. On more straightforward
setups I would choose one of the devices as the 'master' and have it
describe the connections to other component devices.

In general I would recommend choosing whichever device you would
sensibly think of as a master. In the camera case I would choose the
camera controller node instead of the camera itself, and in the display
case I would choose the display controller instead of the panel. The
binding author needs to choose what she things makes the most sense, but
drivers can still use if it it turns out to be 'backwards'

It would help with schema validation and allow ports of the same
interface to get grouped together.

Sure. That's worth considering.
