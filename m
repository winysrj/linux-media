cm_alloc/free are definitely not meant to be called from device drivers.
They should be only considered as a backend for dma-mapping.

'Raw' contiguous memory block doesn't really make sense for the device
drivers. What the drivers require is a contiguous memory block that is
somehow mapped into respective bus address space, so dma-mapping 
framework is the right interface.

alloc_pages(..., GFP_CMA) looks nice but in fact it is really impractical.
The driver will need to map such buffer to dma context anyway, so imho
dma_alloc_attributed() will give the drivers much more flexibility. In
terms of dma-mapping the context argument isn't anything odd. 

If possible I would like to make cma something similar to 
declare_dma_coherent()&friends, so the board/platform/bus startup code
will just call declare_dma_contiguous() to enable support for cma for
particular devices.

Initialization part will be definitely simplified, I must confess that I
was in hurry to post the patches before the weekend and just forgot to
cleanup this part...

IMHO we can also use some NULL context to indicate some global, system 
wide CMA area and again -> in terms of dma-mapping api having a context 
isn't anything uncommon.

The problem is the fact that right now, we still have board files and we
have to live with them for a while (with all advantages and disadvantages).
I hope that you won't require me to rewrite the whole support for all ARM 
platforms to get rid of board files to get CMA merged ;)

I see no problem defining CMA areas in device tree, as this is something
really specific to particular board configuration.

I hope we will manage to get agreement :)
