Hi all,

I'm looking for a v4l-dvb developer who is at the Plumbers Conference to
attend the audio miniconference on Wednesday morning (see schedule here:
http://linuxplumbersconf.org/2009/schedule/) and to discuss ways of
synchronizing video and audio.

I won't have time for that myself, and I also know very little about alsa.
But this is an open topic that we need to do something about and this
conference is a good place for that.

Regards,

	Hans
