Hello,

I'm sorry for the late reply, I must have missed this mail...

I really don't get why you want to force the exporter to map the buffer into
clients dma address space. Only the client device might know all the quirks
required to do this correctly. Exporter should only provide a scatter-list 
with the memory that belongs to the exported buffer (might be pinned). How
do you want to solve the following case - the gpu hardware from your diagram
and a simple usb webcam with generic driver. The application would like to
export a buffer from the webcam to scanout engine. How the generic webcam 
driver might know HOW to set up the tiller to create correct mappings for 
the GPU/scanout? IMHO only a GPU driver is capable of doing that assuming
it got just a scatter list from the webcam driver.
