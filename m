I think that's debatable. :-) The specification doesn't say much what the
data_offset is really about. For instance, it does not specify what may be
in the buffer before data_offset.

The kerneldoc documentation next to struct v4l2_plane suggests there might
be a header, but that's primarily for driver developers rather than users.

I, for instance, understood data_offset to mean essentially how this set
"re-purposes" it. I wonder if there are others who have originally
understood it as such.

If you have a header before the image, the header probably has a format as
well. Some headers are device specific whereas some are more generic. The
SMIA standard, for example, does specify a metadata (header or footer!)
format.

It'd be useful to be able to tell the user what kind of header there is. For
that, the header could be located on a different plane, with a specific
format.

There's room for format information in struct v4l2_plane_pix_format but
hardly much else. It still would cover a number of potential use cases.

I might still consider making the planes independent of each other;
conveniently there's 8 bytes of free space in struct v4l2_pix_format_mplane
for alternative plane related information. It'd be nice to be able to do
this without an additional buffer type since that's visible in a large
number of other places: there's plenty of room in struct v4l2_plane for
any video buffer related information.

Frame descriptors are not needed for this --- you're quite right in that.
But the frame descriptors, when implemented, will very probably need plane
specific formats in the end as not many receivers are able to separate
different parts of the image to different buffers.

I said I ok with adding buf_offset field, but it might not be the best
choice we can make: it's a temporary solution for a very specific problem,
leaves the API with similar field names with different meanings (data_offset
vs. buf_offset, where the other is about the header and the other about the
data) and is not extensible. In addition, the size of the header is not
specified; it might be smaller than what's between buf_offset and
data_offset. Some devices produce footers as well; currently we have no way
to specify how they are dealt with.

I'd like to at least investigate if we could have something more
future-proof for this purpose.
