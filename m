Hi,

A number of user repositories on linuxtv.org haven't
been updated for years:

http://linuxtv.org/hg?sort=-lastchange

I suspect that most of them have become totally irrelevant
and just clutter up the repository list, making it less
user friendly, and using up disk space. Probably the changes
they contain have been merged long ago and the user just forgot
to delete the repo?


Can somebody tell me please why I shouldn't go and
just delete all repositories which haven't been touched
in the last 12 months?  IOW, unless I hear otherwise,
I'm going to delete the cruft after Sep. 1.


Thanks,
Johannes
