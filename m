Just wanted to add, in previous driver version 2.13.0 Auto Gain was 
switchable ON / OFF, but when switched ON, was activated all the time regardless 
of lighting conditions, resulting in overexposed images during a day light with 
only silhouettes visible. But in current version its impossible to switch Auto 
Gain 
ON, or its default settings are wrong so it just doesn't work at all.

There are long term and current driver maintainers frequent here, pls fix the 
issue. :)
