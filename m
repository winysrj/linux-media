One of the differences between the old ->ioctl() and the ->unlocked_ioctl()
function is that unlocked_ioctl could point to the same function as
->compat_ioctl(), so we have to catch functions returning -ENOIOCTLCMD.

ENOIOCTLCMD should never be returned to user space, see the comment
in include/linux/errno.h:

/*
 * These should never be seen by user programs.  To return one of ERESTART*
 * codes, signal_pending() MUST be set.  Note that ptrace can observe these
 * at syscall exit tracing, but they will never be left for the debugged user
 * process to see.
 */

There was a lot of debate whether undefined ioctls on non-ttys should
return -EINVAL or -ENOTTY, including mass-conversions from -ENOTTY to
-EINVAL at some point in the pre-git era, IIRC.

Inside of v4l2, I believe this is handled by video_usercopy(), which
turns the driver's -ENOIOCTLCMD into -ENOTTY. What cases do you observe
where this is not done correctly and we do return ENOIOCTLCMD to
vfs_ioctl?

Note that 1da177e is the initial commit to git, Linus did not write that
code, although he might have an opinion.
