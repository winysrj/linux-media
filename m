I somehow agree, but I believe for this to work we need to offer applications 
with a way to find out about the constraints associated with the shared tuner. 
We can't expect userspace to properly deal with errors if they can't find out 
from information exposed by the kernel how to deal with them. From an end-user 
point of view, a dialog box saying EBUSY is pretty much useless if we can't 
tell the user that they can't watch TV on their XYZ DVB device because the 
radio device ABC is currently in use.
