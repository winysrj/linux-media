Hi all,

I know anything about this driver. I'm still ready to maintain this, in
fact I'm doing this for years.
Why do you look for another maintainer instead of supporting my pull
request? In the long lasting discussion about this there was not a
single technical reason why this driver cannot be merged as is,
especially in staging as first step to do the required cleanup.

Regards,
Soeren
