I'm not much familiar with MythTV, so I'm guessing from the mux setup changes,
but did you check to descramble the same channel on different tuners?
To eliminate
the particular change inside one service only.

Of course there can be also software issue in CI-CAM module itself
(fail in parsing
PMT CA descriptors etc).

TBH, I think it must be application layer issue, not kernel one.
