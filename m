I think Laurent had a similar issue in his Aptina sensor driver. In my
opinion we need a class for low level controls such as the gain ones. Do I
understand correctly they control the red and blue pixel gain in the sensor
pixel matrix? Do you also have gain controls for the two greens?

In my opinion V4L2_CID_COLORFX should never be implemented in drivers for
which the hardware doesn't implement these effects in a non-parametrisable
way. This control was originally added for the OMAP 3 ISP driver but the
driver never implemented it.

I think you have a valid case using this control. I think the main
difference between the two is that V4L2_COLORFX_BW is something that you
can't use with other effects while V4L2_CID_COLOR_KILLER can be used with
any of the effects.

Based on your original proposal the black/white should stay as a separate
control but the solarise should be configurable through V4L2_CID_COLORFX
menu control. So it boils down to the question whether you can use them at
the same time.
