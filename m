Hi,

I'm going through mail backlash again.

Arrgh, what a not aware of anything major BS.

Either you have the not yet public driver details, than you can write
wrappers, please then do so.

Not the preferred solution.

Or you ask people still hacking on some stuff, why the damned hell some
those idiots still try to hack it ...

Patches are welcome.

Cheers,
Hermann
