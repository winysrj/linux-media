You should use regulator_full_constraints() if your board has a fully
described set of regulators.  This will cause the framework to power
down any regulators which aren't in use after init has completed.  If
you have some regulators with no consumers or missing consumers you need
to mark them as always_on in their constraints.

This would cause lots of breakage, it would mean that all regulators
that aren't always_on would get bounced off at least once during startup
- that's not going to be great for things like the backlight.
