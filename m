But what if you don't know who allocated the buffer?  How do you know
what interface to use to mmap?

Well, things like stride, width, height, color format, userspace needs
to know all this already, even for malloc()'d sw buffers.  The
assumption is userspace already has a way to pass this information
around so it was not required to be duplicated by dmabuf.

But then we'd need a different set of accessors for every different
drm/v4l/etc driver, wouldn't we?

I'm not entirely sure the case you are worried about.. sharing buffers
between multiple GPU's that understand same tiled formats?  I guess
that is a bit different from a case like a jpeg encoder that is passed
a dmabuf handle without any idea where it came from..

I guess if sharing a buffer between multiple drm devices, there is
nothing stopping you from having some NOT_DMABUF_MMAPABLE flag you
pass when the buffer is allocated, then you don't have to support
dmabuf->mmap(), and instead mmap via device and use some sort of
DRM_CPU_PREP/FINI ioctls for synchronization..
