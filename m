Subject: [Bug 229879] Re: My DVB-card is flooding the consol with "recv bulk
message failed"
To: oobe.trouble@gmail.com


as mentioned im using 2.6.27-11-generic and as i said i havent had a
problem yet well the other day i did i experienced the same problems
that others here report including spam console etc. but i have not had
it before or since just chiming in to say that even when i have somthing
that i consider stable it still ends up like this on occasion so there
is yet to be a completely stable kernel or v4l-dvb tree on this matter.


 it would be sensable if someone started a thread on the v4l-dvb mailing
list about this  as ubuntu developers cannot fix this due to the fact
they only package the code that v4l-dvb produce which intern goes into
the kernel which distros then patch and package.

"I also have this issue. I was originally running 7.10, then upgraded to
8.10 via 8.04. I think the suggestion from Kemble to post to the v4l-dvb
mailing list is sound. If the OP can create an initial posting I'll also
post to the same thread to highlight that this is affecting multiple
users.
