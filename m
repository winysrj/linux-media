Did you mean: 'tuner token is issued' instead of audio token?

I also have the same question as Takashi: why do we have an audio
token in the first place? While you are streaming audio over alsa
the underlying tuner must be marked as being in use. It's all about
the tuner, since that's the resource that is being shared, not about
audio as such.

For the remainder of my review I will ignore the audio-related code
and concentrate only on the tuner part.

I am still not convinced myself that this should be a generic API.
The only reason we need it today is for sharing tuners. Which is almost
a purely media thing with USB audio as the single non-media driver that
will be affected. Today I see no use case outside of tuners. I would
probably want to keep this inside drivers/media.

If this is going to be expanded it can always be moved to lib later.

dev_dbg would be more appropriate.

Ditto.

As I understand it this makes no sense: if tkn->task == current,
then tkn->tgid == tgid.

Why would you allow different task in the same group id to release anyway?

OK, this makes no sense. I am completely missing the tuner mode here.
Speaking for V4L2 (I am less sure about DVB) any application can access
the tuner even if it is owned by another application as long as you don't
switch mode.

The way it works now it would block any other application from accessing
the tuner, or even other threads in the same process group. That's pretty
much guaranteed to break existing code.

So these tokens should be refcounted (certainly for the analog tuner mode,
but probably for all modes). In the V4L2 wrapper function you just check
if the token has been obtained already by setting a flag in struct v4l2_fh.
If not, then you get the token.

When the file handle is released and if it has the token, then you release
that token.

It is my understanding (correct me if I am wrong) that DVB and ALSA allow
only one user of the interface at a time, so you can still use refcounting
there, but the refcount will never go above 1 anyway.

I just hacked tknres support into vivid to test this and it really disables
this important feature.

I also discovered that you are missing MODULE_AUTHOR, MODULE_DESCRIPTION
and above all MODULE_LICENSE. Without the MODULE_LICENSE it won't link this
module to the GPL devres_* functions. It took me some time to figure that
out.

I'm really sorry but I have to nack this patch series. It simply breaks
existing V4L functionality that I know people are using.

I'm not going to review the other patches, they seemed mostly OK to me
although I would expect to see changes to videobuf2-core.c as well which
I didn't.

You might want to think about adding media token support to vivid to test
this. The vivid driver supports both radio and TV tuners. Currently those
are emulated as independent tuners, but you could try to use media token
to emulate it as a shared resource. That way you can test this with a vb2
driver as well.
