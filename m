Dear Friend,

Greetings and hope this mail meets you well!

I want you to be my partner in the transfer of the sum of $12.7
Million dollars discovered in my department in one of the leading
Banks (EcoBank Plc) here in Burkina-Faso. I shall give you more
informations on this proposal when I get your reply, but be rest
assured that I will give you 40% of the total sum once the transfer is
completed but you have to
maintain secrecy of this deal if you are ready to work with me.

God bless you as I wait for your response.

Dr. Kabore Wilfred
