Hi, what is the procedure to request drivers for specific new, perhaps
unknown supported cards?

I did have a look at http://www.linuxtv.org/wiki/index.php/Main_Page
but it didn't contain any information about supported cards. Neither
did 2.6.30 /usr/src/linux/Documentation/dvb/cards.txt for the
following brands:

name, site:
Compro, S300 http://www.comprousa.com/en/product/s300/s300.html
K-World VS-DVB-S 100/IS,
http://global.kworld-global.com/main/prod_in.aspx?mnuid=1248&modid=6&pcid=46&ifid=16&prodid=98

Perhaps I shouldn't waste time if I could find a dual/twin tuner card
for dvb-s or dvb-s2. Are there any recommended twin-tuner pci-e cards
that is support and can actually be bought by the average consumer?

Thanks
