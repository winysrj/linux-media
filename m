Wow, interesting offer from this guy! Hopefully this is a motivation for Olli. Maybe I also can offer beer or sth. else or help to test a new version of the driver.

With single tuner support it works great since june 24/7 (except my last upgrade of the rpi with mismatched modules...)

Cheers,
Patrick

have you seen http://www.spinics.net/lists/linux-media/msg105939.html?
The guy is offering USD$200 for working dual tuner support of the ATSC version. The ATSC version has different tuners, but maybe it is no big deal. Would that be a little motivation for you? Or what could motivate you? Do you like German beer? ;-)

Dual tuner support would be awesome. The device is perfect for building a low-power VDR client or streaming server using a Raspberry Pi/Banana Pi.

Best,
Christian
