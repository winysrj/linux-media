Note that you can completely skip the step of a v4l2-dev global mutex with
Frederic's patch. This is the only use of the BKL in the common v4l2
code as far as I can tell, so instead of introducing yet another global
lock, you can go straight to stage 4 and look at each driver separately,
possibly introducing a per driver lock.
