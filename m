Did you receive my email yesterday?

Just want to check if you have needs for photo editing for our studio?
We normally edit 300 images within 12-24 hours.

We take care of different kinds of e-commerce photos, jewelry images, and
portrait model images.

Including cutting out and clipping path and others, we also give retouching
for your images.

You may drop us a photo if you want to check our quality, we will provide
testing.

Thanks,
Roy
