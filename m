Hello all.

I have an Avermedia Volar HD Pro (A835). Since 2 month ago I was
searching info and news about the support of this device on Linux and
now I found a spanish forum[0] that seems to explain how you can get
this device working. I will try it with my AverTV, but my device its
the Pro model and have the following ID:
ID 07ca:a835 AVerMedia Technologies, Inc.

Someone had tried to get working this device? I will try this and I
will explain soon my experience if i get succesfully working my
avermedia.
