Yes. The driver supports DM6446. We will add the Dm6446x patches on these.

The application is responsible for filling this info. He would enumerate the
capabilities first and  set them using S_PARAM/G_PARAM.

There are a lot of tiny modules in the previewer/resizer which are enumerated 
as individual modules. The param points to the parameter set that the module
expects to be set.

It could be integer. It is generally a fixed point num, and easy to read it
as a string than an integer. Can I keep it as a string?

Config is setting which is required for a subdev to function based on what it is
set for (single shot/continuous.) common to all platforms. Parameters are the
settings for individual small sub-ips which might be slightly different from one
platform to another. Config points to prev_single_shot_config or  prev_continuous_config
currently defined in linux/dm3656ipipe.h. I think we will move it to a common location.

The number of these sub-Ips are quite a few in DM365 and Dm355, having a lot of them 
In a way that may be bewildering to the end-user to be able to connect them quickly and properly.
But overall, these are nothing but exposed subips of what we call as CCDC,Previewer  and Resizer.It
Made a lot of logical sense to keep it that way, give a default configuration for everything, and if
at all the user wants the fine grain config control, be able to give (mainly for the configurations- 
not so much for connections). In most of the cases the param IOTCLs are only used for fine-tuning the image and not expected to be used as a regular flow of a normal application. I do not think there could be any justification for making all these nitty gritty which keep changing for each IPs as part of regular V4L2 IOCTLs. In future, if there is a common theme that emerges, we could definitely relook into this.

Config points to rsz_single_shot_config and rsz_continuous_config defined in dm365ipipe.h As mentioned earlier, we could move the definition to a common header. 
The chain param is to indicate if resizer and previewer are chained. We will remove this.

In that case only gain has to be taken out as a generic IOCTL. Since that is is

Do you want to define new MBUS formats for these?

 Sure we can take it up sometime later.

Yes, we can discuss about it to make it common. I would prefer we get this driver in and make amends when you are doing it for OMAP.
