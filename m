Hi,
I've an adapter with USB ID 15a4:9016, with an AF9015 and tuner 
TDA18218. This is the fifth adatper that I try, 3 currently work, one 
should work, but I've no success, and this not work.
I've seen in previous posts that it is not supported for now, but many 
people have done some experiment and some have obtained something, but 
nothing of full working.
I want to know if it's possible to write a working driver using 
datasheet and starting from the code of TDA18271 using the difference 
from datasheet (at a first look they seems very similar); I'm not a 
programmer, but I'm able to do some logic operation if someone can 
explain me what I must do.
I can do tester and report log of usbsnnop too, but starting from it and 
write a driver is too hard for me.
If someone with this adapter want to try some experiment with me and 
work on it, I'm available to cowork.

Thanks to all,
Sebastian
