[Hiremath, Vaibhav] I am not referring to application here, there is no doubt that application must support non-MC devices. 
I should be able to use standard V4L2 streaming application and use it on streaming device node, the only change would be, for MC aware device, links need to be set before and for non-MC aware devices its default thing.

[Hiremath, Vaibhav] Agreed. That's what I thought.

[Hiremath, Vaibhav] Let me digest this.
