Exactly.

I think it should be safe. In any case we cannot rely on the fact, that 
free_irq() in the current code happens "soon" after pxa_free_dma(), so, 
putting it even later will either emphasise our certainty, that we're safe 
there, or help up catch the bug, since statistically the window will 
become larger;-) Of course, all of clk_get(), request_mem_region() + 
ioremap(), kzalloc(), request_irq() would have to be replaced.

Thanks
