As discussed on our IRC #v4l channels and on the media ML, most of the 
core developers will be again this year in San Jose - CA - USA for the
Embedded Linux Conference.

There are several subjects that we've been discussing those days that
require a face to face meeting.

So, We'll be doing a media mini-summit on March, 26 (Thursday) at the 
Marriott San Jose.

This time, Linux Foundation will be handling the subscriptions
for the event, via their registering site:
	https://www.regonline.com/register/login.aspx?eventID=1623927&MethodId=0&EventsessionId=

So, you need to register for an "add-on" option as shown below:

I hope to see you there!

Ah, as usual, we'll be using the media-workshop@linuxtv.org ML for
specific discussions about that, so the ones interested on participate
are requested to subscribe it, and to submit themes of interest to
the mailing lists.

Regards!
