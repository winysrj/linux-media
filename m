Hello Josh,

Good.

Doing the YUV -> RGB within the V4L2 driver is something I understand
quite well. The part I miss is how the V4L2 driver interacts with the
framebuffer driver to output the camera image into the framebuffer.

> For V4L2_CAP_VIDEO_OVERLAY type driver, I don't know much about that.

Hum, ok, found http://v4l2spec.bytesex.org/spec/x6570.htm which seems
to explain a bit the userspace interface for this.

Thanks for your feedback!
