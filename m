Well, I'm no fs guy but this should still go through the buffer cache. I
think the O_SYNC flag makes sure it all lands on the partition in time.
Oh well, it doesn't matter.

If you wrote that and you're not a programmer, it certainly looks cool,
good job!.

 [ Btw, don't forget to free(buffer) at the end. ]

Also, there was a patchset recently which added a blockconsole method to
the kernel with which you can do something like that in a generic way.

Back to the issue at hand: it looks like ehci_hcd is causing some list
corruptions, maybe coming from the uvcvideo or whatever. I think the usb
people will have a better idea.

Btw, is there any particular reason you're running a 32-bit kernel?

Thanks.
