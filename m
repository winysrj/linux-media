can we have some boolean property in the DT file then instead of hardcoding this in the driver.

We need to move everything from ti_wilink_st.h that is used in hci_ll.c into that file.

This is really a custom protocol (even if it kinda modeled after HCI commands/events) and it be really better the core allows to register skb_pkt_type() vendor channels so it just feeds this back into the driver. We need a bit of btmon mapping for this, but that shouldnâ€™t be that hard.

We do have a GNSS subsystem now and could just as easily hook this up.
