Isn't disabling Speculative Accesses forwarding to the AXI bus the
solution to our woes?
At least on the A8, which happens to be paired with non-IOMMU capable
IPs on our SoCs.
On A9 the bit is gone (or has it moved?), but we have IOMMU here so the
CMA isn't needed.

3.2.26. c1, Auxiliary Control Register
CP15, c1, c0, bit 4: Enables speculative accesses on AXI
