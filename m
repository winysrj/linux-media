Hi,

I google and find the presentation for Generic V4L2 Andriod camera
HAL, in there it said

* "A VEU mem2mem driver has been written to convert YUV camera output
to a 16-bit RGB format"
and
* "A test program from Sylwester has been xed and extended."

Can you please tell me where I can find the test program from Sylwester?

Thank you.
Mike
