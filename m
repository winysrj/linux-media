I just bought a DViCO FusionHDTV7 Dual Express and I was able to get
it working after downloading and install the firmware (
http://linuxtv.org/wiki/index.php/DViCO_FusionHDTV7_Dual_Express#Firmware
), but my question is could that firmware be added to a distribution
(like Mythbuntu 9.04) so it could work out of the box? Or are there
legal/technical reasons that prevent that?
Thanks,
Dave
