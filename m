This is a bit verbose, and if your output port is on an encoder device
with multiple inputs, the correct port number would become a bit
unintuitive. For example, we'd have to use port@4 as the output encoder
units that have a 4-port input multiplexer and port@1 for those that
don't.

What is supplied by this regulator. Is it the PHY?

I have a usecase for this the other way around. The i.MX6 DISP0 parallel
display pads can be connected to two different display controllers via
multiplexers in the pin control block.

parallel-display {
	compatible = "fsl,imx-parallel-display";
	#address-cells = <1>;
	#size-cells = <0>;

	port@0 {
		endpoint {
			remote-endpoint = <&ipu1_di0>;
		};
	};

	port@1 {
		endpoint {
			remote-endpoint = <&ipu2_di0>;
		};
	};

	disp0: port@2 {
		endpoint {
			pinctrl-names = "0", "1";
			pinctrl-0 = <&pinctrl_disp0_ipu1>;
			pinctrl-1 = <&pinctrl_disp0_ipu2>;
			remote-endpoint = <&lcd_in>;
		};
	}
};

Here, depending on the active input port, the corresponding pin control
on the output port could be set. This is probably quite driver specific,
so I don't see yet how the framework should help with this. In any case,
maybe this is a bit out of scope for the generic graph bindings.

Philipp
