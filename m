Actually, thinking some more about this, you should make the tvp514x driver 
depend on CONFIG_MEDIA_CONTROLLER unconditionally. This doesn't mean that the 
driver will become unusable by applications that are not MC-aware. 
Hosts/bridges don't have to export subdev nodes, they can just call subdev 
pad-level operations internally and let applications control the whole device 
through a single V4L2 video node.

The AM35x driver should use the in-kernel MC and V4L2 subdev APIs, but it 
doesn't have to expose them to userspace.
