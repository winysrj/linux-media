1080p@30fps is indeed a functional requirement, as the IP has the 
capability to achieve it. This IP itself can act as more than one AXI 
master, and control more than one memory port(bank). So this is not a 
*performance hack*

Also, if I recall, during the Budapest discussion (I was on irc), I 
recall that this requirement can become the information available to the 
actual allocator. Below is the summary point I could collect from summit 
notes:

     * May also need to specify more attributes (specific physical 
memory region)

As per this point, the requirement (as above) must be attribute to the 
allocator, which is CMA in this case.
