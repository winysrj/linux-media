This patch is independent of the other stuff. I don't see a good reason
to revert it.

I'm keeping most of the patches for ds3000 in hold, as this driver should
be broken into two separate drivers. I provided already a feedback on
the patch series that splits this driver. So, I'm waiting for his new
patchset. Only after that change, I'll be handling other patches for ds3000,
as it will make easier to review and understand this driver.

Wouldn't be better then to add it at the boards configuration, instead of
using a modprobe parameter?
