I think I am :-).

Ok, I took a look, and "iout" is notation I understand, but people may
have trouble with and I don't see it used anywhere else.

Also... do we need both "current" and "max-current" properties?

But regulators already have "regulator-max-microamp" property. So what
about:

max-microamp : 	maximum intensity in microamperes of the LED
 		  	(torch LED for flash devices)
max-flash-microamp : 	initial intensity in microamperes of the
 			flash LED; it is required to enable support
 			for the flash led
flash-timeout-microseconds : timeout in microseconds after which flash
 			led is turned off

If you had indicator on the same led, I guess

indicator-microamp : recommended intensity in microamperes of the LED
		         for indication

...would do?

Agreed.
