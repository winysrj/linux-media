I think we are talking about the same thing. A region like dma=40MB would be
shared by all drivers that want to allocate from it.

That's what I expected as well.

I strongly recommend that it is simple dropped from the first version. That
will increase the chances of getting it merged. And once merged, interfaces
like this can be discussed at leisure.

Agreed. But this is platform code, you should not have to pass this info
through boot args.

I agree with that as long as the extra code needed to do so it within limits.
I've seen too often that people design for a future that never happens. That
leads to code that is never used and will make it hard to future generations
of developers to figure out what the purpose was of that code.

Right. It might be an option that they do reserve a minimal amount of memory.
If you know that you always need at least X MB of memory to get the system
running, then that might be useful.

Right.

Right.

Not quite sure I understand the problem here. Isn't that something for the driver to
decide? If it can only work with buffers from banka, then it will just fail if it
cannot allocate the required buffers. On the other hand, if it can also work with
buffers from bankb if banka is full, then it can just use bankb as fallback.

This type of behavior is very much driver specific and as such should be done by
the driver and not through user supplied kernel parameters IMHO.

First of all, any driver that needs specific memory banks is highly platform
specific and is extremely unlikely to work anywhere else.

But this can also handled in the driver itself. Either through config #ifdefs or
by using e.g. a dma region as fallback.

Sorry, I don't understand the question. I think I would refer to my answer to the
previous question, but I'm not sure if that covers this.

That's actually a good point. I can imagine this.

I would not implement this for a first version. But one way this could be done is
by something like this:

dma/foo(kind)=20MB where '(kind)' is optional. The big problem I have with this
is that this means that you need to know what 'kinds' of memory a particular
driver needs.

This can always be added later. For an initial release I wouldn't do this.

A region is very similar to the last argument to kmalloc. And drivers most definitely
need to know about regions, just like they need to specify the correct GFP flags.

In fact, it's the only thing that need to know.

I think so, yes. The disadvantage of the CMA solution is that if you have a number
of drivers, each with their own kinds of memory, you get very complex mappings. And
remember that these drivers are not limited to the hardware inside the SoC, but can
also include e.g. USB drivers. You can't predict what USB device the end user will
connect to the device, so you would have to be able to handle any mapping that any
USB driver might need.

I really think this is the wrong approach.
