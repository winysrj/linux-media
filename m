I agree that we need to find the real cause; however, I am not the one with the 
problem, and I do not have the hardware. In addition, I am not sure how much 
additional debug information the person will be able to provide. He has not 
built Linux kernels since 1.2. If he can get a kernel built, then we will try to 
find the real cause.

In any case, why the reluctance to get rid of the BUG_ON? Is this condition so 
severe that the kernel needs to be stopped immediately?
