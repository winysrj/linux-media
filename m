Hi All,

I was wondering if someone could recommend a decent DVB-C tuner card?
Ideally it would be a dual DVB-C card, but I'm not sure they exist?!

I have a subscription to a PayTV provider here in Australia that uses an 
encryption scheme called NDS or Videoguard2.
So I'll also need the right card reader and combo of software in order 
to decrypt and then capture.

This stuff I can mostly work out for myself.....
But if you have any knowledge or experience in that area, then I'd be 
most appreciative if you can share.
As it definitely isn't for technical minnows!

Oh and in case you're worried, doing this sort of thing is not -yet- 
illegal in Australia.
It may be soon though, thanks to the FTA our former Prime Minister 
established with the U.S.

All the best,
Jed
