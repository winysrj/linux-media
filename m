the OP wants analog to work on this device
developers (certainly in the USA) have no incentive to work on that as 
they have gone digital
i personally cannot help with that device

as for Marcus's stuff not being open source - well then what has it got 
to do with this mailing list?
anyway, it used to be open source - but he went off in a sulk because 
people would not do things "the one true way" as he saw it

perhaps if you were to reread some of the old email threads you would 
realise that you have not quite grasped the whole situation
