I'll need to check, might have been my fault too, since I was trying to 
reallocate the frames segment to implement support for CREATE_BUFS, 
without proper knowledge of the code. If we could have 1 allocation per 
frame, it would be trivial to implement. Could be made as a rework 
first. I wouldn't not worry too much for now, I apology for the noise.

Thanks for this information, and thanks for the effort so far. I didn't 
want to make this comment discouraging. I do cheer anyone taking care 
right now, and anyone that would come up next. As you mention, there has 
been plan (and currently active work) toward depending on libv4l to 
support cameras that need media-controller, decoders that need parsers, 
etc. I think these ideas are fine, but when bringing these ideas we 
should care more of how we are doing to add and test these in libv4l2, 
in a way that it's all very usable.

cheers,
Nicolas
