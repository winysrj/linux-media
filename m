Seeing other message about a problem with the same card, made me think
I forgot to post my conclusion.

I downgraded to 3.6.5 which was a working one at the time I got the
card and the problem is the same. The problem is thus elsewhere (maybe
hardware related but it is difficult to me to test the card in another
computer).
