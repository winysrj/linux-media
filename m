Ok, please add such explanations at the patch's descriptions, as it is
important not only for me, but to others that may need to use it..

The basic reason for having more than one VB low-level handling (vb2 was
inspired on this concept) is that some DMA APIs are very different than
the other ones (see vmalloc x DMA S/G for example).

I didn't make a diff between videobuf2-dma-streaming and videobuf2-dma-contig,
so I can't tell if it makes sense to merge them or not, but the above
argument seems too weak. I was expecting for a technical reason why
it wouldn't make sense for merging them.

I see. It doesn't hurt to add a short explanation then at the patch description,
pointing to Documentation/DMA-API-HOWTO.txt, describing when using it instead
of vb2-dma-config (or vb2-dma-sg) would likely give better performance results,
and when the reverse is true.

Btw, from Documentation/DMA-API-HOWTO.txt:

   "Good examples of what to use streaming mappings for are:

	- Networking buffers transmitted/received by a device.
	- Filesystem buffers written/read by a SCSI device.

    The interfaces for using this type of mapping were designed in
    such a way that an implementation can make whatever performance
    optimizations the hardware allows.  To this end, when using
    such mappings you must be explicit about what you want to happen."

I'm not a DMA performance expert. As such, from that comment, it sounded to me
that replacing dma-config/dma-sg by dma streaming will always give "performance
optimizations the hardware allow".

If this is always true, why to preserve the old vb2-dma-config/vb2-dma-sg?

In other words, I suspect that the above is just half of the history ;)

On a separate but related issue, while doing DMABUF tests with an Exynos4
hardware, using a s5p sensor, sending data to s5p-tv, I noticed a CPU
consumption of about 42%, which seems too high. Could it be related to
not using the DMA streaming API?
