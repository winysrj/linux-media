Ah, I didn't know that. In such case, your suggestion is indeed better,
as it is easier to write the patch.

No, because the main functionality (webcam support) doesn't depend on
INPUT.

Yeah, but the thing is that it breaks at compilation time, because
the builtin module would try to use some symbols that are defined only
at runtime.

So, the above won't solve the issue.

One possibility for future Kernels would be to add some logic that would
automatically load the module if a call to one of those symbols defined
inside a module happens inside a builtin module.

The DVB subsystem actually does that for I2C frontend drivers, 
using those macros:

#define dvb_attach(FUNCTION, ARGS...) ({ \
	void *__r = NULL; \
	typeof(&FUNCTION) __a = symbol_request(FUNCTION); \
	if (__a) { \
		__r = (void *) __a(ARGS); \
		if (__r == NULL) \
			symbol_put(FUNCTION); \
	} else { \
		printk(KERN_ERR "DVB: Unable to find symbol "#FUNCTION"()\n"); \
	} \
	__r; \
})

#define dvb_detach(FUNC)	symbol_put_addr(FUNC)

The above works reasonably fine when there's just one symbol needed
from the module driver.

There are, however, some issues with such approach:

1) as symbol_request increments refcount, this works very badly when
   there's more than one symbol needed, as symbol_put() would need
   to be called as many times as symbol_request() is called;

2) lsmod doesn't list what module is actually requesting such symbol
   (if the caller is also a module). It just increments refcounting.
    There were some patches meant to fix that, send a long time ago,
    but were never merged. Can't remember why:
	http://linuxtv.org/pipermail/linux-dvb/2006-August/012322.html

Due to the above issues, and because we want to better use the I2C
binding model, we're currently trying to get rid of such approach for
the DVB subsystem, but there are too many changes to get rid of it.
So, the migration is slow.

Anyway, IMHO, having such sort of logic would help to solve the issues
with some weird configs like INPUT=m.

Mauro
