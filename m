Hello Steffen,

The patch itself looks valid. If you could submit it in a formally
correct format it could probably be added to the linux-media tree for
other people's enjoyment as well. Have a look at points 2, 6, 10 and
11 in the following link:
https://www.kernel.org/doc/Documentation/SubmittingPatches

Cheers,
-olli
