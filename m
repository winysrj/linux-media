Ok. Let's add it them.

Yes, that's make sense for me. As easycap is a new driver, there's no
regression on adding a patch like that, even after the merge window,
especially since input selection is typically a trivial change that
won't cause bad effects.

Please send the patch. I'll likely submit it upstream by next week,
after giving some time for people to test it via the media tree.
