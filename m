Well, the FAQ for the 1800 doesn't say it's supported so much but
rather says that you can use it with Linux.  In the case of both the
1800 and the 1850, this means the digital support only.

Hauppauge doesn't officially support any of the cards, but they do
make an effort to point people to the LinuxTV wiki for cards that have
some level of support.
