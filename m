Yeah, there are many changes there that justifies adding you at its
authorship, and that's ok. Also, anyone saying the size of your patch
will recognize your and ST efforts to improve the driver.

However, as some parts of the code were preserved, dropping the old
authors doesn't sound right (and can even be illegal, in the light
of the GPL license). It would be ok, though, if you would be
changing it to something like:

	Copyright (c) 2010 by ...
or
	Original driver from ...

or some other similar wording that would preserve their names
there. We do that even when something is rewritten, like, for
example, drivers/media/v4l2-core/videobuf-core.c:

  * (c) 2007 Mauro Carvalho Chehab, <mchehab@infradead.org>
  *
  * Highly based on video-buf written originally by:

The same reason why you didn't drop windriver's copyright also applies here:
while most of the code changed, there are still a few things left from the
original driver.

The only way of not preserving the original authors here were if you
start from scratch, without looking at the original code (and you can
somehow, be able to proof it), otherwise, the code will be fit as a
"derivative work", in the light of GPL, and should be preserving the
original authorship.

Something started from scratch like that will hardly be accepted upstream,
as regressions will likely be introduced, and previously supported
hardware/features may be lost in the process.

Of course the original author can abdicate to his rights of keeping his
name on it. Yet, even if he opt/accept to not keep his name explicitly
there, his copyrights are preserved, with the help of the git history.

That's said, no single kernel developer/company has full copyrights on
any part of the Kernel, as their code are based on someone else's work.
For example, all Kernel drivers depend on drivers/base, with in turn,
depends on memory management, generic helper functions, arch code, etc.

So, IMHO, there's not much point on dropping authorship messages.

Mauro
