Yes, and this is currently provided. The dmesg will show the last 3 git commits.
A developer can just use git diff or git log to discover what changed since those
commits.

Perhaps, but the cost to maintain the out-of-tree driver git tree is cheap. We provide
just a small building system, with a script that downloads a daily tarball
with just drivers/media and the corresponding includes (and a few drivers/staging).
The building system has a couple patches to allow backport compilation since 2.6.32.
