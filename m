I currently don't have time to work on it and Luk치코' time is also
limited.

We stay in contact and I can provide a device not yet working for me to
him, if he wants. I'll keep you posted. You can have one too ;)

Currently the hardware reset in saa7134-dvb.c seems to break tda8275a
hybrid tuners on my saa7131e devices for DVB-T. This is not restricted
to the devices with multiple frontends, but also hits such with single
frontend only. The TRIO has two tda8275a, they are not in use as hybrid
tuners and don't need extra initialization again, that might be the
difference.

We should avoid such saa7133 hardware reset on those cards not needing
it in any case, means all with single frontend.

ON DVB-S is also a regression visible, in one of two cases needs a
second tuning attempt now and it also seems to be related to the
hardware reset, since without works fine like previously.

Patch is not ready yet for inclusion.

Cheers,
Hermann
