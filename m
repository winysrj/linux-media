Hello Roshan,

Please address future correspondence to the linux-media mailing list,
as linux-dvb has been deprecated.

Regarding dib0700 analog, there were only three people who showed any
interest when I put out a call for people who wanted the
functionality.  Given other projects I am working on (and their much
larger installed base), I couldn't justify the several weeks of
development that would be required.

Sorry I don't have better news.

Devin
