Not quite.  You'll notice that drivers/dma/omap-dma.c appears in that
list.  That is because right now, the new code has to co-operate with
the old legacy code to ensure that both do not try and operate on the
same hardware channel simultaneously.

Right now, when anyone tries to use any of the drivers using the legacy
APIs, they will get a warning printed in their kernel message log.  This
is part of my attempt to try and find out:

(a) whether anyone is using these drivers
(b) whether we can delete these drivers

That warning has not been in the kernel long enough to be certain of
anything - it was merged during the last merge window (despite me
having it ready to go since the previous merge window, it would not
have been correct to introduce a new warning during the -rc period.)

What I recommend is that you just don't mark the OMAP drivers for
compile testing right now, especially as their future is rather
uncertain.
