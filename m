At this moment it seems nothing more then that but they way I see it
is that with a common, standardised, centrally-managed mechanism for
grabbing memory we can start thinking about the ways to reuse the memory.

If each driver were to grab it's own memory in a way know to itself only
the memory is truly lost but with CMA not only regions can be reused among
devices but also the framework can manage the unallocated memory and try to
utilize it in other ways (movable pages? cache? buffers? some kind of
compressed memory swap?).

What I'm trying to say is that I totally agree with your and other's comments
about CMA essentially grabbing memory and never releasing it but I believe
this can be combat with time when overall idea of haw the CMA API should look
like is agreed upon.
