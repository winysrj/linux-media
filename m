On embedded systems it may be like half of the RAM.  Or a quarter.  So bigger
granularity could be desired on some platforms.

That's how CMA works at the moment.  But if I understand you correctly, what
you are proposing would allow to reserve memory *at* *runtime* long after system
has booted.  This would be a nice feature as well though.

I'll try to look at it then.

Hibernation was not considered as of yet but I think it's device driver's
responsibility more then CMA's especially since it may make little sense to save
some of the buffers -- ie. no need to keep a frame from camera since it'll be
overwritten just after system wakes up from hibernation.  It may also be better
to stop playback and resume it later on rather than trying to save decoder's
state.  Again though, I haven't thought about hibernation as of yet.
