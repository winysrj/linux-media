Hi,

I know the "development process and responsibilities" was the main topic 
during the last media summit. Unfortunately I haven't attended it, from 
the etherpad notes I also cannot quite conclude what decisions have been 
made. Have any measures been discussed and agreed upon for cases, when 
patches don't get reviewed for many months, adding up to more than a year 
(in this specific case the first version submitted in June 2016)?

Thanks
Guennadi
