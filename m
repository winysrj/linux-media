I really don't think we can change this behavior. It's been part of the spec since
forever and it is not just open source apps that can rely on this, but also closed
source. Making an ABI change like this can really mess up applications.

We should instead review the spec and ensure that applications can discover what
is and what isn't supported through e.g. capabilities.
