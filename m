Hi Hans & others,

We at Nokia are very interested indeed in having a mini-summit! The one
in the Linux Plumbers Conference was very useful and I've been looking
forward for the next one awhile. :-)

However, I can't personally commit to any of these dates in April yet.
Option D would be more certain for me. I will know more in a few days.

Regards,
