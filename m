I have been recording (church services) using xawtv (streamer) and 
composite video input to create avi files.

I have discovered that the maximum size that the avi can reach is about 
2GB - and obviously, this is affected by frame size and frame rate - 
and, of course, length of recording. 

I particularly like the ability of being able to start the capture 
process using command-line parameters.

I have the opportunity to renew the system and would appreciate any 
suggestions about what I might do different next time.

Regards
