How about this: rather than adding a band selection control, why not add a
new band field to struct v4l2_hw_freq_seek? The default, 0, means just use the
full frequency range. Then define the other bands (these are pretty much
standardized). If a band is not supported by the hardware, -ERANGE is returned.
Otherwise the current frequency is clamped to the specified band frequency range
and you start searching.

Band selection doesn't really make sense outside of hardware seek.
