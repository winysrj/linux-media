Hi Mauro,
Great news, please count me in. We are currently building a new
ChromeOS graphics/media stack based on V4L2, vb2, dmabuf, DRM and GL.
Synchronization/shared resource usage is one important topic for
discussion, as well as, depending on interest, perhaps optimizations
like CPU cache maintenance, dmabuf hint/caching sglists, sharing
mappings between drivers, etc. Perhaps others would also have
something to add to this list.

Thanks!
Pawel Osciak
