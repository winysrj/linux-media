I'm game for that, but it is a long train ride. I'm up in Aberdeen which
is 8 hours from London by train. Also, I'm travelling next week to
California (Collaboration summit), so it will have to be in 2 weeks
time.

Why don't we instead try a Google Hangout or a phone call today.
Anywhere between 11:30 and 14:00 GMT would work for me. I'd offer to
provide the tea, but I haven't quite perfected transporter technology
yet.
