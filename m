Kernel licensing is not a pure GPL license. If it were a pure GPL license, all software
that would run on the top of it would need to also be released under GPL.

Kernel license is GPLv2 + additional rights to allow binary code to run on the top 
of it, for the system calls that are introduced in order to allow the usage of
the hardware resources managed by the Kernel (drivers, network, memory, CPU's, etc).

There are no doubts that dvb developers wanted their drivers to be controlled from
userspace, but, from previous discussions about this subject, several developers
explicitly said that they didn't want to allow any kind of wrapper module to be added.

Mauro.
