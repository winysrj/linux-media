Just a few high-level comments, I'm between conference travel but
hopefully I can discuss this a bit at plumbers next week.

- I agree that for the insane specific cases we need something opaque like
  the access constraints mask you propose here. But for the normal case I
  think the existing dma constraints in dma_params would go a long way,
  and I think we should look at Rob's RFC from aeons ago to solve those:

  https://lkml.org/lkml/2012/7/19/285

  With this we should be able to cover the allocation constraints of 90%
  of all cases hopefully.

- I'm not sure whether an opaque bitmask is good enough really, I suspect
  that we also need various priorities between different allocators. With
  the option that some allocators are flat-out incompatible.

- The big bummer imo with ION is that it fully side-steps, but this
  proposal here also seems to add entirely new allocators. My rough idea
  was that at allocate/attach time we iterate over all attached devices
  like in Rob's patch and compute the most constrained allocation
  requirements. Then we pick the underlying dma api allocator for these
  constraints. That probably means that we need to open up the dma api a
  bit. But I guess for a start we could simply try to allocate from the
  most constrained device. Together with the opaque bits you propose here
  we could even map additional crazy requirements like that an allocation
  must come from a specific memory bank (provided by a special-purpose CMA
  region). That might also mean that requirements are exclusive and no
  allocation is possible.

- I'm not sure we should allow drivers to override the access constraint
  checks really - the dma_buf interfaces already provide this possibility
  through the ->attach callback. In there exporters are allowed to reject
  the attachment for any reason whatsover.

- I think we should at least provide a helper implementation to allocate
  dma-buffers for multiple devices using the dma constraints logic we
  implement here. I think we should even go as far as providing a default
  implementation for dma-bufs which uses dma_alloc_coherent and this new
  dma contstraints computation code internally. This should be good enough
  for almost all devices, except those that do crazy stuff like swap
  support of buffer objects (gem/ttm), virtual hardware buffers (vmwgfx)
  or have other special needs (e.g. non-coherent buffers as speed
  optimization).

Cheers, Daniel
