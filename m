I wonder how it could work. Look at the actual code:

	val = val ? 0x9e : 0x00;
	if (sd->sensor == SENSOR_OV767x) {
		sccb_reg_write(gspca_dev, 0x2a, 0x00);
		if (val)
			val = 0x9d;	/* insert dummy to 25fps for 50Hz */
	}
	sccb_reg_write(gspca_dev, 0x2b, val);

According to the ov7720/ov7221 documentation, the register 2b is:

	2B EXHCL 00 RW Dummy Pixel Insert LSB
	               8 LSB for dummy pixel insert in horizontal direction

How could it act on the light frequency filter?
