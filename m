Ok then.

At least devices could be start/stopped, and frankly if someone loads
the bus with two high-bandwidth isoc streams, there is no reason to
expect any bulk transfer to happen at all.

I though it would be good for generality -- i.e. if someone wants to
limit maximum isoc bandwidth to say 50% so that would never be
overallocated by that limit that would be handy.

But I agree - it's a bit artificial, so in updated patch I've left what
you originally suggested to be 100 <= uframe_periodic_max < 125 (ommitting =125).


Thanks,
