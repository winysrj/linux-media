I've talked about this with Kay in the past (Plumbers conference I
think) and I thought he said it was all fixed in the latest version of
udev so there shouldn't be any problems anymore with this.

Mauro, what version of udev are you using that is still showing this
issue?

Kay, didn't you resolve this already?  If not, what was the reason why?
