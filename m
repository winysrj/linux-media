The idea is to eventually remove info/err/warn from usb.h by
changing the code outside of drivers/usb first.

There will always be some mix of printk or pr_<level> along
with dev_<level> because struct device * is NULL or as is
mostly used here there's no struct imon_context * available.

I suggest you have a look and see which ones of these
changes could use dev_<level> instead.

cheers, Joe
