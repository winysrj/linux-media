Subject: [RFC 0/2] media: platform: Add Aspeed Video Engine driver
Date: Thu, 16 Aug 2018 14:43:19 -0500

The Video Engine (VE) embedded in the Aspeed AST2400 and AST2500 SOCs
can capture and compress video data from digital or analog sources. With
the Aspeed chip acting as a service processor, the Video Engine can
capture the host processor graphics output.

This series adds a V4L2 driver for the VE, providing a read() interface
only. The driver triggers the hardware to capture the host graphics output
and compress it to JPEG format.

Testing on an AST2500 determined that the videobuf/streaming/mmap interface
was significantly slower than the simple read() interface, so I have not
included the streaming part.

It's also possible to use an automatic mode for the VE such that
re-triggering the HW every frame isn't necessary. However this wasn't
reliable on the AST2400, and probably used more CPU anyway due to excessive
interrupts. It was approximately 15% faster.
