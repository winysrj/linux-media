More comments from irc:
"22:09 < crope> arekm: any current DVB USB driver. there is very many of 
integrated (2-in-1, or 3-in-1) drivers which are splitted correctly
22:10 < crope> ec168, af9015, some dibcom models?, ce6320, rtl2831u
22:11 < crope> you *must* implement all logical parts as own drivers no matter 
of those are integrated to one silicon or not. it is generally seen those
               parts used are sold as not integrated too
22:12 < crope> for example that IT9135, I really think it uses af9033 demod, 
which is sold as own part and also integrated to af9015. and very likely 
IT9135
               contains same USB-brdge than AF9035. only difference is 
integrated tuner
22:13 < crope> so IT9135 == AF9035+ ITXXXX tuner in one package. when you 
split driver correctly to logical parts you can use same drivers
22:14 < crope> and AF9035 == AF903XX USB-bridge + AF9033 demod
22:17 < crope> all DVB USB drivers we have consist of 2 parts (drivers). 1) 
USB-interface driver (aka DVB USB) 2) demodulator driver 3) tuner driver
22:17 < crope> all DVB USB drivers we have consist of 3 parts (drivers). 1) 
USB-interface driver (aka DVB USB) 2) demodulator driver 3) tuner driver
