If imx-media finds a subdev in the device tree that is ultimately linked
to an IPU CSI port, then it needs to maintain information about that
subdev so that imx-media can field an async registration from it and setup
media links to/from it. That info is contained in struct imx_media_subdev.

Besides async registration and media link setup, I've done an audit on
the other ways struct imx_media_subdev is used.

One other usage is to locate a CSI entity in PRP entity, but CSI 
entities _must_
be known to imx-media, so no problem there.

Another usage is to locate the originating source entity (the sensor) in 
CSI entity,
to retrieve media bus config. But there will be an originating device in 
the OF
graph, and imx-media necessarily needs to know about that one.

Finally, besides the regression in imx_media_add_vdev_to_pad(), there is one
other problem usage of imx_media_find_subdev_by_sd() which I will post a 
patch
for. See below [1].

Oops, sorry you are right. I reviewed the control inheritance code
and I've forgotten some details.

imx_media_inherit_controls() will start adding control handlers starting
from the source entity from a link_notify. As long as that source entity
is known to imx-media, imx_media_inherit_controls() moves upstream
without the need for a struct imx_media_subdev. If the source entity is
_not_ known, link_notify will fail before attempting to inherit controls 
[1].

So never mind my erroneously suggested error message, in fact I wouldn't
mind if you removed the error message altogether, or convert to debug.

[1] This is a bug, if imx_media_link_notify() gets a source subdev not know
to imx-media, it should return 0, not an error code. The link_notify op 
is only
used to inherit controls, and the controls for the unknown subdev will get
inherited later anyway, starting from a subdev that is known to imx-media.
I will post a patch to fix.
