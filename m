1. Ensure that user 'myself' is a member of the 'video' group.
2. Launch the webcam application Cheese from the GNOME desktop.

Expected result: Cheese displays whatever this laptop's camera sees.

Actual result: Cheese crashes while attempting to access the camera.

100%

It probably was 3.1.0 or some earlier 3.2 release (the upcoming Debian
will release with 3.2.x; 3.4 was only used here for testing purposes),
but I wouldn't know for sure since I don't use my webcam too often.

See http://bugs.debian.org/677533

When testing the camera using the closed-source Skype 4.x compiled for
Debian, the video preferences dialog shows that a USB 2.0 camera is
found at /dev/video0. However, no image is shown. This would confirm the
assumption that the issue lies with the kernel video driver, rather than
with the Gstreamer framework that Cheese uses to access the camera.

Let's indeed hope so. Thanks for providing these instructions!
