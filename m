Hi Jean-Michel,

We've done some work with another FPD-Link de-serializer (ds90ux940) and 
IIRC we had some trouble figuring out how to coax the lanes into LP-11 
state. But on the ds90ux940 it can be done by setting bit 7 in the CSI 
Enable Port registers (offsets 0x13 and 0x14). But the "imx6-mipi-csi2: 
clock lane timeout" message is something else and indicates the 
de-serializer is not activating the clock lane during its s_stream(ON) 
subdev call.

Hope that helps,
Steve
