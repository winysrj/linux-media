No, not in any context at all!
It's you who ignores the sarcasm behind my words!
Just use your brain, austrian!

YES! This would have made everything easier: NOT to have persons like YOU and 
Manu A. around here, as nobody needs anti-team working big-mouth-nut-shuts 
here.

Yesno! It also takes social behaviour to maintain written code, and if someone 
does not respect social behaviour but claims to be chief DVB maintainer at the 
same time then this indian person called A. is counter productive / 
ridiculous!
And that's all about him.
We gotta get rid of people like you, Markus, and Manu A. too because you two 
are like an incarnation of the living copounter productive pest, arenn't you?
