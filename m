Yes. Although this example is unfortunate since the TPG can actually scale:
with tpg_reset_source you define the width/height of the 'source', and with
tpg_s_crop_compose you can define the crop and compose rectangles, which in
turn translates to scaling. The TPG has a poor man's scaler, so if you scale
up by a factor of 2, you will in fact see those deformations.

But if you have a complex pipeline with e.g. two scalers with additional
processing in between, then that cannot be modeled accurately with the TPG.
So be it. There is a balance between accuracy and performance, and I think
this is a decent compromise.
