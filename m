First let me acknowledge jusst technologies contribution.  It seems
generous.  Thank you for clarifying.

Manu clarified this.

This is where you misrepresent my words: "I can't help but think..." is
phrase that doesn't not imply certainty but indicates my *perception*.
I did not assert this as fact, as the following statement started "If
so, ..." which is a conditional clause.

Maybe this subtlety is lost in translation.

No.  It was my ill researched, emotive response to Manu attacking
someone.

My point was to suggest to Manu that there were more productive ways to
further his cause than to throw stones at people.

Manu, who you support, BTW, was the one who initially introduced
allegations of a developer introducing corporate politics.

There was no searching involved.  That quote was text I cut out in my
initial response.  I reinserted it to refute Manu's denial.

Let me help you.  Please read these postings of mine and give me your
honest feedback:

http://linuxtv.org/pipermail/linux-dvb/2008-September/028651.html
http://linuxtv.org/pipermail/linux-dvb/2008-September/028727.html


Are these the emails of someone who doesn't care about the technical
aspects?

I didn't post them to the LKML because I didn't think the issue needed
expand to there.

I said no such thing.  The implication was that politics often
(tragically IMO) often weigh heavier than technical merit in making
decision.   This was my recommendation to Manu not to neglect that
aspect, lest he get shortchanged.  I was trying to help/advise.  Maybe
that was not clear.

Then tell Manu not to initiate with unkind allegations, and he won't
evoke the same in return.  Again, the horror of the whole mess is what
moved me to respond. 

I couldn't give $0.02 about the new API.  I don't think I'll ever need
it myself.  That's a selfish US user's perspective, but it also
validates my motivation for responding: to try and stop the animosity.

I'm sorry if you feel I've somehow injured the name of jusst
technologies.  That certainly wasn't any intention of mine.

Andy
