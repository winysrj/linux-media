The hybrid devices such as the one you described are the precise
reason we wanted to make a single list.  Your device has analog
aspects that would be covered by V4L and ATSC/QAM aspects that were
covered under linux-dvb.  So discussions about devices such as yours
would take place on both mailing lists, which creates a huge headache
for developers.
