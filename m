as far as i know there already exists a driver but it could not be published 
as it is based on the micronas refernce driver 

i think the problem is related to 

http://www.linuxtv.org/pipermail/linux-dvb/2008-December/030738.html

but this new situation with
http://www.tridentmicro.com/Product_drx_39xyK.asp

can maby change something about this chip

and it would be possible to get the rights to publish the driver under  gpl-2

thx
Mario
