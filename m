If the device supports read(/write) mode, I suppose you could simply read

the device node as a file.



'vlc v4l2c:///dev/video0 --demux h264' might work "thanks" to a software

bug whereby the format is not reset, but I have not tried. V4L2 H.264 is

supported in VLC version 2.0.2-git: 'vlc v4l2:///dev/video0:chroma=h264'.
