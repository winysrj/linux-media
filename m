This is what we did for display, sound and multi-touch on Xen:
we have implemented generic protocols which are OS agnostic.
Have you started prototyping such a protocol for hyper-dmabuf yet?

Should we add corresponding communities into discussion then?

Can you give a use-case for this? I mean that the system integrator
is the one who defines which guests/hosts talk to each other,
but querying means that it is possible that VMs have some sort
of discovery mechanism, so they can decide on their own whom
to connect to.

Let me describe the rationale and some implementation details of the Xen
zero-copy driver I posted recently [1].

The main requirement for us to implement such a helper driver was an ability
to avoid memory copying for large buffers in display use-cases. This is why
we only focused on DRM use-cases, not trying to implement something
generic. This is why the driver is somewhat coupled with Xen 
para-virtualized
DRM driver [2] by Xen para-virtual display protocol [3] grant references
sharing mechanism, e.g. backend receives an array of Xen grant references to
frontend's buffer pages. These grant references are then used to construct a
PRIME buffer. The same mechanism is used when backend shares a buffer 
with the
frontend, but in the other direction. More details on UAPI of the driver are
available at [1].

So, when discussing a possibility to share dma-bufs in a generic way I would
also like to have the following considered:

1. We are targeting ARM and one of the major requirements for the buffer
sharing is the ability to allocate physically contiguous buffers, which gets
even more complicated for systems not backed with an IOMMU. So, for some
use-cases it is enough to make the buffers contiguous in terms of IPA and
sometimes those need to be contiguous in terms of PA.
(The use-case is that you use Wayland-DRM/KMS or share the buffer with
the driver implemented with DRM CMA helpers).

2. For Xen we would love to see UAPI to create a dma-buf from grant 
references
provided, so we can use this generic solution to implement zero-copying 
without
breaking the existing Xen protocols. This can probably be extended to other
hypervizors as well.

Thank you,
Oleksandr Andrushchenko
