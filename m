Hi, I was just wondering if anyone could tell me is this card works
for analog TV (NTSC, PAL).  I see from this page it says something
about analog not supported which doesn't seem right.  What does this
really mean?



It is supported under Linux since kernel 2.6.27. (Note: Analog support
is not implemented yet).
