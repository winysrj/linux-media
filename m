No.  More documentation is never the answer to people not reading
existing documentation.

How about people just read the API and comply with it rather than
doing their own thing all the time?  We've already had at least one
instance where someone has tried using IS_ERR() with the ioremap()
return value.

Really, if you're going to program kernel space, it is very important
that you *know* the interfaces that you're using and you comply with
them.  Otherwise, you have no business saying that you're a kernel
programmer.

Yes, the odd mistake happens, but that's no excuse for the constant
blatent mistakes with stuff like IS_ERR_OR_NULL() with clk_get()
which just comes from total laziness on the part of the coder to
understand the interfaces being used.  Hell, it's even documented
in linux/clk.h - that just shows how many people read the
documentation which has been around since the clk API came about.
