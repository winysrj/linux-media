Right, that's what I remembered from previous code.  There's no way this
should be a regmap bus - a bus is something that gets data serialised by
the core into a byte stream, having the data rendered down into a byte
stream and then reparsing it is a bit silly.  The device should be
hooking in before the data gets marshalled which we can't currently do
but it shouldn't be too hard to make it so that we can have register
read and write functions supplied in the regmap config.

This is very normal, indeed modern CODEC drivers can leave the chip
powered down whenever it's not performing some function.

No, what you're doing is totally sensible.  It needs a bit of extension
to the framework before you can do it though.
