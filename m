You're misrepresenting the proposed changes now.

I'm trying to fixup the scancode handling in the best way possible, I'm 
not willfully breaking anything.

Some things are inconsistent right now between the drivers, in such a 
situation when driver A says "first X then Y" and driver B says "first Y 
then X" the situation is:

a) already "broken"; and

b) can't be fixed without introducing "breakage" of a different kind to 
either A or B

Not really. 32 bits are transmitted no matter what you call the 
protocol. I'm proposing storing those 32 bits in the scancode<->keycode 
table. Not what I'd call an exception (this particular point starts to 
feel a bit off-topic though so I think we can drop it).

You didn't answer this part. It's actually one of the biggest reasons 
for introducing the full scancode everywhere.

No problem, I could respin the patch to also patch the keytables (which 
is what I did first), but I'll wait until we've agreed on something).

18bc17448147e93f31cc9b1a83be49f1224657b2, since it changes the scancode 
it'll break userspace keytables, it's mentioned in patch 4/11 in my 
patchset.

Whether the hardware you happen to have agrees is beside the point?

I know we can't be 100% sure, but the byte order in the driver itself 
also supports the notion that the address bytes have been reversed.

Yes, I agree, but I'm not sure what your point is? Existing hardware 
doesn't lose support with my patches?

Why 0x0000ffff?....the example I gave suggested HW which throws away one 
byte, meaning the last three bytes (0x6b01fe) remain valid?

Not sure what you're suggesting?
