Well, VB1 is working with the old behavior, as the breakage on saa7134
only happened after its migration to VB2. So, the Gstreamer version
you tested is still very likely broken with VB1.

So, I still think that the less damage is to revert the POLLERR patch,
with, according to Hans, is also a violation at the documented API.

Good to know.

The DQBUF locking fixup was merged on libv4l2 for version 1.2. So, the
potential breakage happens when libv4l2 is 1.2 and Gstreamer versions
before 1.4.

Do you have any procedure on gstreamer to fix a bug on stable releases?

Those VBI applications don't have any, as they're not actively
maintained anymore. Even if we patch them today, I guess it could take
a long time for those changes to be propagated on distros.

So, I guess that the best is to try to fix Gstreamer on the distros
that are using libv4l version 1.2 and a pre-1.4 Gstreamer version.
