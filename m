This however is wrong. Just like DMA on the stack this breaks
coherency rules. You may do DMA to the heap in the sense that
you can do DMA to buffers allocated on the heap, but you cannot
do DMA to a part of another structure allocated on the heap.
You need a separate kmalloc for each buffer.
You can reuse the buffer with proper locking, but you must allocate
it seperately once.
