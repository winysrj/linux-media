   Hello guys,



I have been reworking the V4L2 input in VLC and I hit what looks like a

weird bug in the UVC driver. I am using a Logitech HD Pro C920 webcam.



By default, VLC tries to find the highest possible frame rate (actually

smallest frame interval in V4L2), then the largest possible resolution at

that frame rate.



When enumerating the frame sizes and intervals on the device, the winner

is 800x600 at 30 f/s. But when setting 30 f/s with VIDIOC_S_PARM, the

system call returns 24 f/s. Does anyone know why it is so? Is this a

firmware bug or what?
