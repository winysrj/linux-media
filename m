This inline patch fixes the second "poison overwritten" problem so:
Tested-by: Sitsofe Wheeler <sitsofe@yahoo.com>

However, it does not prevent the original oops that was reported in the
original message. Yang Ruirui's patch in
https://lkml.org/lkml/2011/9/1/74 seems to be required to resolve
that initial problem - can it be ACK'd? Yang's patch is reproduced
inline below:

For uvc device, dev->vdev.dev is the &intf->dev,
uvc_delete code is as below:
	usb_put_intf(dev->intf);
	usb_put_dev(dev->udev);

	uvc_status_cleanup(dev);
	uvc_ctrl_cleanup_device(dev);

## the intf dev is released above, so below code will oops.

	if (dev->vdev.dev)
		v4l2_device_unregister(&dev->vdev);
Fix it by get_device in v4l2_device_register and put_device in v4l2_device_disconnect
