Hi Hermann,

We will try what you suggest.

2 things :

- when kaffeine hangs , the owner try the analogic part with kdetv , no 
results,
but after that, trying  kaffeine, dvb works for another few seconds and 
so on ...

-we replace tda10046.fw by tda10046livefiew and before rev in log was 20 
with 3 attempts, after, rev 23 at the first time


Will post dmesg with gpio-tracking

Cheers,

Thomas
