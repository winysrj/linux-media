Please note that Micah Dowty is the maintainer of vusb-analyzer. I
mostly cleaned, etc. its usbmon support (which was originally added by
Christoph Zimmermann). Anyway, you're always free to try to add support
for another file format. I must say that Micah was rather easy to work
with.

Micah had a vmware.com address last time I contacted him. That should
explain that focus.

This is not something I know much about. I tried to use some digital
camera over USB with qemu without much success. Apparently qemu's USB
pass through has little chance of supporting high bandwidth USB devices.
See
http://lists.nongnu.org/archive/html/qemu-devel/2010-09/msg00017.html
for the - not very interesting - answer I got when I wanted to know more
about the problems of USB pass through in qemu.
