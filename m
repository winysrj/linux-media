The change makes sense to me, FWIW.  One bit of trivia I noticed while
looking at it:

The comment at the beginning of this hunk is no longer accurate since the
poll_table is, indeed, still being supplied.  The previous comment in the
same function:

				/*
				 * Fish for events. If we found one, record it
				 * and kill the poll_table, so we don't
				 * needlessly register any other waiters after
				 * this. They'll get immediately deregistered
				 * when we break out and return.
				 */

Could also use tweaking.
