Hi Mauro,

Contrary to other webcam drivers, gspca already has a fallback to a
different altsetting. Actually, this is done at URB submit time and it
works correctly, mainly with USB-1.1. It seems that the bandwidth may be
now checked when setting the altsetting. The proposed patch does not
change the gspca logic at all. Maybe it could be done in a clearer way.

A first problem with webcams is that the bandwidth is not fully known
when starting the capture. The frame rate may be changed during
streaming either by direct video control (rare) or by changing the
exposure time (manual or automatic - AEC). Also, the video stream is
often compressed and the compression ratio is not well known (some
webcams automatically change the JPEG quality).

The second problem is the USB interface. If a driver could calculate a
good estimation of the needed bandwidth, it cannot actually tell it to
the USB subsystem. The USB subsystem uses the packet length and the
message interval to calculate the bandwidth that the device will use.
This is indeed not correct because the device does not send data at the
full interface speed. In an other way, a driver could search the
alternate setting which matches the best its estimated bandwidth, but I
am not sure that this will not slow down the frame rate (more USB
packets for the same data volume).

Hi Sarah,

Your patch should be changed to follow the global altsetting fallback
mechanism. This mechanism is inside the function gspca_init_transfer().
If usb_set_interface() returns an error when the bandwidth is not wide
enough (BTW, which is this error?), it should called inside the loop
and, so, removed from get_ep().

Cheers.
