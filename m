I tend to agree with this.  Ultimately what's important is not
necessarily that the readings are 100% accurate, but rather simply put
into some kind of universal scale that provides useful output to the
user.  Many users were happy to see some activity addressing this
issue and unfortunately it seems to have stalled out but I'm not sure
why.  I honestly felt there was enough common ground being discussed
that we'd have a solution by now.

Regards.
