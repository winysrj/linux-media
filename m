Hello,

I've got the TechnoTrend S2-3650 CI and I want to use it on Ubuntu
Maverick x64 (2.6.35-23-generic).
I followed the intructions on the linuxtv wiki, but I can't tune into
a channel, that is what w_scan says, while kaffeine doesn't show any
messages.

Could you please make this device work? I would be very happy about
that and I would, if needed, help you to debug!

Hope to hear from you soon ;)

Thomas-Karl Pietrowski
