iopmem is not applicable to GPU what i propose is to split the issue in 2
so that everyone can reuse the part that needs to be common namely the DMA
API part where you have to create IOMMU mapping for one device to point
to the other device memory.

We can have a DMA API that is agnostic to how the device memory is manage
(so does not matter if device memory have struct page or not). This what
i have been arguing in this thread. To make progress on this issue we need
to stop conflicting different use case.

So i say let solve the IOMMU issue first and let everyone use it in their
own way with their device. I do not think we can share much more than
that.

Cheers,
Jérôme
