The event_queue_lock protects 2 things:
1. Refcount to dma_fence won't drop to 0 if val->fences[i] != NULL
Creator is supposed to keep a refcount until after dma_fence_signal
returns. Adding a refcount you release in the callback won't help
you here much.

2. Integrity of request->prime_list
The list_del's are otherwise not serialized, leaving a corrupted
list if 2 fences signal at the same time. kref_put in the non-free'ing
case is simply an atomic decrement, so there's no measurable penalty
for keeping it in the lock.

So no, you could remove it from the kref_put, but val->fences[i] = NULL
assignment would still need it, so there's no real penalty left for
putting kref_put in the spinlock to also protect the second case
without dropping/retaking lock.

I'll add dma_fence_remove_callback that returns a bool of whether
the callback was removed or not. In the latter case the fence already
fired. However, if you call dma_fence_remove_callback twice, on the
wrong fence, or without ever calling dma_fence_add_callback you'd
undefined behavior, and there's no guarantee I could detech such
situation, but with those constraints I think it could be useful to
have.

It sucks but prime_rm_lock is the inner lock so the only way not to
deadlock is doing what I'm doing there, or not getting the hardware
locked in the first place.

Ok, I'll see if I can make a set of functions that follow the normal rules
for these types of functions.
