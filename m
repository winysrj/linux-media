Hi all,

I've been trying to put together a recomendation for the right
combination of DVB-S (or S2?), CI, and CAM that can handle Irdeto
encryption but after days of searching and finding lots of little
pieces of information, I have not been able to find any examples of
people running the right combinations of hardware running on Linux.

There's plenty examples of it running on other platforms (MCE etc.)
but finding the right combination of Tuner Card + CI, and CI + CAM
that is all supported on Linux is proving to be a problem.

Is any body running a Linux setup based on this?

I'd really appreciate any feedback from your valuable experience as
I'm really not able to find any examples of people saying "I have this
working".

Many thanks in advance.

Regards
