Hi!

I found out that s2-3200 doesn't only have problems with 30000 3/4 8psk, but also with 22000 5/6 8psk like TVP @ Astra 10862 h has.

It's on a spot beam from today on, but yesterday femon showed me signal, carrier and sync but no Lock, exactly like the scandinavian channels at Thor.

8psk 22000 2/3 is no problem.


regards


Newsy
