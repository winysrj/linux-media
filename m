Great info. I'm less familiar with the way that Cable is 
transmitted, but I do understand that ATSC carries multiple 
channels per frequency. Are you suggesting that I could 
capture a single stream from a single tuner which would 
contain several channels, and pull the CC data for all of 
those channels from a single stream? Would QAM work similarly? 
( Assuming the feed is unencrypted )

I've found that most, if not all, cable boxes do not pass 
through CC data, because they are meant to interpret it and 
pass it on with customized formatting and whatnot, so another 
scaling challenge will be finding a feed that I can use 
without a cable box. OTA broadcasts have been my testing 
ground because they are so readily available.
