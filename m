The type is currently used to distinguish between entities that stream media 
data from/to memory and other entities. They need to be handled differently in 
the kernel for power management purposes for instance.

I'm not sure if we should create new types, or just remove the type/subtype 
distinction and add a flag somewhere.

Martin Rubli has already proposed something similar a while ago on the linux-
media mailing list. His proposal didn't use TLV though.

So EXT_SPEAKER are speakers not connected through a jack (USB, internal 
analog, ...) ?

Does EXT_BROADCAST represent the TV tuner (or satellite receiver, cable tuner, 
radio tuner, ...) itself, or the connection between the tuner and the rest of 
the device ? Most TV tuner are currently handled by V4L2 and would thus turn 
up as V4L2 subdevs (I'm not sure if that's what we want in the long term, but 
it's at least the current situation).

Right. Same for USB Video Class.

We could let drivers set the entity ID, and have the core fill it if the value 
is 0. Non-zero values would have to be checked for uniqueness though. Hans, a 
comment on that ?
