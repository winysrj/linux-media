I tested your patch with both ir-keytable and the input-kbd (with the
version check fixed) on the top of a vanilla 2.6.37 kernel. It works
with both tools.

Feel free to add:

Tested-by: Mauro Carvalho Chehab <mchehab@redhat.com>

Btw, I took some time to take analyse the input-kbd stuff.
As said at the README:

	This is a small collection of input layer utilities.  I wrote them
	mainly for testing and debugging, but maybe others find them useful
	too :-)
	...
	Gerd Knorr <kraxel@bytesex.org> [SUSE Labs]

This is an old testing tool written by Gerd Hoffmann probably used for him
to test the V4L early Remote Controller implementations. I think he never
meant to use it for anything else. So that's probably the reason why he 
added a check for a specific input version.

The last "official" version seems to be this one:
	http://dl.bytesex.org/cvs-snapshots/input-20081014-101501.tar.gz

I don't think that Gerd is still maintaining it. On a quick search,
it seems that most distros don't ship it (Debian being an exception).

Gerd, if you're still maintaining it, it is a good idea to apply Dmitry's
patch:
	http://www.spinics.net/lists/linux-input/msg13728.html
Otherwise, the tool won't work for NEC-extended and RC-6 tables.

Most of the tools found on Gerd's input package can be replaced with gains
by ir-keytable [1][2].
[1] http://git.linuxtv.org/v4l-utils.git
[2] http://linuxtv.org/downloads/v4l-utils/v4l-utils-0.8.2.tar.bz2

The output format for input-kbd is compatible with the input format of
ir-keytable.

So, people that are using input-kbd to work with a remote controller at
/dev/input/event2 can read the existent RC tables with:
	# input-kbd 2 >input_kbd_rc_map
or:
	# ir-keytable -r >ir_keytable_rc_map

In order to replace the table, people can use:
	# input-kbd -f some_rc_map 2
or:
	# ir-keytable -cw input_kbd_rc_map
	# ir-keytable -cw ir_keytable_rc_map

To list Remote Controller input devices:
	$ ir-keytable
		(somewhat similar to what lsinput does)

To test input events:
	# input-events 2
	# ir-keytable -t

However, as said previously in this thread, input-kbd won't work with any
RC table that uses NEC extended (and there are several devices on the
current Kernels with those tables), since it only reads up to 16 bits.

ir-keytable works with all RC tables, if you use a kernel equal or upper to
2.6.36, due to the usage of the new ioctl's.

ir-keytable also gets some additional data from the remote controllers,
available via sysfs (/sys/class/rc).

Thanks,
Mauro
