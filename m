I don't think we should distinguish IP block from HW. I would also use
a different namespace for SW implementation like the DVB demux or
for API devnodes.

Perhaps:
	ENT_T_API - for non-subdev API device nodes;
	ENT_T_HW - for hardware/firmware/IP blocks;
	ENT_T_SW - for software emulation blocks like DVB demux

I would not map subdev API as a separate entity, as those should have
a 1:1 map to the entity. So, a property (or a flag) should be enough
to indicate that either a ENT_T_HW_ or a ENT_T_SW_ is exposed via a
subdev.

With regards to the API mapping, I would have a set of properties that
would be grouping V4L2, subdev, DVB, ... parts of the API.

So, for example, if the entity that represents a video devnode
controls the tuner, the analog demod and the DMA engine, such
entity would have 3 properties:
	- ENT_PROP_V4L2_TUNER
	- ENT_PROP_V4L2_ATV_DEMOD
	- ENT_PROP_V4L2_DMA

> And the properties will tell what functions it supports.

Yes, but, as the API right now groups the subtypes, it would
be better to keep it splitted, not for userspace to use this as
subtype. Just as a matter of keeping things well organized.

I mean, if you take a look at the resulting namespace after all
those patches I wrote, the end result is:

#define MEDIA_ENT_T_UNKNOWN	0

#define MEDIA_ENT_T_AV_DMA		(((1 << 16)) + 1)
#define MEDIA_ENT_T_DTV_DEMOD	(MEDIA_ENT_T_AV_DMA + 3)
#define MEDIA_ENT_T_DTV_DEMUX	(MEDIA_ENT_T_AV_DMA + 4)
#define MEDIA_ENT_T_DTV_DVR	(MEDIA_ENT_T_AV_DMA + 5)
#define MEDIA_ENT_T_DTV_CA	(MEDIA_ENT_T_AV_DMA + 6)
#define MEDIA_ENT_T_DTV_NET	(MEDIA_ENT_T_AV_DMA + 7)

#define MEDIA_ENT_T_CAM_SENSOR	((2 << 16) + 1)
#define MEDIA_ENT_T_CAM_FLASH	(MEDIA_ENT_T_CAM_SENSOR + 1)
#define MEDIA_ENT_T_CAM_LENS	(MEDIA_ENT_T_CAM_SENSOR + 2)
#define MEDIA_ENT_T_ATV_DECODER	(MEDIA_ENT_T_CAM_SENSOR + 3)
#define MEDIA_ENT_T_TUNER	(MEDIA_ENT_T_CAM_SENSOR + 4)

We cannot renumber them, or otherwise things will break. So, we'll have
to deal with at least 2 number spaces: 1 << 16 and 2 << 16.

If we use the 1<<16 number space for ENT_T_API and the 2<<16 for
ENT_T_HW, the above will keep fitting, and it will be easier to maintain,
as we'll be grouping by name.

Yes, this could be a property.

I see V4L_SUBDEV as a set of properties, specifying exactly what group
of subdev ioctls controls an specific hardware entity.

Yes.

Probably yes.

I do prefer using a switch() like I did on patch 10/18, specifying the
entities that belong to subdev. After we add the property API, we can
convert is_media_entity_v4l2_subdev and is_media_entity_av_dma (with
should likely be renamed to is_media_entity_v4l_dma) to use the
properties API.

I don't think we'll need to create a separate number space for the new
entities in order to be backward-compatible.

Let's add this directly when we add the Property API.

Keeping a backward-compatible separate range would create messy graphs.
I don't think we should do it.
