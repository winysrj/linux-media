for bttv it is really easy to find out :)

You look at the MAINTAINERS file on top level of every kernel.

Daniel is for sure also very fine on it and also some others.

To have a chance, that somebody reads it, maybe again, don't post not
working links to the subscribers only and not search-able archive at
RedHat, but prefer the public available mirrors.

It is annoying to dig through it by message numbers after login, since
no direct link works.

BTW, we moved to linux-media@vger.kernel.org.

Cheers,
Hermann
