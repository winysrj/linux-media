Sorry, that I could not reply in-time. I had been traveling and hence.
Also, with little free time in between additionally. Hermann, what's
going on ? I don't see the reason for such a long thread, nor can't
believe that time is so cheap ..

Anyway ... He doesn't do much of coding, or maybe next to nothing. But
he does test hardware and drivers, from what I know, for quite a long
time from the time of the FF cards. I know his real name as Derek
Kelly and on IRC as hotwings. Well, I do appreciate the time he puts
into testing, as it helps to make realize code better, or identify
hardware bugs etc. At least a couple of times, I was able to find bugs
in my own code, thanks to him. But the other side, unlike most people,
he seemed to not have a taste for taking credits at all (don't know
why, eventhough I had pointed out to him a few times) ..

Regards,
Manu
