yes, that was reported by countless people, but I'm not there.

This was only one of the reasons to ask Manu to stop advertising the new
expensive stuff that hard in Europe. The same goes for free S2. It is
nothing more than some blown up "muppets" show you get for now, at least

Results about pointing to it are known ... ;)
