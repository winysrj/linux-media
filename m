Yes, if there were shared fences, they had to issue a wait for the previous exclusive fence, so if you add
(possibly hardware) wait ops on those shared fences to your command stream, it follows that you also
waited for the previous exclusive fence implicitly.

If there is only an exclusive fence, you have to issue some explicit wait op  on it before you start the rest
of the commands.

Correct, if you create a shared fence, you still have to emit a wait op for the exclusive fence.
