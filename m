Thank you for the bug report. And sorry for the delay..

The driver sets same bytesperline value for each plane, since I found
definition of this parameter very vague for planar formats, especially
the macro-block ones, e.g. [1]. So it's really a feature, not a bug ;)

Nevertheless, what the documentation [2] says is:

"\bytesperline\    Distance in bytes between the leftmost pixels in two
adjacent lines."
...

"When the image format is planar the bytesperline value applies to the
largest plane and is divided by the same factor as the width field for
any smaller planes. For example the Cb and Cr planes of a YUV 4:2:0 image
have half as many padding bytes following each line as the Y plane. To
avoid ambiguities drivers must return a bytesperline value rounded up to
a multiple of the scale factor."

Then, for V4L2_PIX_FMT_NV12M format bytesperline for both planes should be
same, since according to the format definition chroma and luma plane width
are same.

For V4L2_PIX_FMT_YUV420M the Cr and Cb plane is half the width and half
the height of the image (Y plane). I agree the bytesperline of the chroma
should be half of that of luma plane.

Please let me know if this patch helps:

If it's OK then I'll submit it for v3.9 kernel.
