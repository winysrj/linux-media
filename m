Maintaining the kernel module would be rather easy, because new
properties added to dvb_frontend would be handled transparently. The
implementation is quite simple. In contrast, implementing and then
maintaining all the users of a newly written userspace library would be
a nightmare in comparison.

How would all this allow to use e.g. dvbsnoop or w_scan on a remote
tuner? Do you propose to add a dependency to this proposed library to
every application?

Furthermore, a GPLv2 library would artificially restrict its users, e.g.
you wouldn't be allowed to use it with gstreamer or just with anything
that isn't GPLv2, not even v3.
