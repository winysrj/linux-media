Please, look at drivers/media/video/videobuf-dma-contig.c. Using coherent memory
is inavoidable for now, there is no alternative for it for now. The two new functions,
which I propose are just helpers for those of us who already use coherent memory
(via videobuf-dma-contig API). May be adding these two functions to 
drivers/media/video/videobuf-dma-contig.c will be better solution?

Thanks.
