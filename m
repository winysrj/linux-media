Yes, that was my first thought, too.
But looking at the resulting gspca subdriver, you will see that there is
not much code duplication.
I would say that adding support for this device as a gspca subdriver
requires less new lines of code than extending/modifying the em28xx driver.

You are talking about the em28xx device capabilities, right ?
AFAIK, the em28xx driver still has no bulk transfer support.

Maybe proprietary is not the best name...
Requests 0x06 an 0x08 are used for the usb control messages.
I have documented that at http://linuxtv.org/wiki/index.php/VAD_Laplace.
Could be the "vendor specific" usb requests the datasheet talks about.

Yes, the device has an eeprom with 16bit addresses.
Anyway, I'm talking about a different format of the eeprom data:
http://wenku.baidu.com/view/a21a28eab8f67c1cfad6b8f6.html

You can find the eeprom content of my device at
http://linuxtv.org/wiki/index.php/VAD_Laplace

I agree. But let's do things step by step...

No, the em2765 itself seems to be very similar to the other
em27xx/em28xx chips.
But the device as a whole is different enough to consider a separate driver.

See the patch posted a minute ago.

Yes, that's right. But on the other hand, the benefit of separate
drivers is simpler code, which is easier to maintain/understand.
For example, there would be no LIRC modules issue ;-)

Sure, code duplication is one of the disadvantages. The question is how
much duplicate code there would be.
