Hi,

I purchased two Nova-HD-S2 a few months ago for my Linux machine to 
replace my old Skystar cards.  So far I have been unsuccessful to patch 
or compile the drivers.
Seems like I have been having to jump though hoops every step of the way.

To be honest I haven't really got the time or patience to figure out 
what's wrong, as I have open source projects of my own to work on.

Has anyone got a pre-patched kernel source with support for my Nova-HD-S2?

Any idea when support with become mainstream?  I'm wondering if I should 
sell these devices, and find something else.
