I'm still trying to understand if this is a theoretical problem, or if
Grant has actually experienced a regression.  His mention of bisecting
made it sound like the latter was the case, but I've yet to hear of
specifically what drivers this was breaking.  Samuel described some
potential driver breakage, but nothing concrete.

I do agree that this needs a better solution, given the theoretical
breakage.

The problem is of mixing "plain" platform devices and MFD devices.
It's reasonable to assume that different hardware may be using
one method or the other to create devices; in order to maintain
compatibility with the driver, one either needs to use a plain platform
device.  Alternatively, if an MFD-specific device class is created,
then MFD devices would start showing up in weird places.
