I was thinking about updating my page [1] with the results I get with 
gspca V2. But I think it would be better to have this info on the 
LinuxTV wiki. Unfortunately, I did not find a page for gspca. So I 
thought I should start one, but I don't think this is the right thing 
because there are other drivers available for webcams.

Why not start a "Webcam compatibly page" similar to my page [1]?
- a photo of the webcam
- USB ID
- capabilities of the cam
- the chipsets when known
- driver + version (+ kernel version), at the time tested
- application used for testing (version)
- links with some information to other interesting pages
- and some more you can think of

What you guys think about it?
