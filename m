V4L2 API has about 80 ioctl's. Add compat code for most of them (as most have
enum's) is not fun.

Also, the issue is not that trivial. Just to give you one example:

struct v4l2_pix_format {
        __u32                   width;
       	__u32                   height;
        __u32                   pixelformat;
        enum v4l2_field         field;
        __u32                   bytesperline;   /* for padding, zero if unused */
        __u32                   sizeimage;
        enum v4l2_colorspace    colorspace;
       	__u32                   priv;           /* private data, depends on pixelformat */
};


This struct has 2 enums, and it is used by a couple structs, like this one:

struct v4l2_framebuffer {
        __u32                   capability;
       	__u32                   flags;
        void                    *base;
       	struct v4l2_pix_format  fmt;
};

This struct is used by a couple ioctls:

#define VIDIOC_G_FBUF            _IOR('V', 10, struct v4l2_framebuffer)
#define VIDIOC_S_FBUF            _IOW('V', 11, struct v4l2_framebuffer)

The better is to really replace "enum" by an integer (__u32?) at the structs,
but this will break existing apps.

One alternative would be to fork this header and add a compat layer
that would print a WARN_ONCE message, if ever reached, asking the user
to re-compile the application against the new header. 

We did that strategy in the past, appending _OLD to the legacy api ioctl's.

There's one ioctl that already provides the API level, plus other info.
This ioctl doesn't contain any enum, so it is backward compatible.

The issue here is with binaries compiled against the old headers. So, this
won't work.

No ioctls (well, except for 2 deprecated ones VIDIOC_G_JPEGCOMP/VIDIOC_S_JPEGCOMP)
are using __u8/__u32/__u64 for integers. The only issue there is with enum's.

Add an #if block there will make the header very hard to deal with, as this
is already complex enough without it. The V4L2 API header has 2420 lines.
Such #if blocks will almost duplicate the header size.

I can see only two viable fixes for it:

1) add a typedef for the enum, using the sizeof(enum) in order to select the
size of the used integer.

Pros:
	- Patch is easy to write/easy to review;
	- Won't change the struct size, so applications compiled without
	  strong gcc optimization won't break;
Cons:
	- It will add a typedef, with is ugly;
	- struct size on 32 bits will be different thant he size on 64 bits
	  (not really an issue, as v4l2-compat32 will handle that;
	- v4l2-compat32 code may require changes.

2) just replace it by a 32 bits integer.

Pros:
	- no typedefs;
	- struct size won't change between 32/64 bits (except when they also
	  have pointers);
Cons:
	- will break ABI. So, a compat code is required;
	- will require a "videodev2.h" fork for the legacy API with the enum's;
	- will require a compat code to convert from enum into integer and
	  vice-versa.
