No, you have to consider the system used and the effects of calls used
on the driver in light of this table:

----------------------------------------------------------------------
MTRR Non-PAT   PAT    Linux ioremap value        Effective memory type
----------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                  Non-PAT |  PAT
     PAT
     |PCD
     ||PWT
     |||
WC   000      WB      _PAGE_CACHE_MODE_WB            WC   |   WC
WC   001      WC      _PAGE_CACHE_MODE_WC            WC*  |   WC
WC   010      UC-     _PAGE_CACHE_MODE_UC_MINUS      WC*  |   UC
WC   011      UC      _PAGE_CACHE_MODE_UC            UC   |   UC
----------------------------------------------------------------------

(*) denotes implementation defined and is discouraged

ioremap_nocache() will use _PAGE_CACHE_MODE_UC_MINUS by default today,
in the future we want to flip the switch and make _PAGE_CACHE_MODE_UC
the default. When that flip occurs it will mean ipath cannot get
write-combining on both non-PAT and PAT systems. Now that is for
the future, lets review the current situation for ipath.

For PAT capable systems if mtrr_add() is used today on a Linux system on a
region mapped with ioremap_nocache() that will mean you effectively nullify the
mtrr_add() effect as the combinatorial effect above yields an effective memory
type of UC.  For PAT systems you want to use ioremap_wc() on the region in
which you need write-combining followed by arch_phys_wc_add() which will *only*
call mtrr_add() *iff* PAT was not enabled. This also means we need to split
the ioremap'd areas so that the area that is using ioremap_nocache() can never
get write-combining (_PAGE_CACHE_MODE_UC). The ipath driver needs the regions
split just as was done for the qib driver.

Now we could just say that leaving things as-is is a non-issue if you are OK
with non-write-combining effects being the default behaviour left on the ipath
driver for PAT systems. In that case we can just use arch_phys_wc_add() on the
driver and while it won't trigger the mtrr_add() on PAT systems it sill won't
have any effect. We just typically don't want to see use of ioremap_nocache()
paired with arch_phys_wc_add(), grammatically the correct thing to do is pair
ioremap_wc() areas with a arch_phys_wc_add() to make the write-combining effects
on non-PAT systems. If the ipath driver is not going to get he work required
to split the regions though perhaps we can live with a corner case driver that
annotates PAT must be disabled on the systems that use it and convert it to
arch_phys_wc_add() to just help with phasing out of direct use of mtrr_add().
With this strategy if and when ipath driver gets a split done it would gain WC
on both PAT and non-PAT.
