I've tested the same HW on the weekend, and can confirm it's not working. 

If you need a working solution quickly, I'd take the box back to the dealer. But I can't recommend any other right now.

Older Skystar devices are working (tested with "Skystar USB" DVB-T). I'm not sure about "Skystar USB plus", but as the driver has only one USD-ID listed ("Skystar USB"), I belive it's not working
