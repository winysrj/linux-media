>From a pattern perspective I have no problem with that.... From an
individual driver binding perspective that is just dumb! It's fine for
the ports node to be optional, but an individual driver using the
binding should be explicit about which it will accept. Please use either
a flag or a separate wrapper so that the driver can select the
behaviour.

That's fine. In that case the driver would specifically require the
endpoint to be that one node.... although the above looks a little weird
to me. I would recommend that if there are other non-port child nodes
then the ports should still be encapsulated by a ports node.  The device
binding should not be ambiguous about which nodes are ports.

See above. The no-ports-node version could be the
for_each_grandchild_of_node() block, and the yes-ports-node version
could be a wrapper around that.

Blurg. On a plane right now. Can't go and read those links.

I'm fine with that.
