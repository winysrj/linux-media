BTW, another issue is that evdev's ioctl returns -EINVAL for unknown
ioctls so applications would have hard time figuring out whether error
returned because of kernel being too old or because they are trying to
retrieve/establish invalid mapping if they had to go only by the error
code.

As far as I can see EINVAL is a proper error for unknown ioctls:

[dtor@hammer work]$ man 2 ioctl | grep EINVAL
       EINVAL Request or argp is not valid.
[dtor@hammer work]$
