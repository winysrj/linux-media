Hi Christoph,

Just had a look at your zip archive and the files.

You are right. 562 MHz as nominal frequency is correct, because for 
DVB-T this is calculated 306 MHz + channel number x 8 MHz. VHF would be 
142.5 MHz + channel number x 7 MHz.

It's just a centre frequency used for tuning purposes. The DVB-T signal 
should (ideally) use a 8 MHz width space from 559.25 MHz to 567.25 MHz 
for Ch 32.

I didn't compare that either. Could also be difficult, because of 
different revision dates.

Looking through your files in the zip archive, it rose some questions in 
my mind:

a) is it really useful to have scan files by federal state (Bundesland)?

Just let me explain with an example. I live in Sachsen-Anhalt on the 
north of the Harz Mountains area. To effectivly ("best") use DVB-T I do 
combine both transmitters in Sachsen-Anhalt (Mt. Brocken) and from 
Niedersachsen (Braunschweig). This is because some channels are only 
available from a specific transmitting site (private channels only from 
Braunschweig, RBB only from Brocken). The same applies to other regions 
in Sachsen-Anhalt (south east will have reception from Sachsen and 
ThÃ¼ringen, north east from Berlin / Brandeburg etc.)

I think, this situation will also apply to other federal states.

=> I personally would prefer to stay with or alternatively provide a 
region based file, so I could look up and combine the regions of 
interest. What do you think?

b) Conflicting information

In your "Sachsen-Anhalt" scanfile you list on Ch 24 the ARD multiplex 
with (Halle-Stadt):

T 498000000 8MHz 2/3 NONE QAM64 8k 1/4 NONE
# CH24: Das Erste, arte, Phoenix, EinsFestival

which is for a large part of Sachsen-Anhalt useless (we can't receive 
that), as we actually receive on Ch 24 (from Braunschweig)

T 498000000 8MHz 2/3 NONE QAM16 8k 1/4 NONE
# CH24: RTL, RTL II, Super RTL, VOX

=> have a look at QAM, its QAM64 in your scanfile and QAM16 for Ch24 we 
actually receive.

=> Does it matter, e.g. would instead of the unreceivable Ch24 from 
Halle-Stadt the Braunschweig Ch24 be found? (I did not test this).

c) You clearly missed out some information. I noticed for instance Ch 37 
in Leipzig (Sachsen) which is the "Leipzig 1" multiplex

Please have a look at the already posted link to SLM or my homepage:

http://www.to-st.de/content/projects/dvb-t/dvbt-sender-leipzig.de.html

On the other hand I doubt, that it would be a useful entry into a 
"Sachsen" scanfile because reception is limited to the area of the city 
of Lepzig.

As I have no overview of regional "special projects" in other area, such 
  omissions in the files may apply to other areas too.

@Barry

Just as a sidenote and for historical purposes I may point you to:

http://www.ifn.ing.tu-bs.de/itg/docs/030403Braunschweig/ITG030403Hoehne_Frequenzplanung.pdf

which gives an overview how in 2003 the concept for the north of Germany 
had been planned. This information is obsolete and has changed, but the 
document show a bit, how decisions evolved in consideration of federal 
state and "Medienanstalt" boundaries (e.g. Bremen) etc.
