Yeah, I have got also 4-chip tw5864 board here :)
Bluecherry decided to switch to it because they are available for retail
purchase, unlike solo* which must be ordered in large batch. It was huge
reverse-engineering effort to make it work, though, and there are still
issues with H.264 encoding functionality, and audio functionality is not
done yet.

Lockup happens only on 6010. In provided log you can see that 6110
passes just fine right before 6010. Also if 6010 PCI ID is removed from
solo6x10 driver's devices list, the freeze doesn't happen.
