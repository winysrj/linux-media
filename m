Hi All,

I'm just wondering if someone can point me in the direction of maybe 
either some documents or a good driver code to look at to understand 
how to write the drivers for cards etc.

As some might have seen as playing with the terratec cinergy 2400i 
which has an old driver and am gonna have a play and see if i can get 
it working.

Not sure if my coding would be good enough to submit to yourselves at 
the moment, but if there is a document to read, as current I dont 
understand how the PCI-e bridge loads and then loads the demod module 
and tuner and how it all links together...

So any documents and maybe an example modules that loads a bridge / 
demod then tuner so i can understand would be great.

Cheers for any help.
