Here I agree with you: "that can be access exclusively by a certain device"

Here I disagree with you: "that can be used for any device for a device".
Reserved coherent memory can be only and exclusively used by 
the __same__ device whose device->dma_mem is touched. No other devices 
are influenced because their device->dma_mem are NULL. and 
dma_alloc_from_coherent() is not invoked for them. That is why I think
this hack is not dangerous. If some device driver decide to reserve some
chunk of memory it is for its private use and no other device in the system
is influenced.

Here I agree with you, but for now we have no alternative in media/video
framework.

Yes, it is just a temporary solution. Just enhancing an existing temporary solution.
