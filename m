I believe it's since the CRISv10 and CRISv32 are very different beasts,
and that is selected via kernel config...

This part of the CRIS port has been transformed a couple of times from
the original layout without uapi, and there's still some legacy silliness,
where some files might have been exported but never used from userspace
except for some corner cases.

This would seem to be a reasonable change.
