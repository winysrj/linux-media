No.

I don't believe it exists currently, so it would need to be created.
Perhaps adding a layer of directory to combine these. This patch alone
is not enough to really justify that, but if there's a lot more shared
code possible then it would be the right direction.

I assume you weren't serious, but no for /of-graph. If a better place
can't be found/made, I'll take it.
