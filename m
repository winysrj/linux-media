There we disagree.  Sure it's a very poorly thought out interface,
but the way to fix it is to put a new one along side the old,
and put the old back the way it was before it got broken.

I'm not making a fuss here for myself -- I'm more than capable of working
around new kernel bugs like these, but for every person like me there are
likely hundreds of others who simply get frustrated and give up.

If you're worried about Ubuntu's adaptation to the buggy regression,
then email their developers (kernel and input-utils packagers) explaining
the revert, and they can coordination their kernel and input-utils updates
to do the Right Thing.

But for all of the rest of us, our systems are broken by this change.

That's the problem: you did NOT keep the two old ioctls().
Those got changed too.. so now we have four NEW ioctls(),
none of which backward compatible with userspace.
