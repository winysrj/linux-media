Alan,

Hans seems to have argued cogently for doing all of this in the kernel and 
for abandoning the usbfs-based drivers for these particular drivers for 
dual-mode cameras and, I would conjecture, for drivers for dual-mode 
hardware in general. Therefore, I anticipate that he won't like that very 
much.

My position:

I do not have preconceptions about how the problem gets handled, and at 
this point I remain agnostic and believe that all approaches ought to be 
carefully analysed. I can imagine, abstractly, that things like this 
could be handled by

-- moving all basic functionality to the kernel, and fixing the 
relevant libgphoto2 drivers to look to the kernel instead of to libusb. 
(What Hans argues for, and I am not opposed if his arguments convince 
other concerned parties)

-- doing some kind of patch job to make current arrangement somehow to 
work better (this seems to be the position of Adam Baker; I do share
the skepticism Hans has expressed about how well this could all be 
pasted together)

-- doing something like the previous, but also figuring out how to bring 
udev rules into play, which would make it all work better (just tossing 
this one in, for laughs, but who knows someone might like it)

-- moving the kernel webcam drivers out of the kernel and doing with these 
cameras _everything_ including webcam function through libusb. I myself do 
not have the imagination to be able to figure out how this could be done 
without a rather humongous amount of work (for example, which streaming 
apps that are currently available would be able to live with this?) but 
unless I misunderstand what he was saying, Greg K-H seems to think that 
this would be the best thing to do.

Which one of these possibile approaches gets adopted is a policy issue 
which I would consider is ultimately way above my pay grade.

My main motivation for bringing up the issue was to get it to the front 
burner so that _something_ gets done. It is a matter which has been left 
alone for too long. Therefore, I am very glad that the matter is being 
addressed.

Let me add to this that I have gotten permission for time off and for a 
expense money which might possibly cover my air fare. I hope to arrive in 
Vancouver by sometime on Monday and intend to attend the mini-summit. I 
suggest that we get all intersted parties together and figure out what is 
the best way to go.

I hope everyone who is actively concerned can meet in Vancouver, and if 
all goes well then on Monday as well as Tuesday. I can hang around for 
another day or two after Tuesday, but I do not expect to register for 
LinuxCon or be involved in it. When I leave Vancouver I will probably go 
to Seattle and spend a couple of days with my oldest son, the musician, 
before coming home on the next weekend.
