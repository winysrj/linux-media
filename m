I've also had this cunning plan that if or when the PWM subsystem
starts supporting the PWM output in OMAP3, I could convert this driver
to generate the IR carrier wave through the PWM subsystem and then use
HR timers to generate the pulses. I think that's much better approach
than trying to depend on interfaces that are not easily
available. Should be possible, but I haven't proven yet that it will
work :)

Unfortunately I haven't got into executing on that plan yet. In
addition to the challenge of scheduling some of my free time for doing
this, my RX51 device is not enumerating the USB with the latest kernel
and I haven't figured out that yet. And because of that, I haven't
been able to get my user space running over nfsroot setup I've been
using..
