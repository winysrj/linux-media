Agreed, this chipset needs some love and attention. I have some patches also 
stacked up, so - this is a tree I've been meaning to get back to.

Submit the patches to the list and I'll try to get some time to create and 
maintain a ~stoth/tm6010 tree. I think I can get the nova-s-usb2 running with 
just a little effort.

Thanks,
