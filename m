Fix it in both drivers with a Cc to stanimir.varbanov@linaro.org (venus) and
s.nawrocki@samsung.com (s5p) to let them test/ack the patch.

Venus is no problem, the s5p driver can decide to keep the old INT control
since it has been in use for such a long time, but that is up to Sylwester to
decide.
