Well, that's imo a bug with the other driver. If it doesn't export
something really simple (e.g. contiguous memory which doesn't require any
mmio resources at all) it should have a cache of exported dma_buf fds so
that it hands out the same dma_buf every time.

Or it needs to be more clever in it's dma_buf_attachment_map functions and
lookup up a pre-existing iommu mapping.

But dealing with this in the importer is just broken.

Like I've said above, just fix this in the exporter. If an importer sees
two different dma_bufs it can very well presume that it those two indeed
point to different backing storage.

This will be even more important if we attach fences two dma_bufs. If your
broken exporter creates multiple dma_bufs each one of them will have their
own fences attached, leading to a complete disasters. Ok, strictly
speaking if you keep the same reservation pointer for each dma_buf it'll
work, but that's just a detail of how you solve this in the exporter.

Cheers, Daniel
