I had googled saa7134-alsa prior to posting and saw a few reports of the problem but no solution. This does seem to be a Ubuntu issue and in one of the reports I looked at (https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux-ubuntu-modules-2.6.24/+bug/212271) it states that the problem does not occurr on a 'stock kernel' from kernel.org.

Hey,

  If you were using MythBuntu and are looking for a similar experience
using a different distro then have a look into MythDora or KnopMyth
for the RedHat and Knoppix takes on the theme.
