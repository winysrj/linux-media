i raise to the bait every so often :-)

since when was this a competition?

a couple of years ago i bought a device because it was "supported"
then you took you code away and went off and did your own thing

i think that was a really immature thing to do
you could help with efforts here, but you choose not to
either work to add additional functionality to the in-kernel driver or 
just go away

but please (oh please) stop spamming this list with your "help"
