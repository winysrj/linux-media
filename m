Egads.  GStreamer's caps negotiation is already close to unbounded time;
seems like most of the optimisation work that goes into it these days is
all about _reducing_ the complexity of caps negotiation!

Hm, are you sure about that? The answer is yes for 'userspace' as a
broad handwave, but not necessarily for individual processes.  Take, for
instance, media decode through GStreamer, being displayed by Wayland
using a KMS plane/overlay/sprite/cursor/etc.  The media player knows
that the buffers are coming from the decode engine, and Wayland knows
that the buffers are going to a KMS plane, but neither of them knows the
full combination of the two.

Though this kinda feeds into an idea I've been kicking around for a
while, which is an 'optimal hint' mechanism in the Wayland protocol.  So
for our hypothetical dmabuf-using protocol, we'd start off with buffers
which satisfied all the constraints of our media decode engine, but
perhaps just the GPU rather than display controller.  At this point,
we'd note that we could place the video in a plane if only the buffers
were better-allocated, and send an event to the client letting it know
how to tweak its buffer allocation for more optimal display.

But ...

... this is still rather unresolved. ;)
