I'm scratching my head on this one.  Seems the last thing that is needed
is YET another mailing list.  Further, it
- fractures the development community. 
- persons unaware of the decision, and whom might be interested, would
never find it . i.e. alienation
- disinterested parties can simply hit the delete key and not bother
with the message
- blah blah blah ..

PS.  In regards to yesterday's business announcements, I hope your new
forthcoming overlords are as kind to you as your last
