Hi Sylwester,

Great thanks for providing so detailed v4l2 background.

Yes, so it does make sense to implement FD based on v4l2 framework.

I think the working memory is used by FD HW module to run its built-in face
detection algorithm, so that lots of ram can be saved in the module.

I think only output memory buffers are enough for FD device, we can get
the detection result from ioctl, then let application to handle it.

It is very helpful.

If the image data comes from a device(capture device, or resize
post-processing),
face detect module should use the buffer directly and avoid
to copy image data from capture or resize buffer if the image format is
same with what FD requires and the buffer is physical continuous.

But I am not sure how to handle this case? Could we need to add a ioctl to
make FD device see the buffer from capture or resize device?

Also, could you give a introduction about how v4l2 handles resize if
HW is capable of resizing?

Agree.

Agree.

Agree.

It is great for you to provide some information about FD on Samsung SoC,
so that we can figure out a more generic implementation to make support
for new FD IP easier.
