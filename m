So my understanding is that the bridge driver (ISP) will call s_stream
for the CSI-2 receiver, and that in turn calls s_stream of the sensor.

This should only be done for mc-centric devices, so we need a clear
property telling a subdev whether it is part of an mc-centric pipeline
or a devnode-centric pipeline. Since in the latter case it should not
call s_stream in this way. For devnode-centric pipelines the bridge
driver broadcasts s_stream to all subdevs.

For the record, I am not aware of any subdevs that are used by both
mc and devnode-centric scenarios AND that can sit in the middle of a
pipeline. Sensors/video receiver subdevs can certainly be used in both
scenarios, but they don't have to propagate a s_stream call.

It would be very helpful if we have a good description of these two
scenarios in our documentation, and a capability indicating mc-centric
behavior for devnodes. And also for v4l2-subdevs internally (i.e.
am I used in a mc-centric scenario or not?).

Then this documentation will start to make more sense as well.

Yes, and this driver is the one that calls s_stream on the
adjacent subdevs. But just those and not all.

I think you misunderstand what Sakari tries to say.

In the scenario above the bridge driver calls s_stream for the
CSI receiver. That in turn has code like this:

s_stream(bool enable)
{
	... initialize CSI ...
	if error initializing CSI
		return error
	call s_stream for adjacent source subdev (i.e. sensor)
	if success
		return 0
	... de-initialize CSI
	return error
}

This makes a lot of sense for mc-centric devices and is also much more
precise than the broadcast that a devnode-centric device would do.

In the very unlikely case that this CSI subdev would also be used in
a devnode-centric scenario the s_stream implementation would just
return 0 after it initializes the CSI hardware. It will depend on
the hardware whether that works or not.

subdevs used in devnode-centric scenarios tend to be pretty simple
and are able to handle this.
