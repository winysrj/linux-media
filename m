Can't you scroll to the end of the email and insert your message?

Hey Tom,

I spoke with Ben off-list. He has kindly offered to walk you through the clone, 
build and install mechanisms off-list, in other words a little one-to-one help. 
Rather than repeat his email address here, exposing his address, please look 
back through the mailing list and contact him directly.

In the spirit of 'one good turn', if you can spend a few minutes to update the 
hvr-1500 product page on the linuxtv.org wiki 
(http://linuxtv.org/wiki/index.php/Hauppauge_WinTV-HVR-1500) then you'd be 
helping another user in the future :)

- Steve
