Hi Mauro,

I'd like to attend this one (couldn't attend the one last month in San-Diego).
That would be me and possibly another member (Silvano Vigna) also.

Amount various parts we have in our LinuxDVB/V4L2 model that need discussion with you, we would particularly like to discuss about a TSMux (a Mux rather than a demux) device within LinuxTV.

Can you confirm the possibility of our attendance?

Regards,

Alain
