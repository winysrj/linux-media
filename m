Subject: Hauppauge model 73219 rev D1F5 tuner doesn't detect signal, older
 rev D1E9 works

Hi

I have a bunch of Hauppauge HVR-1900 model 73219's, some are revision D1E9 
and work perfectly, but with the newer revision D1F5's the tuner fails to 
detect a signal and consequently just gives me blank output on 
/dev/video0. Other input sources, like composite or s-video, work just 
fine on the new revision, it's just the tuner that does not work.

I'm 100% certain that there is a live signal since I can use the same 
source successfully with a D1E9 and then move it to a D1F5 and see it 
fail. I've also tried both with a real TV signal and with a signal 
generator (so I could be 100% certain what signal was generated and at 
what frequency etc).
I'm also fairly certain that it's not just a case of a random broken 
D1F5 since I have several and they all behave identically (and the driver 
doesn't complain about broken hardware).

Here's what I get in dmesg when plugging one of the newer, non-working, 
devices into my laptop (running 2.6.39.3 by the way):

The only differences between this output and a working device is the 
revision number and the fact that the tuner is a TDA18271HD/C2 whereas 
with the older (working) devices it's a TDA18271HD/C1.

Here's what I do to test problem:
[root@dragon ~]# echo television > /sys/class/pvrusb2/sn-6569758/ctl_input/cur_val 
[root@dragon ~]# echo 140250000 > /sys/class/pvrusb2/sn-6569758/ctl_frequency/cur_val 
[root@dragon ~]# cat /sys/class/pvrusb2/sn-6569758/ctl_signal_present/cur_val 
0
[root@dragon ~]# 

If I now do 'cat /dev/video0 > test.mpg' I get a perfectly valid MPEG 
stream, but a rather boring one - just a black display and no audio.

With the old D1E9 revision I get

[root@dragon ~]# cat /sys/class/pvrusb2/sn-6569758/ctl_signal_present/cur_val
65535
[root@dragon ~]#

and 'cat /dev/video0 > test.mpg' gives me the stream I'd expect (as in 
actual contents, not just a black screen).

Any ideas on how to fix this?

I can test any patches you may come up with and if there's any further 
information you need from me in order to get an idea about what the 
problem is, then just ask.
