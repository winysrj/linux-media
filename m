CMA does not handle that well right now.  I guess it's something to think about
once the rest is nice and working.

I'm not entirely sure of what you mean here.

This is sort of an artefact of my misunderstanding of pcp lists in the
past.  I'll have to re-evaluate the decision not to include CMA on pcp
list.

Still, I think that CMA not being on pcp lists should not be a problem
for us.  At least we can try and get CMA running and then consider adding
CMA to pcp lists.

I've addressed it in my other mail where I've changed the split_free_page()
to not touch CMA and ISOLATE pageblocks.  I think that this change should
make the above comment no longer accurate and the check unnecessary.

It changes a sort of a magic number into a value that is calculated
 from the array.  This makes it resistant to changes in the definition
of the fallbacks array.  I think this is a reasonable change.
