PHY object is not a device, it is something that a device driver creates 
(one or more instances of) when it is being probed. You don't have a clean 
way to export this PHY object to other driver, other than keeping this PHY 
on a list inside PHY core with some well-known ID (e.g. device name + 
consumer port name/index, like in regulator core) and then to use this 
well-known ID inside consumer driver as a lookup key passed to phy_get();

Actually I think for PHY case, exactly the same way as used for regulators 
might be completely fine:

1. Each PHY would have some kind of platform, non-unique name, that is 
just used to print some messages (like the platform/board name of a 
regulator).
2. Each PHY would have an array of consumers. Consumer specifier would 
consist of consumer device name and consumer port name - just like in 
regulator subsystem.
3. PHY driver receives an array of, let's say, phy_init_data inside its 
platform data that it would use to register its PHYs.
4. Consumer drivers would have constant consumer port names and wouldn't 
receive any information about PHYs from platform code.

Code example:

[Board file]

static const struct phy_consumer_data usb_20_phy0_consumers[] = {
	{
		.devname = "foo-ehci",
		.port = "usbphy",
	},
};

static const struct phy_consumer_data usb_20_phy1_consumers[] = {
	{
		.devname = "foo-otg",
		.port = "otgphy",
	},
};

static const struct phy_init_data my_phys[] = {
	{
		.name = "USB 2.0 PHY 0",
		.consumers = usb_20_phy0_consumers,
		.num_consumers = ARRAY_SIZE(usb_20_phy0_consumers),
	},
	{
		.name = "USB 2.0 PHY 1",
		.consumers = usb_20_phy1_consumers,
		.num_consumers = ARRAY_SIZE(usb_20_phy1_consumers),
	},
	{ }
};

static const struct platform_device usb_phy_pdev = {
	.name = "foo-usbphy",
	.id = -1,
	.dev = {
		.platform_data = my_phys,
	},
};

[PHY driver]

static int foo_usbphy_probe(pdev)
{
	struct foo_usbphy *foo;
	struct phy_init_data *init_data = pdev->dev.platform_data;
	/* ... */
	// for each PHY in init_data {
		phy_register(&foo->phy[i], &init_data[i]);
	// }
	/* ... */
}

[EHCI driver]

static int foo_ehci_probe(pdev)
{
	struct phy *phy;
	/* ... */
	phy = phy_get(&pdev->dev, "usbphy");
	/* ... */
}

[OTG driver]

static int foo_otg_probe(pdev)
{
	struct phy *phy;
	/* ... */
	phy = phy_get(&pdev->dev, "otgphy");
	/* ... */
}

With Device Tree we don't have board files anymore. How would you pass any 
pointers between provider and consumer drivers in this case?

Yes, the clock API has a problem related to the clock namespace being 
global for all registered clock controllers. This is not a problem with 
lookup in general, but with wrong lookup key chosen.
