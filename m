I agree with you that most of the content of the remote endpoint should=
 be=20
considered private to the remote device and not accessed by the local d=
evice=20
driver. There is, however, one piece of information from the remote end=
point=20
useful to the local device driver, it's the remote port identifier. Thi=
s can=20
be expressed by a phandle, a remote port number, a media entity pad poi=
nter,=20
or any other mean, but the information is useful for the local device d=
river=20
to communicate with the remote device driver. For instance a driver cou=
ld use=20
it to ask its video stream source to start the video stream on a given =
port.
