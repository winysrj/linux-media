No, but we have patches for all of them.

If you take a look at the code, you'll see that all code is at cx88xx. This
module is loaded by cx8800, if you're using analog, or by cx8802, if you're
using cx88-dvb or cx88-blackbird.

The code initializes xc3028 before tuner attach.

The proper fix is to open the i2c gate before loading tuner. This will allow
i2c_scan to work and both analog and digital modes will work. Btw, this
somewhat similar to what dvico_fusionhdtv_hybrid_init() does on cx88-cards.

I've added a patch that should open the bridge for s5h1409. Please test.

It would be really nice to avoid having to attach it later, on cx88-dvb,
although the double attach won't hurt. I'm not sure on how you want to avoid
this.
