The OMAP 3 ISP driver I'm familiar with uses the OMAP 3 IOMMU / IOVMM API
which is to be replaced by dmabuf. I'm trying to understand how the dma
api / dma-buf should be used to achieve a superset of that functionality.

I think I'm interested in the DMA mapping API. I replied to Sumit's new
patchset, you're cc'd.

Do you mean the memory would be non-cacheable? Accessing memory w/o caching
is typically prohibitively expensive, so I don't think this could ever be
the primary means to do the above.

In some cases non-cacheable can perform better, taking into account the time
which is required for flusing the cache and the other consequences of that,
but I still think it's more of an exception than a rule.

I think in general creating unused mappings should really be avoided.
Creating them consumes time, effort at creation time and possibly also in
cache related operations.

That also depend on the buffer size and what the rest of the system is
doing. I could imagine buffer size, system memory data rate, CPU frequency,
cache line width and the properties of the cache all affect how fast both of
the operations are.

It would probably be possible to perform a heuristic analysis on this at
system startup similar to different software raid algorithm implementations
( e.g. to use MMX or SSE for sw raid).

Some additional complexity will arise from the fact that on some ARM machines
one must know all the CPU MMU mappings pointing to a piece of physical
memory to properly flush them, AFAIR. Naturally a good alternative on such
system is to pperform full dcache flush / cleaning.

Also, cache handling only affects systems without coherent cache. ARM CPUs
are finding their ways to servers as well, but I'd guess it'll still take a
while before we have ARM CPUs with 64 MiB of cache..

Kind regards,
