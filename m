OK, so I knew I had considered this strategy before, I did and here's
the recap:

I originally had proposed this same exact thing with my first patch set but [0]
had set to require a new __arch_phys_wc_add() which forces the setting without
checking if pat_enabled() is true. This was set out as a transient API in hopes
that device drivers that require work but hadn't been converted to split the
ioremap'd calls would later be modified / fixed with the split. Here's an
update for the status of each driver:

Driver          File
------------------------------------------------------------
fusion          drivers/message/fusion/mptbase.c
  This code was commented out, the code was just removed, this longer applies.

ivtv            drivers/media/pci/ivtv/ivtvfb.c
  The firmware sucks, it does not expose the WC area, and likely we won't be able to
  do the split, the work for it is simply not worth the effort. This driver is old
  for an old DVR setup.

ipath           drivers/infiniband/hw/ipath/ipath_driver.c
   I did an evaluation of the work required and its significant, discussions
   are ongoing about just removing the driver from v4.3.

When originally proposed __arch_phys_wc_add() Andy Luto ended up requesting to
consider instead using ioremap_nocache() and then set_memory_wc() but Toshi
noted to me that was not possible as set_memory_wc() cannot work on IO memory
because:

--
1. __pa(addr) returns a fake address since there is no direct map.
2. reserve_memtype() tracks regular memory and I/O memory differently.

For regular memory, set_memory_*() can modify WB with a new type since
reserve_memtype() does not track WB.  For I/O memory, reserve_memtype()
detects a conflict when a given type is different from a tracked type.
--

Given the changes above and the issue with set_memory_wc() another
possibility is to do overlapping ioremap calls but one issue there was
the aliasing possible issues and no one seemed to know WTF would happen
for sure. After considering the overlapping ioremap() call strategy,
since only 3 drivers were affected (we have fixed atyfb with
iorenmap_uc() solution) since it really was only 2 drivers that needed
a work around and they were both for old devices it seems me and Andy
preferred to just treat them specially and I guess what we decided
in the end to do was to just not add transient APIs [1] but instead
that boot thing this thread talks about and which got merged.

So in light of all this review now: I am not sure its worth to remove
the pat_enabled() check from arch_phys_wc_add() or to just warn about
it. If we really wanted to we could consider arch_phys_wc_add() and
deal with that this will not check for pat_enabled() and forces MTRR...
I think Andy Luto won't like that very much though ? I at least don't
like it since we did all this work to finally leave only 1 piece of
code with direct MTRR access... Seems a bit sad. Since ipath will
be removed we'd have only ivtv driver using this API, I am not sure if
its worth it.

Thoughts?
