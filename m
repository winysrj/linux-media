I work on both lirc and media tree drivers. In this case, lircd is doing
exactly the right thing with the data its being fed, the bug is in the
kernel driver, which is from the media tree. Best to discuss the bug on
the list for the layer at which it exists. :)

(No cable yet, still awaiting its arrival).
