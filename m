I just created a repository on my personal github account to keep the
patches [1] and make it more easily accessible to people that want to
try.
These already have the fix to the fact that ccdc_input_is_fldmode()
was returning pdata->bt655 instead of pdata->fldmode.

I will try to test the patches tomorrow when I have access to the
hardware but I can't promise because I have lots of other tasks to do.
