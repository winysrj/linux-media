Just a quick note: Manu is right at least here in the French Caribbean 
Islands where, under the pretext of streaming more HD channels, 
CanalSat Caraibes (which is strongly affiliated with Canal+ France) is 
broadcasting DVB-S2 QPSK 45 MSPS. People are really upset about it 
because it basically boils down to lock everybody into renting their 
decoder.
So yes, some people (read me ;-) desperately needs DVB-S2 HW supporting 
high SPS rates (plus I need CI also). For now I dont see this rare 
bird! If someone knows one with good linux driver...
