Me too.  We use BUG_ON in the I/O subsystem where we're forced to
violate a guarantee.  When the choice is corrupt something or panic the
system, I prefer the latter every time.

I'd say it depends on the consequence of the assertion violation.  We
have assertions that are largely theoretical, ones that govern process
internal state (so killing the process mostly sanitizes the system) and
a few that imply data loss or data corruption.
