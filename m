But (1) makes even less sense :-) The issue here is that MC-enabled drivers 
will use pad-level subdev operations, so those operations need to be 
implemented in subdev drivers used by MC-enabled hosts/bridges. I don't like 
the idea of having two sets of similar operations in subdevs, as that will 
result in duplicate code. We should thus implement only pad-level subdev 
operations for MC-aware subdevs (a wrapper method can be implemented in the 
code to convert video operations to subdev operations transparently for non 
MC-aware hosts/bridges). This requires media_entity_init() and 
media_entity_cleanup() being available to those subdev drivers regardless of 
whether the host/bridge exposes the MC API to userspace.

I don't mind splitting the config option. An alternative would be to compile 
media_entity_init() and media_entity_cleanup() based on CONFIG_MEDIA_SUPPORT 
instead of CONFIG_MEDIA_CONTROLLER, but that looks a bit hackish to me.

We don't have to convert them all in one go right now, we can implement pad-
level operations support selectively when a subdev driver becomes used by an 
MC-enabled host/bridge driver.
