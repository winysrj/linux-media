Right, that will work.

This remains problematic since I believe this should be done as a list
of properties. Instead the entity type would be ENT_T_HW (if it represents
actual hardware), ENT_T_SW (if it is a software implementation, for example
for the DVB demux if there is no HW demux), and perhaps ENT_T_IP for
representing IP blocks (not sure about this one).

And the properties will tell what functions it supports.

The existing 2 << 16 defines would only be used if the property list matches
the original meaning of the define to keep it backwards compatible.

I see this as a property as well, but otherwise I agree with this.

Why? A hardware component that can be controlled via a v4l-subdev node
would be linked to an entity for that v4l-subdev node. That's an API
entity. The whole 'is this a v4l-subdev' question disappears, since that
is now no longer relevant. Instead you will have an ENT_T_DEVNODE_V4L_SUBDEV
entity linked to the hw entity.

Even a radio device would fit cleanly into this: the tuner entity simply
has a link to a radio device node entity.

Hmm, does this also solve the control vs DMA issue? If a DEVNODE entity
is hooked up to an entity with the DMA functionality, then you can stream,
otherwise it is just for control.

I'm not sure if this is always true, though. Of course, we can also just
add the streaming/dma property to the DEVNODE entity as well.

We can interpret the existing ENT_T_HW_TUNER etc. as shorthand for a
property while the property API isn't there yet (we need that anyway
for backwards compat).

So we would need to add a ENT_T_HW_DMA as well (to be replaced by a
property later).

Basically I see the 1 << 16 range as device node types, the 2 << 16 range
as shorthands for what should be properties (this really defined functions
and entities can combine multiple functions), and we would need to have a
new range (4 << 16) for non-DEVNODE entity types. Although we could keep
it in range 1 << 16 as well, but I think it might make sense to keep it
separate.

And there you would get ENT_T_HW/SW/IP (not sure about the last one). And
perhaps FPGA.

Again, just brainstorming here.
