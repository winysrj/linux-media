Hans,

I did this in my driver,
--- a/drivers/media/radio/wl128x/fmdrv_v4l2.c
+++ b/drivers/media/radio/wl128x/fmdrv_v4l2.c
@@ -477,7 +477,7 @@ static const struct v4l2_file_operations fm_drv_fops = {
        .read = fm_v4l2_fops_read,
        .write = fm_v4l2_fops_write,
        .poll = fm_v4l2_fops_poll,
-       .ioctl = video_ioctl2,
+       .unlocked_ioctl = video_ioctl2,
        .open = fm_v4l2_fops_open,
        .release = fm_v4l2_fops_release,

and apparently didn't face any issues during regression.. (related to
concurrency...)
and more-over all of my ioctls from the application being called in
process context are all synchronous, i.e
application calls and waits for it to finish before calling another ioctl.

So is this approach alright?
Is there a reason to opt for the .ioctl ? The locked approach?
Or have mutex locks inside the unlocked handlers?

If not I will go ahead and submit v8 using the unlocked_ioctl....
