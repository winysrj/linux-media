Hello,

is this the right place to ask?
sorry, i read lots of internet sites, tried a lot of things, and got a
bit confused.
so i hope this is the right place...

my technotrend usb s2 3600 worked fine with s2-liplianin and ubuntu
lucid lynx.

but then it did not work anymore.
it happened a few weeks ago, i am not sure but I think there was an
update of the kernel-headers.

the device itself is ok, i checked it on windows.

does anyone has a hint?

thanks a lot in advance!

beste gruesse
jochen
