The changes done for usb/em28xx might come close. That said, the cx25821 is already in
decent shape to convert to vb2. At least the videobuf data structures are already in the
correct place (they are often stored in a per-filehandle struct, which is wrong).

include/media/videobuf2-core.h gives a reasonable overview of vb2. Like em28xx, you
should use the vb2 helper functions (vb2_fop_* and vb2_ioctl_*) which takes a lot
of the work off your hands.

Converting cx25821-alsa.c may be the most difficult part as it is using some videobuf
internal functions which probably won't translate to vb2 as is. I think videobuf is
being abused here, but I don't know off-hand what the correct approach will be with
vb2.

I would ignore the alsa part for the time being (also the audio/video-upstream code,
that's been disabled and without datasheets of the cx25821 I'm not sure it can be
resurrected).

If you can get cx25821-video.c to work with vb2, then we can take a look at the alsa
code.
