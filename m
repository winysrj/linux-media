peripheral

I *really* don't like the term "hardware peripheral". For me that means a
mouse, keyboard, printer, webcam, i.e. some external device that you connect
to a USB bus or similar, but it makes no sense as a definition of an
SoC + sensor(s) hardware design.

I would simple define "V4L2 hardware" as consisting of 1 or more "V4L2 hardware
components".

I think we should mention that the V4L2 device nodes are responsible for
implementing streaming (if applicable) of data.

Again, I prefer the term "V4L2 hardware control".

add 'control' at the end.

to know -> know

Actually, I would rephrase this to:

in order to inform the application which device nodes are available

... settings of the corresponding hardware components.

I agree with Laurent that I don't think this summary is needed. I would drop
it for v5 and we can look at the text again and see if it needs more work to
clarify things.

The main thing here is that the note about the V4L2 device node being responsible
for controlling the streaming features is mentioned when the V4L2 device node is
introduced above, since this is true for both MC and vdev-centric HW control.
