Hi Hans, thanks for response.

I'm not proficient in linux kernel, so it's hard to make sure and
strict statements regarding this.

In the commit justification I mean that solo_ring_thread(), which is
edited, runs in a thread started with kthread_run().
Interrupt hander is executed on random kernel thread (whichever is
currently running, is it correct?). So temporarily disabling
interrupts from video encoders by writing to special register cannot
be used for "processing serialization", for "fixation of state" or
anything useful at all, thus it should be removed from code.

Is it clear now?

Please feel free to push the patch with edited description, even
without resubmission from me.
