Hello Guys,

I have one of these "paper weights" - that is a S350 , it has been 
sitting on the shelf for the past 2 years . And I would really like to 
use it . We have a driver for it here : 
http://article.gmane.org/gmane.linux.drivers.dvb/38163  . Please what 
needs to be done to get this driver merged into the tree ? C'mon guys 
lets get this one in .

Best Regards
Milorad
