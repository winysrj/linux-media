I'm thinking for a first version, we can get enough mileage out of it by saying:
1) only exporter can mmap to userspace
2) only importers that do not need CPU access to buffer..

This way we can get dmabuf into the kernel, maybe even for 3.3.  I
know there are a lot of interesting potential uses where this stripped
down version is good enough.  It probably isn't the final version,
maybe more features are added over time to deal with importers that
need CPU access to buffer, sync object, etc.  But we have to start
somewhere.
