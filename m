Subject: Skipping commercials?

Hello,

I would like to skip commercials in my dvb recordings.

I know mythtv has some methods but I don't really want the hassle of
mythtv setup and use. It is relatively early stage software and
besides, I prefer to have a normal window-based UI. I use kaffeine and
except for absence of commercial skipping, like it.

Ideally I would want a program to run on an already existing
recording, to mark or cut out ads.

A Windows program, comskip, exists. It is closed source and its
configuration seems opaque. I will still try it under wine, but
perhaps there is a better way?
