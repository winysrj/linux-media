I'm afraid you have entered half way through a conversation, which as
caused a misunderstanding.  Apologies for not being clear in my commit
log.

When I say "this is how it's done else where", that is in reference to
offering stubs which can be tucked away in a header file, rather than
being forced to #if out any functionality which is not available.

Continued on from my last point:

What I do not mean is that this solution is perfect and does not
require a review.  You are completely correct in what you say, the
return values I have used are not suitable.  I failed to see how
callers were treating the return value.  I will carry out due
diligence on that point and re-submit as per your request.

Fair point Russell.  Thanks, will fix.
