Media subsystem workshop 2011 - Prague - Oct 24-26

Since 2007, we're doing annual mini-summits for the media subsystem,
in order to plan the new features that will be introduced there.

Last year, during the Kernel Summit 2010, it was decided that the Kernel 
Summit 2011 format will be modified, in order to strength the interaction 
between the several sub-system mini-summits and the main Kernel Summit. 
If this idea works well, the next Kernel Summits will also follow the
same format.

So, some mini-summits were proposed to happen together with the Kernel
Summit 2011. Among a few others, the Media subsystem was accepted to be
held with this year's Kernel Summit.

So, we'd like to announce that the Media subsystem workshop 2011 will
happen together with the Kernel Summit 2011.

The Media subsystem workshop is on early planning stages, but the idea
is that we'll have an entire day to do the media discussions. We'll 
also planning to have workshop presentations inside the Kernel Summit
2011 with the workshop and Kernel Summit attendants present, where 
workshop results will be presented.

So, I'd like to invite V4L, DVB and RC developers to submit proposals
for the themes to be discussed. Please email me if you're interested
on being invited for the event.

Hoping to see you soon there!
Mauro
