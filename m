I haven't really looked at Dave's latest prime patches, but he reported
some reference counting issues last time around we chatted about it on
irc. So maybe you're just right and the dma_buf_put is indeed missing from
drm_prime_gem_destroy ;-) But as I've said, haven't really reviewed the
code, so I'm likely completely wrong.
