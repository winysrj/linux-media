Yes a separate kernel level interface.

Well I'd like to keep it even simpler. dmabuf is a buffer sharing API,
shoehorning in a sw mapping API isn't making it simpler.

The problem I have with implementing mmap on the sharing fd, is that
nothing says this should be purely optional and userspace shouldn't
rely on it.

In the Intel GEM space alone you have two types of mapping, one direct
to shmem one via GTT, the GTT could be even be a linear view. The
intel guys initially did GEM mmaps direct to the shmem pages because
it seemed simple, up until they
had to do step two which was do mmaps on the GTT copy and ended up
having two separate mmap methods. I think the problem here is it seems
deceptively simple to add this to the API now because the API is
simple, however I think in the future it'll become a burden that we'll
have to workaround.

Dave.
