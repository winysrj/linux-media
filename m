Hi Devin,

Did you mean G_INPUT and G_STD here? I didn't see G_TUNER mentioned
below in the use-case.

I didn't know this use-case, I did notice ENUM_INPUT getting called
in a loop during testing. I think I didn't run into this because I
changed the au0828: vidioc_g_tuner to hold the lock as it does a tuner
init and messes up the tuner when it is in use by dvb. But, that doesn't
cover this use-case for other drivers. So I need to make more changes
to cover it. Thanks for pointing this out.

I am missing vb2 streamon change to hold the tuner in this patch set.
Without that change vb2 work isn't complete. Unfortunately I don't
have hybrid hardware that uses a vb2 driver.

I think this use-case will be covered with changes to vb2 streamon
to check and hold tuner. I am thinking it might not be necessary to
change g_tuner, g_std, g_input and enum_input at v4l2-core level.
Does that sounds right??
