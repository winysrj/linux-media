Hello Enrico,

Yes, I saw it. That is why I didn't post our modifications to the ISP
CCDC driver. Our approach is very similar to the one followed by TI
(changing the CCDC output buffer every two VD0 interrupts) but we did
different a few things:

- decouple next buffer obtaining from last buffer releasing
- maintain two buffers (struct isp_buffer), current and last
- move move most of the logic to the VD1 interrupt since the ISP is
already busy while execution VD0 handler.

Yes, now I saw that you already posted this, sorry for not doing a
correct mail archive browsing before posting the patch.

Ok, I thought it was the right thing to do, my bad. Lets do it from
user-space then using the MCF.
