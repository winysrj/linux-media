hola,

i work a lot with computer vision and would very much like to use a camcorder as
a V4L2 device - ie as a high-quality 'webcam' - over the USB bus. 

i am looking at a variety of camcorders but have found very little reliable
information as to which, if any, allow for stream playback at native capture
sizes, let alone as raw frames. instead i see complaints of high quality
camcorders yielding only 320x240.

is there a site, or any advice/experience, someone on this list could provide me
to these ends?

i do not have a FireWire port on my laptops but would consider a PCI express
adaptor to allow for capture in this manner as a second option.

cheers,
