Not to me. VIDEO_OVERLAY just defines where the overlay is. But the actual 
framerate is entirely dependent on the VIDEO_CAPTURE framerate. Just keep 
to the spec for now. If a new driver appears that needs it then we can 
always change it.

No, I agree with the spec in that I see no use case for it. Should there be 
one, then I'd like to see that in an actual driver implementation and in 
that case the spec should be adjusted as well.

In addition, g/s_parm is only used in combination with webcams/sensors for 
which overlays and vbi are irrelevant.

I saw that. So why not check for s_fmt instead of try_fmt? That would solve 
this potential problem.
