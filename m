many thanks for your time and help.

Ah. Derek please take some credits.

I suspected him to be a troll only, since for more than two years
he refused to provide at least a full name. There was also no single patch with a valid SOB.

This has changed now and there should be no reasons for any further clashes.

His temper and harshness, when me was insisting on a full name, 
did always remind me on Uwe, who is using multiple email accounts 
on his attempts to "improve" development.

If you trust him, I'll trust him too.

Derek, sorry for have being preemptive on you.

Thanks,
Hermann
