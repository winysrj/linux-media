One word: scripts/checkpatch.pl

In other news, the above is just plain wrong. First we force people to
read the result of bus_for_each_drv() and then when they do and don't
need the value, gcc complains, so we add one more layer of useless
code, which developers and possibly tools will later wonder and
complain about? I can easily imagine that a static code analyzer would
spot the above code as being a potential bug.

Let's stop this madness now please.

Either __must_check goes away from bus_for_each_drv() and from every
other function which raises this problem, or we must disable that new
type of warning gcc 4.6.0 generates. Depends which warnings we value
more, as we can't sanely have both.
