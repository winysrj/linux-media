But that's a Linux infrastrcture issue, no? You don't have to use the
node from the struct device to find the relevant phandle.

While that might be convenient, I don't think it's fantastic to use that
to describe the relationship, as this leaks Linux internals (e.g. I can
refer to a name that doesn't exist in the DT but happens to be what
Linux used, and it would work). Also, are the labels guaranteed to be
globally unique?

Using phandles is much better for the binding. I appreciate that this
may require more code, but IMO it's worth that for the safety and
uniformity given by the use of phandles for referring to nodes.

Thanks!
