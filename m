Still haven't had the time to check this, other than a very quick test run.
Don't worry, it's in my TODO list, so I can't forget, but it has been busier
than usual lately. And this is one patch I really like to test before
committing.

Fingers crossed that I might be able to do it either tomorrow or on Monday.
If that fails, then the next opportunity will be after Christmas as I won't
have access to the hardware for awhile.

Regards,

	Hans
