Hi all,
I have recently contacted TBS support to see if they have new products, 
and they do have something in the pipeline: the 6921 and 8921, about to 
be released, IIRC end of november. I am interested in whicether that has 
good linux support. On this link you can check the specs and chips:

They say they have linux drivers but I would like to make sure they are 
good and reliable.
If anyone here could tell me if these are supported or about to be. I am 
prepared to do some testing reporting, time permitting.
TIA
Bye
Manu
