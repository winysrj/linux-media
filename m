6 channels with SMIT? You are lucky, the most I have ever gotten is 5 ( actually 11 pids ).

Aston claims they can do 12 services (24 pids) the most I have ever gotten out of them is 17 pids (actually 16 pids working well and one more glitching pid)

I have also tested PowerCAM - same story, can actually do about 2/3 of what they claim.

I have S-1500 + CI installed at openSuse PC , used with SMIT Pro CAM thats
suppose to descramble 8 channels at same time. I am not able to get more
than 6 channels. Smit claimed that is a limitation of the CI, I also tried
OneCam Infinite (8 channels too), same results.



I have contact technoTrend and below is their reply:



*it's not a limitation of the CI, as it's a "silly device", just parsing the
stream over CAM. Maybe it's a limitation in Linux drivers, which we don't
support, due to open source. Maybe you get in touch with the Linux community
first ...*





Any Body can help?



Thanks
