We will investigate this API further. From the first sight it looks it won't take
much work to port/rewrite our driver to fit into iommu.h API.

Well creating a portable iommu framework and merging it with dma-mapping interface
looks like a much harder (and time consuming) task. There is definitely a need for
it. I hope that it can be developed incrementally starting from the current iommu.h
and dma-mapping.h interfaces. Please note that there might be some subtle differences
in the hardware that such framework must be aware. The first obvious one is the
hardware design. Some platform has central iommu unit, other (like Samsung Exynos4)
has a separate iommu unit per each device driver (this is still a simplification,
because a video codec device has 2 memory interfaces and 2 iommu units). Currently
I probably have not enough knowledge to predict the other possible issues that need
to be taken into account in the portable and generic iommu/dma-mapping frame-work.

ARM dma-mapping framework also requires some additional research for better DMA
support (there are still issues with multiple mappings to be resolved).
