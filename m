Hi Mauro,

I have a Hauppauge Bt878 card with radio tuner. Recent kernels can switch
between TV channels, but the tuner fails for radio. If no channel had been
previously selected, choosing a radio program yields white noise. Otherwise,
if a TV channel was previously selected, I can always hear the previous TV
channel audio, no matter what radio station I tune to.

I've bisected the problem. The commit that breaks things is:

    [media] tuner-core: Better implement standby mode
   =20
    In the past, T_STANDBY were used on devices with a separate radio tuner=
 to
    mark a tuner that were disabled. With the time, it got newer meanings.
   =20
    Also, due to a bug at the logic, the driver might incorrectly return
    T_STANDBY to userspace.
   =20
    So, instead of keeping the abuse, just use a boolean for storing
    such information.
   =20
    We can't remove T_STANDBY yet, as this is used on two other drivers. A
    latter patch will address its usage outside tuner-core.
   =20
