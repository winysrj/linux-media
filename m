I don't think ISPs typically implement test patterns. Do you know of any?

Should we separate controls which clearly apply to sensors only from the
rest?

For sensors only:

- Analog gain(s)
- Horizontal and vertical blanking
- Link frequency
- Test pattern

The following can be implemented also on ISPs:

- Per-component gains
- Black level compensation

Do we have more to add to the list?

If we keep the two the same class, I could propose the following names:

V4L2_CTRL_CLASS_LL_CAMERA (for low level camera)
V4L2_CTRL_CLASS_SOURCE
V4L2_CTRL_CLASS_IMAGE_SOURCE

The last one would be a good name for the sensor control class, as far as I
understand some are using tuners with the OMAP 3 ISP these days. For the
another one, I propose V4L2_CTRL_CLASS_ISP.

Better names are always welcome. :-)
