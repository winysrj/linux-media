What I noticed was that I was seeing a few too many green screens
and I had to re-tune xawtv when the timeout code is in place. My
thinking was that this timeout handling could be introducing blank
green frames when there is no need. However, I can't reproduce the
problem on 3.19-rc4 base which is what I am using to test the changes
to the patch series. Hence, I am not positive if the timeout code
indeed was doing anything bad.

I am seeing tvtime hangs.

I will resend the patch with the updated commit log knowing full well
that it might not be accepted.

I do have to re-cut the patch after the changes to address your
comments on the vb2 conversion patch. It applies, with fuzz, so
I decided to re-cut the patch.
