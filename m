Sorry for the late reply, but KS and LPC got in the way.

Also added kbuild to the Cc.

What about just changing it to:

#if defined(CONFIG_DVB_DIB3000MC) ||
		defined(CONFIG_DVB_DIB3000MC_MODULE)

Looking at the kbuild system scripts/Makefile.lib we have:

# When an object is listed to be built compiled-in and modular,
# only build the compiled-in version

obj-m := $(filter-out $(obj-y),$(obj-m))

So if this is defined as both a module and builtin, the module version
will never be built. Then we need that code in that #if block
regardless. No need for testing the define(MODULE).

Or we just don't test for define(MODULE). If either CONFIG_DVB_DIB3000MC
or CONFIG_DVB_DIB3000MC_MODULE are defined, the code must be there,
because, if this code is built as both a module and builtin, only the
builtin will be created.
