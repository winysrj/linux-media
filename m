Subject: [PATCH 0/3] A driver for Si476x series of chips
Date: Thu, 13 Sep 2012 15:40:10 -0700
Message-Id: <1347576013-28832-1-git-send-email-andrey.smirnov@convergeddevices.net>

This patchset contains a driver for a Silicon Laboratories 476x series
of radio tuners. The driver itself is implemented as an MFD devices
comprised of three parts:
 1. Core device that provides all the other devices with basic
 functionality and locking scheme.
 2. Radio device that translates between V4L2 subsystem requests into
 Core device commands.
 3. Codec device that does similar to the earlier described task, but
 for ALSA SoC subsystem.

This driver has been tested to work in two different sytems:
 1. A custom Tegra-based ARM board(design is based on Harmony board)
 running linux kernel 3.1.10 kernel
 2. A standalone USB-connected board that has a dedicated Cortex M3
 working as a transparent USB to I2C bridge which was connected to a
 off-the-shelf x86-64 laptop running Ubuntu with 3.2.0 kernel.

As far as SubmitChecklist is concerned following criteria should be
satisfied: 2b, 3, 5, 7, 9, 10

Andrey Smirnov (3):
  Add a core driver for SI476x MFD
  Add a V4L2 driver for SI476X MFD
  Add a codec driver for SI476X MFD
