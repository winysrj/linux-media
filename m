Hi!



Does anyone know something about this card?



http://www.media-pointer.de/index.php?page=shop.product_details&flypage=flypage.tpl&product_id=6&category_id=3&option=com_virtuemart&Itemid=1



I think this card is a type of the reference design from micronas (think of

the year 2006??).

(Sorry, all in german)



I send a request to the manufacturer and asked what chips are used on the

card. When I get an answer I will post it here.



If this card hast the STB0899/6100 chip, i think it should work with S2-API

repository of Igor Liplianin or Manu Abraham???

Do you think I can use both tuner "out of the box" with these drivers??



Thanks for your information!



Jens
