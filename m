Actually these both should not be in this patch in the first place.

Count them. It is.

How many patches do I need to do for one trivial change? :-(.

Ok.

I don't see what you mean.

Feel free to clean that that up in followup patch.

Lets do that in followup patch, if needed.

Another patch, if someone needs it, yes.
