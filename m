Hi Ming,

It's maybe late, but I want to suggest one thing about FD API.

This OMAP FD block looks detection ability of just face.
But, It's possible to occur another device which can detect
specific "object" or "patterns". Moreover, this API can expand
"object recognition" area. So, I think it's good to change the API name
like "v4l2_recog".

Actually, I'm preparing similar control class for mainline with m5mols
camera sensor driver. The m5mols camera sensor has the function about
"face detection". But, I has experienced about Robot Recognition, and I
remember the image processing chip which can detect spefic "pattern".
So, I hesitated naming the API(control or ioctl whatever) with "face".
It can be possible to provide just "object" or "pattern", not face.
Even user library on windows, there is famous "OpenCV". And this is also
support not only "face", but also "object".

The function of OMAP FDIF looks like m5mols ISP's one.
please understand I don't have experience about OMAP AP. But, I can tell
you it's better to use the name "object recognition", not the "face detection",
for any other device or driver.

In a few days, I'll share the CIDs I have thought for m5mols driver.
And, I hope to discuss about this with OMAP FDIF.

Thank you.

Regards,
Heungjun Kim
