How much are you looking for -- in other words, do you need
the full service including video that a RedButton service
might bring up, or do you just need a sample of, well,
Digital Teletext?

I'm assuming that you're in Italia (based on your mail
headers).  Therefore you likely would have problems in
receiving television programming via satellite on Astra
2D, although I've had error-free reception with a 60cm
dish in Zuerich long before I was aware of the spotbeam.

However, the BBC radio services are on a pan-european beam
and also (since some months) include a minimal MHEG
application that I've been able to receive and view, like
the BBCi services on the TV channels -- also available
from the BBC (if not ITV too) via satellite/Freesat, and
which is likely to be pretty much identical with that
received via Freeview...


So, unless you've received off-list assistance, this may
be a possibility to get something
