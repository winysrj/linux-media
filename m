Should we just restrict such drivers to only be able to build on UP
machines with preempt disabled so that the BKL could be safely removed
from them?

Or what other idea do you have as to what could be done here?

I do have access to this hardware, but its on an old single processor
laptop, so any work that it would take to help do this development,
really wouldn't be able to be tested to be valid at all.
