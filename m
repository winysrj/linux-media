Thanks for the comments. I'll answer from my point of view, which may be
different than Philipp's.

The direction of the dataflow depends on the case. For camera, the data
flows from external components towards the SoC. For display, vice versa.
I don't know much about camera, but for display there are bi-directional
buses, like MIPI DBI and MIPI DSI. However, in those cases, the main
flow direction is clear, towards the display.

Then again, these are meant to be generic graph bindings, and the
dataflow could be fully bi-directional.

As for the driver model (does it matter when we are talking about DT
bindings?), I think there are very different opinions. My thought for
display is that there is always an overarching driver, something that
manages the video pipeline as a whole.

However, each of the individual drivers in the video pipeline will
control its input ports. So, say, a panel driver gets a command from the
overarching control driver to enable the panel device. The panel driver
reacts by calling the encoder (i.e. the one that outputs pixels to the
panel), commanding it to enable the video stream.

I know some (many?) people think the other way around, that the encoder
commands the panel to enable itself. I don't think that's versatile
enough. As a theoretical, slightly exaggerated, example, we could have a
panel that wants the pixel clock to be enabled for a short while before
enabling the actual pixel stream. And maybe the panel driver needs to do
something before the pixel stream is enabled (say, send a command to the
panel).

The above is very easy to do if the panel driver is in control of the
received video stream. It's rather difficult to do if the encoder is in
control.

Also, I think a panel (or any encoder) can be compared to a display
controller: a display controller uses DMA to transfer pixel data from
the memory to the display controller. A panel or encoder uses the
incoming video bus to transfer pixel data from the previous display
component to the panel or encoder device. And I don't think anyone says
the DMA driver should be in control of the display controller.

But this is going quite a bit into the SW architecture. Does it matter
when we are talking about the representation of HW in the DT data?

Yes, as I mentioned above. However, I do believe that at the moment all
the cases have a clear a main direction. But then, if these are generic
bindings, do we want to rely on that?

Ok. If we go for single directional link, the question is then: which
way? And is the direction different for display and camera, which are
kind of reflections of each other?

I don't see any harm in that, but I don't right away see what could be
done with them? Did you have something in mind?

I guess those could be used to study the graph before the drivers have
been loaded. After the drivers have been loaded, the drivers should
somehow register themselves and the ports/endpoints. And as the driver
knows what kind of ports they are, it can supply this information in the
runtime data structures.

If we do that, would it be better to have two pieces of data:
input/output/bi-directional, and the port type (say, mipi-dpi, lvds, etc.=
)?
