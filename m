I'd rather add a way to the control framework to set controls busy. The
busy state would likely need to be a count, since the driver itself also
must be able to set controls busy. It could also keep track of who did set
those controls busy to ease debugging.

The sensor driver also must set dependent controls busy.

Sounds good to me.
