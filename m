I think the newer cards aren't realy better than the old ones.


I have a skystar2.6b. This card is working very well but Technisat produced 
newer versions without realy new features.
The only thing is the linuxdrivers need to be adapted for those cards.

Technotrend FF dvb-2.1 and the s-2300 is another example.

Sorry I hope you can understand what I mean.
