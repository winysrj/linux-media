Hi Andrey and Olli,

sorry, didn't described that, it's written down in the patch (here: https://patchwork.linuxtv.org/patch/33811/).

I never have written drivers before so I think I shouldn't start with it now because I have to ask too many questions... So hopefully olli or someone else can rewrite the driver to support this device. If I can help with anything, just ask.

The dualHD is a great device to insert dvb signals in home environments because it's small and not very expensive. E.g. together with and RPI and SATPI you can put it in a wall-mounted media box if you have such one for your home network.

Hi Andrey,

When I submitted the original patch to add support for this device I stated that it only supports the first tuner. The em28xx driver is not built with dual-tuner support in mind and I had not enough interest to start changing it (the driver supports like 100 devices and is quite massive). There should not be many issues in using the second tuner itself on this device, it's just another I2C bus...

Cheers,
-olli
