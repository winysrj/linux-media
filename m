I agree that breaking user-to-kernel interface is not advised.
We came across a similar problem some years ago with the ALSA sound
kernel drivers.
The solution we used was:
1) If a change is likely to change the user-to-kernel API, add a new
IOCTL for it.
Then old userland software can use the old IOCTL, and new userland
software can use the new IOCTL.
2) Add an version IOCTL that returns the current API level, so that
the app can be written to support more than one API interface,
depending on which kernel it is running on. The version IOCTL simply
returns an u32 value. This is a consistent part of the user-kernel API
that will never change.
3) Add "depreciated" compiler warnings to all the old API IOCTL calls,
so app developers know they should be working to update their apps.
4) After a few years, remove the old IOCTLs.
5) Use "uint32_t" and "uint64_t" types for all IOCTL calls, and not
"unsigned int" or "unsigned long int".
I.e. All structures passed in IOCTLs use fixed bit sized parameters
for everything except of course pointers. Pointers depend on
architecture.
6) Add a #if #endif around the old API, so a user compiling their own
kernel can decide if the old API exists or not. User might want to do
this for security reasons.

Kind Regards

James
