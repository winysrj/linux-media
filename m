As far as I can see the module parameter is available in both cases but
defaults to different values when builtin and when loadable.

0) I've noticed similar dependencies (while doing some other Kconfig
related clean up) with a number of other config entries in that same
Kconfig file:
    $ git grep -n "depends on.*=y" drivers/media/radio/
    drivers/media/radio/Kconfig:60: depends on RADIO_RTRACK=y
    drivers/media/radio/Kconfig:83: depends on RADIO_RTRACK2=y
    drivers/media/radio/Kconfig:106:        depends on RADIO_AZTECH=y
    drivers/media/radio/Kconfig:135:        depends on RADIO_GEMTEK=y
    drivers/media/radio/Kconfig:147:        depends on RADIO_GEMTEK=y
    drivers/media/radio/Kconfig:239:        depends on RADIO_TERRATEC=y
    drivers/media/radio/Kconfig:257:        depends on RADIO_TRUST=y
    drivers/media/radio/Kconfig:280:        depends on RADIO_TYPHOON=y
    drivers/media/radio/Kconfig:287:        depends on RADIO_TYPHOON=y
    drivers/media/radio/Kconfig:314:        depends on RADIO_ZOLTRIX=y
    drivers/media/radio/Kconfig:385:        depends on RADIO_TEA5764=y 

1) It seems the logic behind those config symbols is mostly like this:
- if the driver for a radio is builtin: default some setting for that
  radio to a sane value, but allow overriding of that setting on the
  kernel commandline (through a module parameter)
- if the driver for a radio is a module: default that same setting to
  something invalid and _force_ the use of module parameters to get a
  sane value

This logic isn't implemented flawless but it does look to me that this
is intentional.

2) I'm not sure why things are done that way. Why can't builtin drivers
and loadable drivers default to identical values? But perhaps I'm just
misunderstanding the code.
