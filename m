Sure, having remote-endpoint as required doesn't achieve anything
particular as such. I just feel it's cleaner. If you have an endpoint,
it must point to somewhere. Maybe it makes the code a tiny bit simpler.

If we do already have users for this that do not have the
remote-endpoint, then we're stuck with having it as optional. If we
don't, I'd rather have it as mandatory.

In any case, it's not a very important thing either way.

That's true. I went with having the ports in the board file, for example
on omap3 the dss has two ports, and N900 board uses the second one:

&dss {
	status =3D "ok";

	pinctrl-names =3D "default";
	pinctrl-0 =3D <&dss_sdi_pins>;

	vdds_sdi-supply =3D <&vaux1>;

	ports {
		#address-cells =3D <1>;
		#size-cells =3D <0>;

		port@1 {
			reg =3D <1>;

			sdi_out: endpoint {
				remote-endpoint =3D <&lcd_in>;
				datapairs =3D <2>;
			};
		};
	};
};

Here I guess I could have:

&dss {
	status =3D "ok";

	pinctrl-names =3D "default";
	pinctrl-0 =3D <&dss_sdi_pins>;

	vdds_sdi-supply =3D <&vaux1>;
};

&dss_sdi_port {
	sdi_out: endpoint {
		remote-endpoint =3D <&lcd_in>;
		datapairs =3D <2>;
	};
};

But I didn't like that as it splits the pincontrol and regulator supply
from the port/endpoint, which are functionally linked together.

Actually, somewhat aside the subject, I'd like to have the pinctrl and
maybe regulator supply also per endpoint, but I didn't see how that
would be possible with the current framework. If a board would need to
endpoints for the same port, most likely it would also need to different
sets of pinctrls.
