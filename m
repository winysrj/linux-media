Yes these are generic.

Ok.

ST IRB block has one IR processor which has both TX and RX support and
one UHF Processor which has RX support only. However the register map
for all these support is in single IRB IP block.

So the driver can configure the IP as TX in "infrared" and RX in "uhf".
This is supported in ST IRB IP.

This case can not be represented in a single device tree node with
l1-protocol and direction properties.

IMHO, having tx-mode and rx-mode or tx-protocol and rx-protocol
properties will give more flexibility.

What do you think?
