Subject: DVB-API v5 questions and no dvb developer answering ?

The last week two guys were kindly asking here on the list where to find 
a written DVB-API v5 documentation,
but nobody of the dvb driver community was answering.

http://www.mail-archive.com/linux-media@vger.kernel.org/msg01350.html
http://www.mail-archive.com/linux-media@vger.kernel.org/msg01300.html

Does that mean that:
- dvb developers are currently not interested in application developers 
integrating new DVB-API v5? or..
- no dvb developer reading that list knows something about 
documentation? or..
- does it simply not exist, so who is working on that api documentation 
stuff?


The offical documentation found on linuxtv.org is outdated and already 5 
years old, and describes only api v3.
See http://www.linuxtv.org/downloads/linux-dvb-api-1.0.0.pdf

Please read also the announcements on linuxtv:

Some improvements were proposed by the LinuxTV developers, in order to 
improve the S2API, including:
...
* Update DVB API documentation to reflect the API changes;"
[/quote]

But also this statement is already now five months old,
so i guess documentation should be finished meanwhile or at least 
started and usable/redistributable..

Is it possible to get some information on that topic?
