just saw this patch on another machine and it reminded me also on your
patch to select different frontends on multiple multi frontends card at
insmod, which can be quite useful and was tested by me.

They must pass the checks "patchwork" does, this includes to run "make
checkpatch" on them previously and then you will see them very soon in

http://patchwork.kernel.org/project/linux-media/list

They seem not to be there, also not with filters "any" set, and you
should have seen an automated commit message, if they should have made
it into v4l-dvb.

Please resend and check short time later, if they are at patchwork
linux-media.

Some sort of reject message would of course be fine on such and make
life easier, but does not happen yet.

Cheers,
Hermann
