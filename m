There is nothing to do without a good doc for the chip.
For now, I have 8-10 cards with SAA7162 without any acceptable answer from 
NXP. Yes, there was (is?) the note on the site, that there is a driver for 
Linux. Yes, I've got cards hoping, that there is a chance, that 
driver could be developed (and I can participate in development) in 
few months. So, we are waiting approx. 1.5 years. It seems like a kind of 
crime, when somebody says that it is a good gold thing, You've spend Your 
money, but without any effect: thing is made of copper. Local
representatives are asking the same  question about the value of the 
market, but after such a question contact delays for months, and idea of 
NDA is there too.

Thanx!
