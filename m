Ok, makes sense. It should be better documented, IMO.

Still have an issue with KERNEL_VERSION: this macro doesn't exist
anymore on any Kernel header files. It is produced dynamically
at /Makefile:

	define filechk_version.h
		(echo \#define LINUX_VERSION_CODE $(shell                         \
		expr $(VERSION) \* 65536 + 0$(PATCHLEVEL) \* 256 + 0$(SUBLEVEL)); \
		echo '#define KERNEL_VERSION(a,b,c) (((a) << 16) + ((b) << 8) + (c))';)
	endef

Btw, this likely means that this is already broken:

include/uapi/linux/media.h:#define MEDIA_API_VERSION                    KERNEL_VERSION(0, 1, 0)

as userspace won't be able to evaluate it.

We could hardcode its value, as you proposed, but, IMHO, that sucks.

Thanks,
Mauro
