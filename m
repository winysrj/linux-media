For OMAP4 FD, it is not needed to include FD into MC framework since a
intermediate buffer is always required. If your HW doesn't belong to this
case, what is the output of your HW FD in the link? Also sounds FD results
may not be needed at all for use space application in the case.

For normal cases, I think we need, :-)

Could you provide some practical use cases about these?

If FD result is associated with a frame, how can user space get the frame seq
if no v4l2 buffer is involved? Without a frame sequence, it is a bit
difficult to
retrieve FD results from user space.

If the input image data is from other HW(SoC bus, resizer HW, ...), is the
v4l2_buffer needed for the FD HW driver or application?

The detection time on image or frame data may be changed a lot, are
you sure that your FD HW can handle the data flow correctly? I understand
you FD HW has to integrate at least two buffers for coping with the issue, so it
should introduce some extra HW cost.

We are discussing about it, :-)

As I mentioned above, how does user space get frame sequence number
for retrieving FD results if no v4l2_buffer is involved for FD driver
and application?
