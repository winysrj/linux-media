Yes, debugfs looks like a much better place for this.  You can do
whatever you want in debugfs as long as you follow the one rule for it:
	There are no rules for debugfs.

Yeah, but I don't like it :)

It's best if you really don't do this, but it does happen as it is the
best way to show the information.  If that's the case, fine.

Ah.

By "user" do you mean userspace, or another kernel driver file?  If it's
a kernel driver, you can assume that they will be sane.  if userspace,
assume it's insane and do some checking of the name before you use it.

Same goes for no good reason to use it :)
