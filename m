This will not solve our problems. We need CMA also to create at least one
device private area that for sure will be in low memory (video codec).

I will rewrite ARM dma-mapping & CMA integration patch basing on the latest 
ARM for-next patches and add proof-of-concept of the solution presented in my
previous mail (2-level page tables and unmapping pages from low-mem).
