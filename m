That's why I believe the DRM API is our best solution to address all those 
issues.

I'm not advocating merging the DRM, FB and V4L APIs for memory management. 
What I would like to investigate is whether we can use a common API for the 
common needs, which are (in my opinion):

- reporting the entities that make up the graphics pipeline (such as planes, 
overlays, compositors, transmitters,  connectors, ...), especially when 
pipelines get more complex than the plane->crtc->encoder->connector DRM model

- configuring data routing in those complex pipelines

- and possibly configuring formats (pixel format, frame size, crop rectangle, 
composition rectangle, ...) on those entities

I second Rob here, I think that API should be enough to solve our memory 
sharing problems between different devices. This is a bit out of scope though, 
as neither the low-level Linux display framework proposal nor my comments 
target that, but it's an important topic worth mentioning.
