IMHO it would be better if you provided some code example, but let's try to 
check if I understood you correctly.

8><------------------------------------------------------------------------

[Board file]

static struct phy my_phy;

static struct platform_device phy_pdev = {
	/* ... */
	.platform_data = &my_phy;
	/* ... */
};

static struct platform_device phy_pdev = {
	/* ... */
	.platform_data = &my_phy;
	/* ... */
};

[Provider driver]

struct phy *phy = pdev->dev.platform_data;

ret = phy_create(phy);

[Consumer driver]

struct phy *phy = pdev->dev.platform_data;

ret = phy_get(&pdev->dev, phy);

------------------------------------------------------------------------><8

Is this what you mean?

I fully agree that a simple, single string will not scale even in some, not 
so uncommon cases, but there is already a lot of existing lookup solutions 
over the kernel and so there is no point in introducing another one.

It's technically correct, but quality of this solution isn't really nice, 
because it's a layering violation (at least if I understood what you mean). 
This is because you need to have full definition of struct phy in board file 
and a structure that is used as private data in PHY core comes from 
platform code.
