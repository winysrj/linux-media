Hi,

I'm being blamed for some bugs for more than one year, and this
weekend I was able to reproduce the error for the first time. I have
the impression that the issue is related to Kconfig because when
compiling the Kernel for x86(not x86_64), and
when:
CONFIG_VIDEO_CX23885=y

and

CONFIG_MEDIA_TUNER_TDA18271=m

the build fails as the tuner code was compiled as a module when it
should have been compiled as part of the Kernel. On the Kconfig file
drivers/media/pci/cx23885/Kconfig:
config VIDEO_CX23885
        tristate "Conexant cx23885 (2388x successor) support"
        ...
        select MEDIA_TUNER_TDA18271 if MEDIA_SUBDRV_AUTOSELECT

which I think is the problem. Can I just remove this 'if
MEDIA_SUBDRV_AUTOSELECT'? Or what is the correct way of telling
Kconfig to set CONFIG_MEDIA_TUNER_TDA18271 based on the value of
CONFIG_VIDEO_CX23885?

There are at least 6 similar cases which I'm willing to send patches.

Thank you,

Peter
