No objections here, consider it acked.

Mauro: as far as I'm concerned, Daniel can be considered a co-maintainer
of the OLPC camera drivers.  I'm not planning to forget about them, and
I'll certainly still look at patches, but please don't ever hold up
something from him if (as has, on very rare occasion, been known to
happen) I get a little slow.

Thanks,

jon
