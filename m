Yes, signal strenght isn't the best to read, but let it run for a little 
bit. Your ber isn't great but you have unc's UNC = Unrecoverable Error. 
This can usually be seen on screen or heard. unc should be 0 for 
'perfect' image. So it looks like a bad signal reception to me, which 
could be the reason you are not receiving everything.

Nou, only Boequet 1 is Free to Air, that is NL1, NL2, NL3 and Omroep 
West in your case. The rest is all encrypted!

Answering this off list, as its too offtopic.
