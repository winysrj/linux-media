This patch set adds handling of the i2c_board_info struct to the saa7115 driver.
The main goal of this patch is to give the different devices with the gm7113c
chip an opportunity to configure the chip to their needs.

I've only implemented the overrides I know are necessary to get the stk1160
and the smi2021 drivers to work.

This is the forth version of this patch series.
There are only minor changes since version 3 of this patch series.
I've mostly just changed some comments, and removed some debug statements
in the last patch in the series.
