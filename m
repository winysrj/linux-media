If you take a look at libv4l, it hooks calls to open/close/ioctl/read/write glibc
calls. So, when an userspace application calls "open", it will run the library
code, and not glibc open function. So, it is completely transparent to the
userspace application.

Yes.

Yes, but if you do it on userspace, you don't need to do double buffering.
With a proxy, the same data will need to be passed 3 times from/to kernelspace:
2 times at vtunerc, and 1 time to the network driver. If implemented on userspace,
all it needed is to pass the data to the network driver, reducing latency.

Also, newer functions can be added on userspace in order to optimize applications
that will use it as a library, like providing functions that combine DVB and
network commands altogether.

If the intention is to limit it to just frontend ioctl's, you're right: the
only difference is that latency will be a little higher, probably unnoticed
(yet, introduced for not a good reason). But, if the intention is to also
provide remote streaming, then the volume of data copied tree times will
be noticeable, especially if the stream is in HD and/or if support for full-featured
DVB cards is added later.

That's partially true. If the library and the userspace client are bound together,
if new features are added at the library, the userspace client can assume that those
new features will be there. So, you only need to take care with backward compatibility
at the library side. With that functionality in Kernel, backward compatibility should 
be warranted on both ways.

Yes.

With LD_PRELOAD, it will be transparent.

True.
