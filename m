Thanks for the catch :-)

the property is derived from the datasheet itself for example the
'adi,power-mode-sleep-mode' --> Register 0x0 power mode bit 0
'adi,power-mode-pll-ctrl' ---> Register 0x0 power mode bit 1
'adi,dac-enable' ----> Register 0x0 power mode bit 2-7
'adi,sd-dac-enable' ---> Register 0x82 SD mode register bit 1-2
