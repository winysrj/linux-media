There is no particular field order in the data itself. But for BT.656
there is a specific field order, defined by the F flag in the SAV/EAV
codes. For PAL usually F=0 is the top field and F=1 is the bottom field.
For NTSC it usually is the other way around.

That's why I'd like to make it obvious to the user when the field order
is switched. Whoever selects seq-bt -> seq-tb or seq-tb -> seq-bt
transformation for progressive sources can expect combing artifacts.
