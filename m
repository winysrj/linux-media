I cannot work on this now. But I think that I can do an integration like the 
one that I pushed some month ago (a8f3c203e19b702fa5e8e83a9b6fb3c5a6d1cce4).
Wind River made that changes to videobuf-contig and I tested, fixed and 
pushed.

I don't have a full understand of the board so I don't know exactly why 
dma_alloc_coherent does not work. I focused my development on previous work by 
Wind River. I asked to Wind River (which did all the work on this board) for 
the technical explanation about why coherent doesn't work, but they do not 
know. That's why I made the new allocator: coherent doesn't work and HW 
doesn't support SG.

me too, I'm not a DMA performance expert. I'm just an user of the DMA API. On 
my hardware simply it works only with that interface, it is not a performance 
problem.

As I wrote above, I'm not a DMA performance expert. I skip this
