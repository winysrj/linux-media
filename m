As said before, I'm not sure. Yes, it makes it easier to select misc
device drivers from Kconfig files. But it also makes it impossible to
deselect all misc device drivers at once.

I think that what we really need is the implementation in the Kconfig
system of smart selects, i.e. whenever an entry is selected, everything
it depends on gets selected as well. I don't know how feasible this is,
but if it can be done then I'd prefer this to your proposal.

Meanwhile, I am not in favor of applying your patch. The benefit is
relatively small IMHO (misc device drivers are rarely selected) and
there is one significant drawback.

That being said, I'm not the one to decide, so if you can convince
someone with more power (aka Andrew Morton)...

If you patch gets applied, then this one would better be moved to
drivers/misc/lis3lv02d/Kconfig.
