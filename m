Yes. The issue was noticed with media drivers when people started using the
drivers on Fedora 17, witch came with udev-182. There's an open
bugzilla there:

Yes, that is the case for most media devices. Some devices can only be
detected as a supported device after the firmware load, as we need the
firmware for the USB (or PCI) bridge to be there, in order to talk with
the media components under the board's internal I2C bus, as sometimes
the same USB/PCI ID is used by boards with different internal components.
