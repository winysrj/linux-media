Hi !

Note sure where exactly to put it. Here is an lirc driver provided by
Nuovoton as it seems, which can be downloaded from the vendors site:

http://www.asrock.com/Nettop/download.asp?Model=ION%20330HT&o=Linux

It adds an lirc driver for the receiver as used in the Asrock 330HT and
newer models from Asrock. 

Can this go into lirc, or better, can something be done to integrate it
"somehow" ? 


Kind Regards

Steffen
