Hi Hans and Mauro,

We have do room in the schedule for the USB mini-summit for this
discussion, since the schedule is still pretty flexible.  The
preliminary schedule is up here:

http://userweb.kernel.org/~sarah/linuxcon-usb-minisummit.html

I think it's best to discuss the VM redirection in the afternoon when
some of the KVM folks join us after Hans' talk on USB redirection over
the network.

It sounds like we need a separate topic for the dual mode cameras and TV
tuners.  Mauro, do you want to lead that discussion in the early morning
(in a 9:30 to 10:30 slot) or in the late afternoon (in a 15:30 to 16:30
slot)?  I want to be sure we have all the video/media developers who are
interested in this topic present, and I don't know if they will be going
to the KVM forum.

Link PM was originally slated for the 10am slot, but since we're missing
several people for that discussion (Alan Stern, Andiry Xu, and any of
the Intel folks who did the Moorestown USB 2.0 LPM), I think it will be
more useful to have that discussion on-list or at another conference.
