I checked out latest
git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/sameo/mfd-next.git and
applied patches 5 - 10, 12. There doesn't seem to be any problems, so
I think MFD part of the driver is good to go.

Mauro, I am not sure if you need me to rebase any of the patches(it
doesn't seem like you had a chance to make any further changes related
to this driver in media tree), but if you do, ping me and I'll get on
it.
