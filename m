Actually my understand was that DT links would have the same direction =
as the=20
data flow. There would be no ambiguity in that case as the direction of=
 the=20
data flow is known. What happens for bidirectional data flows still nee=
d to be=20
discussed though. And if we want to use the of-graph bindings to descri=
be=20
graphs without a data flow, a decision will need to be taken there too.=
