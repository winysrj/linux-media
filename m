I'm not sure about this patch. Big files tend to be harder to maintain,
as it takes more time to find the right functions inside it. Also, IMO, 
it makes sense to keep the raw-event code on a separate file.

Anyway, if we apply this patch right now, it will cause merge conflicts with
the input tree, due to the get/setkeycodebig patches, and with some other
patches that are pending merge/review. The better is to apply such patch
just after the release of 2.6.37-rc1, after having all those conflicts
solved.

Cheers,
Mauro
