It is not easily to increase it because there is very limited space reserved for
this purpose, see Documentation/arm/memory.txt. Also looks like it is
not configurable.

Why not introduce it so that other drivers(include face detection) can
benefit with it? :-)

I don't see any casts are needed. The dma address can be got from vaddr with
dma_map_* easily in drivers, see the usage on patch 8/8(media: video: introduce
omap4 face detection module driver).

These two helpers are not needed and won't be provided by VIDEOBUF2_PAGE memops.
