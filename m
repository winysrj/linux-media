That's the subsystem point of view, not the driver point of view.  As
far as the driver is concerned the device appears when probe() is called
and vanishes after remove() has completed, any management the subsystem
does in between is up to it.

I agree with this.  There are also some use cases where the device data
is actually static (eg, a generic description of the device or a
reference to some other shared resource rather than per device allocated
data).

This is where the mismatch between the subsystem view of the device
lifetime and the driver view of the device lifetime comes into play.
For the driver once the device is unregistered the device no longer
exists - if the driver tries to work with the device it's buggy.  This
means that to the driver returning from the remove() function is
dropping the reference to the data and there's no reason for the driver
to take any other action.

The device may hang around after the remove() has happened, but if the
device driver knows or cares about it then it's doing something wrong.
Similarly on probe() we can't assme anything about the pointer since
even if we saw the device before we can't guarantee that some other
driver didn't do so as well.  The situation is similar to that with
kfree() - we don't memset() data we're freeing with that, even though it
might contain pointers to other things.

Personally I'd much rather just not bother setting the driver data in
the removal path, it seems unneeded.  I had assumed that the subsystem
code cared for some reason when I saw the patch series.
