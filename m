We don't. Letting userspace shoot into it's foot is part of the interface.
drm drivers and afaik also v4l has some explicit interfaces where
userspace and the kernel can communicate who is allowed to stomp on a
buffer (and sync up access with various degrees of sophistication).
Userspace still needs to use this interfaces to ensure that any dma
activity it wants to have completed is completed.

To ensure coherency for userspace that does not try to get unnecessary
holes in its feet, the exporter needs to zap all ptes pointing to a dma
buf object and flush relevant parts of the cpu cache before device dma
starts (signalled with dma_buf_map_sg from the importer atm, but we'll
eventually grow streaming support I guess). On page fault time it has then
to invalidate any cpu caches, so that userspace does not read stale data.

Like I've said in the above blurb in the documentation, I think
synchronization is an orthogonal issue to sharing memory.
