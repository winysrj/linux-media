Hi all,
I found this link on a forum: 
http://www.anysee.com/eng/product/anyseeE30PS2Plus.php
which, after more information seems to be a stv0903 based card with CI 
which is tested (from the info given by the forum guy) at 45MS/s  for 
DVB-S2 (the saint-Graal for me to get my HD pay channels here ;-)
So my question: does anybody here know about this card and if there is a 
driver somewhere?
TIA,
Bye
Manu
