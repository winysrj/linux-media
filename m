struct go7007 contains "struct v4l2_device v4l2_dev;" field, so if transfer it uninitialized (may be nonzero)
in function: "int v4l2_device_register_subdev(struct v4l2_device *v4l2_dev, struct v4l2_subdev *sd)"
(drivers/media/video/v4l2-device.c), so next code may be called:
#if defined(CONFIG_MEDIA_CONTROLLER)
	/* Register the entity. */
	if (v4l2_dev->mdev) {
		err = media_device_register_entity(v4l2_dev->mdev, entity);
		if (err < 0) {
			if (sd->internal_ops && sd->internal_ops->unregistered)
				sd->internal_ops->unregistered(sd);
			module_put(sd->owner);
			return err;
		}
	}
#endif
I`ve got error here. because go7007 don`t control mdev field.

The next kzalloc: "gofh = kzalloc(sizeof(struct go7007_file), GFP_KERNEL);" was written only for zero initialization on creation purpose, driver work properly without it changing

It`s very horrible to describe every changing...
