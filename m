As far as I understand, V4L2 wouldn't be the only kernel API to use ENOTTY
to tell that an ioctl doesn't exist; there are others. And many switched
from EINVAL they used in the past. From that point it would be good to do it
on V4L2 as well. Although I have to reckon that the V4L2 API does serve use
cases of quite different natures than these --- I can't think of an
equivalent e.g. to that astronomy application using V4L1 in the scope of
these:

Examples:
- Networking
- KVM
- SCSI/libata-scsi

Currently EINVAL is used to signal from a phletora of conditions in V4L2,
usually bad, in a way or another, parameters to an ioctl. The more low level
APIs we add (for cameras, for example), the less guessing of parameters can
be done in general. I think it would be important to distinguish the two
cases and we don't have enumeration capability (do we?) to tell which IOCTLs
the application should be expect to be able to use.

Interestingly enough, V4L2 core (v4l2_ioctl() in v4l2-dev.c) does return
ENOTTY *right now* when the IOCTL handler is not defined. Have we heard
about this up to now? :-)

As you mention, switching to ENOTTY in general would change the ABI which
would potentially break applications. Can this be handled in a way or
another? My understanding is that not many applications would rely on EINVAL
telling an IOCTL isn't implemented. GStreamer v4l2src might be one in its
attempt to figure out what kind of image sizes the device supports. Fixing
this would be a very small change.

In short, I think it would be beneficial to switch to ENOTTY in the long
run even if it causes some momentary pain.

Kind regards,
