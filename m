Hi,

i own a Freecom rev 4 DVB-T USB-stick using a rtl2831u chip inside. Since a=
bout February this year, drivers for that stick are available and a lot of =
discussion about the driver was done on this list. =


But it seems for quite some time that no further discussion happens anymore=
.. I am using debian SID (sidux) and the actual kernel there (2.6.26-5.slh.=
4-sidux-686) from some days ago still does not include the rtl2831u dvb-t d=
river. So, I wonder now what the next steps are to make this driver availab=
le in the linux kernel, and when it will probably happen.

Background of my question is that I would like to use the stick of course, =
but without patching and compiling a new kernel from source by myself.

So, what is the future plan of rtl2831u for kernel integration? I am not fa=
miliar with the standard procedure of the diffusion process into mainstream=
 kernel versions, so I would appreciate any comments on this topic.

Best regards,
Peter Mayer
