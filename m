That beeing said. What is currently the cheapest availible, and
supported, DVB-C USB/PCI unit availible?
We have the Hauppauge 930c for 650 NOK here now (about €75), and I
have seen the Satelco cards on dvbshop for €55. But the shipping to
Norway from dvbshop (which I believe is in germany) is more than what
makes it valuable.
