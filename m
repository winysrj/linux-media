IMO, that makes the interface clearer. Also, the encoding code is needed
anyway, as it is needed to setup the wake up keycode on some hardware.
So, we already added encoder capabilities at some decoders:

0d830b2d1295 [media] rc: rc-core: Add support for encode_wakeup drivers
cf257e288ad3 [media] rc: ir-rc6-decoder: Add encode capability
a0466f15b465 [media] rc: ir-rc5-decoder: Add encode capability
1d971d927efa [media] rc: rc-ir-raw: Add Manchester encoder (phase encoder) helper
9869da5bacc5 [media] rc: rc-ir-raw: Add scancode encoder callback

We actually need to be sure that the NEC encoder is doing the same
way as the RC5/RC6 encoders.
