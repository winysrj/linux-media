Hello all,

I would really much like to know if somebody is working yet on adding
support to the kernel for the Elgato Eyetv Hybrid DVB/Analogue USB TV
tuner stick (Vendor 0fd9 Product 0018).

lsusb currently only shows there is a device with ID 0df9:0018

>From what i found on the internet, the device's specs are:
Model: EU 2008
USB Controller: Empia EM2884
Stereo A/V Decoder: Micronas AVF 49x08
Hybrid Channel Decoder: Micronas DRX-K DRX3926K:A1 0.9.0

I spoke to a few people on the IRC linuxtv channel @freenode and someone
told this was the best place to ask for it.


Regards,

Eddie.
