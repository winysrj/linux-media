Subject: [PATCH 02/11] cec rst: convert tables and drop the 'row' comments
Date: Wed,  2 Nov 2016 13:46:26 +0100
Message-Id: <20161102124635.11989-3-hverkuil@xs4all.nl>

From: Hans Verkuil <hans.verkuil@cisco.com>

This uses Laurent's python script to convert all tables, dropping
the useless 'row' comments.

See commit c2b66cafdf02 ("[media] v4l: doc: Remove row numbers from tables")
for the script that was used.
