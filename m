Not sure if it's realistic, but I think it would be nice to have
a way for converting the current slave drivers that use the
mask/filter/param API to the dev/name based API. We should
be able to do this by registering a lookup table from platform
code that translates one to the other, like we do with the
clkdev lookup to find a device clock based on a local identifier.

The main downside of this is that it's a lot of work if we want
to completely remove dma_request_channel() for slave drivers,
but it could be done more gradually.

Another upside is that we could come up with a mechanism to
avoid the link-time dependency on the filter-function that
causes problems when that filter is defined in a loadable
module for the dmaengine driver.
