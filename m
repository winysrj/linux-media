Hans,

This was clearly a case of me missing the true understanding of your
comments. I just reviewed your email and sure enough you stated in
there what I should have looked for. I apologize for not being as
thorough as you needed. I have removed all traces of the old module
and ran through my test script and there are no further messages!
Thank you for doing this, I'll update my post in the SageTV boards to
make sure this step is not overlooked there as well.

Once again, thank you for all of your efforts! Everything that you,
Andy, and Janne have done this year has helped make all my devices
work well in my machine. (3 CX18s and 1 HDPVR) I truly appreciate it.

Brandon
