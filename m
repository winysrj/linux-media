yes, Brandon is right, just ask.

However, you can't expect answers always soon, if you just want help to
get some things done ..., but if you get them, they are for free.

This is Alan's list and I don't claim to speak for him.

The list is open for all trying to contribute, as they can.

It is also not a decision, which can be made from the v4l wiki people,
how this goes further, not that the direction into CityK tries to move
is wrong.

But to be honest, I still sometimes think, we would have had much less
trouble without being on linuxtv.org in the first place, just when
recovering.

Cheers,
Hermann
