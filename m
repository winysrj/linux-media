Fortunately this has been a menu control, since it was introduced. Only 
the DocBook erroneously defined it as an enum. This patch also fixes that, 
please see the DocBook part.

In my use case, the hardware has 3 registers: one of them selects the colour
effect and two others determine Cr, Cb coefficients (probably I could use
V4L2_CID_RED_BALANCE, V4L2_CID_BLUE_BALANCE for that, but so far these are 
just private controls). 

If I would have removed the V4L2_COLORFX_ARBITRARY item, another control
would have to be added (let's say boolean V4L2_PRIV_IMG_EFFECT). Just to 
enable the "arbitrary" effect. 

Then, to enable the arbitrary effect V4L2_CID_COLORFX would have to be set
to V4L2_COLORFX_NONE, nnd V4L2_PRIV_IMG_EFFECT to true.

The CB, CR coefficients are meaningful only when the arbitrary effect is
selected. So having another option in the menu, which drivers can just mask
if they don't support it, appeared better to me. 

It's a bit similar to gain/autogain scenario, where gain is active only when
autogain is off.
Maybe I should just add another private control (V4L2_PRIV_IMG_EFFECT) and
remove V4L2_COLORFX_ARBITRARY item.
