Not exactly. People usually say it is a rebrand/clone of KNC1+, but it's
not. :) There are couple of differences -- Mystique is a lighter version
missing these features:
1) Signal passthrough via loop-out connector
2) Video input port for analogue capture

I'm glad you reminded me of this misconception, the differences might be
important for somebody. I was considering Mystique for myself, but chose
CX24116 over STB0899, because this time, I wanted official support. I
don't need analogue capture and CI anyway (I use softcam and for analog,
much better Hauppauge PVR-500). I suggest Mystique instead of KNC1+ for
purely practical reasons - it's more available, cheaper and nicer. :)
