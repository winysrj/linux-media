Ok, I've spent some time digging deeper into the code, checking em28xx,
the subdev drivers (msp3400, saa7115_auto, tvp5150, tvaudio, tuner,
mt9v011, ov2640) an and all the places where we're applying GPIO-sequences.

The em28xx driver is already at least partially aware of the problem,
that GPIO-sequences might change the power states of the subdevices or
reset them.
That's why em28xx_wake_i2c() is called in several places after GPIO
sequences have been applied (see code comments).
As the name already implies, these are places where we want to make sure
that the subdevices are in power-on state.
So adding a (s_power, 1) call at the beginning of this function would be
a good starting point. AFAICS, this can't break things.
This would also make sure that (s_power, 1) is called before the first
(s_power, 0) call and silence the warning about unbalanced
v4l2_clk_disable() calls.

However, I doubt we'll ever get the s_power calls really balanced.
Due to the GPIO-problems, there will likely always be more power-on
calls than power-off calls and hence more v4l2_clk_enable() than
v4l2_clk_disable() calls.

Frank
