Hi,

I read and sometimes post to this mailing list, but I very much prefer to use a newsreader from 
gmane rather than receiving all the mails.

In the old linux-dvb mailing list it was possible to switch off receiving all the emails,
is it still possible?

I could not find anything in the documentation of majordomo@vger.kernel.org

Any help?
