I agree with you that we should not apply a patch till we come to a
conclusion about the design.

But the patches which I have sent (PATCH-SET 7) that doesn't deal with
FM band selection, instead it adds
few other features like below
        1) FM RX RDS AF turn ON/OFF
        2) FM RX De-Emphasis mode set/get
        3) FM TX Alternate Frequency set/get

So since these are other features which are not related to Band
selection I think you can merge these to K3.6 kernel.
