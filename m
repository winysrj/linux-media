Which is correct prefix?

Earlier I used PATCH RFC, but then I saw that ATTN:
[ANN] Report on the San Jose V4L/DVB mini-summit
http://www.spinics.net/lists/linux-media/msg76281.html

- Add 'ATTN' inside pull request subject line tp indicate that Mauro's 
(or some other maintainer's) attention is required. Should be limited to 
api changes, dependencies.

OK, it speaks only pull request, but that was patchset having API changes...

regards
Antti
