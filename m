It does not, there's no code that would do that. I actually fixed that only
to find out that the scaling is unusable at least with the MicroCam because
of black horizontal lines that appear in the image (amount of the lines
depend on the scaling factor). So I just disabled the scaling completely for
MicroCam.

I also don't know if the multiple-of-64 width limit is valid for all
usbvision devices - that's why I haven't posted patch to fix this.
