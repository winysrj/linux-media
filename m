Keep in mind that I tried to reach you several times via mail and irc
and you simply
ignored me. Did you know that took almost all of your patches (with
small changes)?
And I needed to cherry pick you patches as they were a) wrong, b) solved in a
different way or c) had "hack" in the subject. I am quite sorry that I
ended that
way, but it is not only my fault!

That is bad, but life moves on.
