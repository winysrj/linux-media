Well, sign me up!  I would love to help the efforts to expand device
support, but at this point I'm personally blocked by the fact that I
have already bought four tuners in the last year, combined with the
lack of actual documentation which results in it taking *way* longer
than it has to.

Sure, I got all four of them to work which is progress, but it would
have gone much faster if the docs were available to me and I wasn't
laying out my own cash to buy tuners I have no personal use for.

I've spent all this time to learn the codebase and I'd like to
leverage that knowledge more, but now I have to ask myself, "What am I
going to do with four tuners?"

Devin
