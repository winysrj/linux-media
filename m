You can't do that, because format and selection rectangles on a pad can depend 
on the formats and selection rectangles on other pads of the same subdev. For 
instance setting the format on the source pad of a scaler will ignore the 
media bus code and return the code configured on the sink pad. A full 
configuration must thus be passed to the pad operations.

Exactly :-)

That's done all over the place, look at the OMAP3 ISP subdev for instance.
