Do you have a use case where you would need to strobe a flash from multiple
media devices at different times, or is this entirely theoretical? Typically
flash controllers are connected to a single source of hardware strobe (if
there's one) since the flash LEDs are in fact mounted next to a specific
camera sensor.

If this is a real issue the way to solve it would be to have a single media
device instead of many.

I wouldn't be concerned of this in particular. It's more important we do
actully have V4L2 flash API supported by LED flash drivers and that they do
implement the API correctly.

It's at least debatable whether you should try to prevent user space from
doing silly things or not. With complex devices it may relatively easily
lead to wrecking havoc with actual use cases which we certainly do not want.

In this case, if you just prevent changing the routing (do you have a use
case for it?) while strobing, someone else could still change the routing
just before you strobe.
