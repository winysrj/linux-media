Thanks Lars - we definitely would need the v4l guys to agree to a driver like
this going in IIO. (not that I'm convinced it should!)

Whilst those are there, I would doubt the irrelevant bits would put much
burden on a fingerprint scanning driver.  Been a while since I did
anything in that area though so I could be wrong!

This is more interesting, but does that map well to IIO style
channels anyway?  If not we are going to end up with a whole new
interface which ever subsystem is used for the image side of things.

Sure - what you proposed would work.  The question is whether it is
the best way to do it.
