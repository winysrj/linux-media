I'm considering WinTV-HVR-1950.  Any comments?

Samsung claims:
"The new S5H1411 boasts a higher reception success rate than other devices 
in multi-path environments where signal interference is high, such as 
densely populated urban areas; dynamic environments with serious signal 
distortion among many moving vehicles; environments with major signal phase 
errors because of cable retransmission and remote areas where reception is 
generally poor."

Well, at least they have their heart in the right place :)  I have never 
been able to find real lab test results for ATSC reception performance.
