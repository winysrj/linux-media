Subject: Re: [PATCH] FE_GET_PROPERTY should be _IOW, because the associated
 structure is transferred from userspace to kernelspace. Keep the old ioctl

It only works, because _IOC_READ triggers a copy_from_user, as a
workaround for wrongly marked ioctls like this, according to a code
comment. It does not really do the right thing, because in this special
case the later call to copy_to_user isn't required. But it doesn't do
any real harm either.

Either way is fine for me.
