Dear Guennadi

Thank you for checking patch

I don't know detail of these register's order.
Because my datasheet doesn't have detail explain.

For example, does "strength" actually enforce
all of configured parameters change ?

So, I tried to test whether these register setting
order were important.

It seems to be independent apparently respectively.
For example, I can change only "upper" register and
the setting was effective.

So, I will ask to maker about these register's behavior.
Because it seems to relate to other register.
So, please ignore this patch until I get answer. sorry.

I will fix this in next =)
