Hello.

I have the Terratec Cinergy Hybrid T XS USB (em2882) - usb-id 0ccd:005e. 
It works with Marcus Rechberger's em28xx-new driver, but since that code 
is unmaintained now, I tested this device with v4l-dvb today.

The analog picture is there, but audio is very, very quiet, almost not 
there. Is there some way to increase the volume?

Second question, what would be required to get DVB working?

The final thing is not a question, it's actually something that works: 
the remote. It's the same one as comes with the other Hybrid XS 
(0ccd:0042), adding these two lines to the definition of this card in 
em28xx-cards.c makes it work:

		.ir_codes       = &ir_codes_terratec_cinergy_xs_table,
		.xclk           = EM28XX_XCLK_FREQUENCY_12MHZ,


Any pointers to solving my issues (analog audio, dvb) appreciated. I can 
test patches, I can give ssh access to my machine if it helps. There's 
even a Windows install on this machine, so USB sniffing of the Windows 
driver is possible, I just need instructions on what exactly to do.
Dmesg output for this device is attached.


Regards,
Uro≈°
