Not looking on the amount of work to be done, I think that this would
give better results, IMO.

Adam Baker's proposal of a locking between usbfs and the kernel driver seems
to be interesting, but, as he pointed, there are some side effects to consider,
like suspend/resume, PM, etc.

I don't think this is a good alternative.

I also don't think that this a good alternative. As Hans V. pointed, one of
our long term targets is to create per-sensor I2C drivers that are independent
from the bridges. Also, moving it to userspace would require lots of work
with the duplication of V4L and gspca core into userspace for the devices
that would be moved, and may have some performance impacts.

It will be great to have you there for those discussions.
