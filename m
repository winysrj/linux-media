OK, I looked at it a bit more and it needs to be changed a little bit. The
problem is that the VOLUME control is added after snd_tea575x_init, i.e.
after the video_register_device call. The video_register_device call should
be the last thing done before the init sequence returns. There may be applications
(dbus/hal) that open devices as soon as they appear, so doing more initialization
after the video node is registered is not a good idea (many older V4L drivers
make this mistake).

Perhaps creating a snd_tea575x_register function doing just the registration
may be a good idea. Or a callback before doing the video_register_device.

Another thing: the tea->mute field shouldn't be needed anymore. And the
'mute on init' bit in snd_tea575x_init can be removed as well since that
is automatically performed by v4l2_ctrl_handler_setup.

In addition, the .ioctl field in tea575x_fops can be replaced by .unlocked_ioctl.
The whole exclusive open stuff and the in_use field can be removed. The only
thing needed is a struct mutex in struct snd_tea575x, initialize it and set
tea575x_radio_inst->lock to the mutex. This will serialize all access safely.

To do this really right you should add struct v4l2_device to struct snd_tea575x
(the radio-sf16fmr2 driver has one, so you can use that as an example). With
that in place you can also add support for 'priority' handling. I'd say see
what you can do, and if it takes too much time then mail me the tea575x code
and the radio-sf16frm2 code and I'll finish it.

Regards,

	Hans
