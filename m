Hi maarten,

I'm applying dma-fence v11 and seqno-fence v4 to exynos drm and have
some proposals.

The above seqno_fence structure has only one dmabuf. Shouldn't it have
mutiple dmabufs? For example, in case of drm driver, when pageflip is
requested, one framebuffer could have one more gem buffer for NV12M
format. And this means that one more exported dmabufs should be
sychronized with other devices. Below is simple structure for it,

struct seqno_fence_dmabuf {
        struct list_head        list;
        int                            id;
        struct dmabuf          *sync_buf;
        uint32_t                   seqno_ops;
        uint32_t                   seqno;
};

The member, id, could be used to identify which device sync_buf is
going to be accessed by. In case of drm driver, one framebuffer could
be accessed by one more devices, one is Display controller and another
is HDMI controller. So id would have crtc number.

And seqno_fence structure could be defined like below,

struct seqno_fence {
        struct list_head                sync_buf_list;
        struct fence                      base;
        const struct fence_ops     *ops;
};

In addition, I have implemented fence-helper framework for sw sync as
WIP and below is intefaces for it,

struct fence_helper {
        struct list_head                    entries;
        struct reservation_ticket       ticket;
        struct seqno_fence              *sf;
        spinlock_t                             lock;
        void                                      *priv;
};

int fence_helper_init(struct fence_helper *fh, void *priv, void
(*remease)(struct fence *fence));
- This function is called at driver open so process unique context
would have a new seqno_fence instance. This function does just
seqno_fence_init call, initialize entries list and set device specific
fence release callback.

bool fence_helper_check_sync_buf(struct fence_helper *fh, struct
dma_buf *sync_buf, int id);
- This function is called before dma is started and checks if same
sync_bufs had already be committed to reservation_object,
bo->fence_shared[n]. And id could be used to identy which device
sync_buf is going to be accessed by.

int fence_helper_add_sync_buf(struct fence_helper *fh, struct dma_buf
*sync_buf, int id);
- This function is called if fence_helper_check_sync_buf() is true and
adds it seqno_fence's sync_buf_list wrapping sync_buf as
seqno_fence_dma_buf structure. With this function call, one
seqno_fence instance would have more sync_bufs. At this time, the
reference count to this sync_buf is taken.

void fence_helper_del_sync_buf(struct fence_helper *fh, int id);
- This function is called if some operation is failed after
fence_helper_add_sync_buf call to release relevant resources.

int fence_helper_init_reservation_entry(struct fence_helper *fh,
struct dma_buf *dmabuf, bool shared, int id);
- This function is called after fence_helper_add_sync_buf call and
calls reservation_entry_init function to set a reservation object of
sync_buf to a new reservation_entry object. And then the new
reservation_entry is added to fh->entries to track all sync_bufs this
device is going to access.

void fence_helper_fini_reservation_entry(struct fence_helper *fh, int id);
- This function is called if some operation is failed after
fence_helper_init_reservation_entry call to releae relevant resources.

int fence_helper_ticket_reserve(struct fence_helper *fh, int id);
- This function is called after fence_helper_init_reservation_entry
call and calls ticket_reserve function to reserve a ticket(locked for
each reservation entry in fh->entires)

void fence_helper_ticket_commit(struct fence_helper *fh, int id);
- This function is called after fence_helper_ticket_reserve() is
called to commit this device's fence to all reservation_objects of
each sync_buf. After that, once other devices try to access these
buffers, they would be blocked and unlock each reservation entry in
fh->entires.

int fence_helper_wait(struct fence_helper *fh, struct dma_buf *dmabuf,
bool intr);
- This function is called before fence_helper_add_sync_buf() is called
to wait for a signal from other devices.

int fence_helper_signal(struct fence_helper *fh, int id);
- This function is called by device's interrupt handler or somewhere
when dma access to this buffer has been completed and calls
fence_signal() with each fence registed to each reservation object in
fh->entries to notify dma access completion to other deivces. At this
time, other devices blocked would be waked up and forward their next
step.

For more detail, in addition, this function does the following,
- delete each reservation entry in fh->entries.
- release each seqno_fence_dmabuf object in seqno_fence's
sync_buf_list and call dma_buf_put() to put the reference count to
dmabuf.


Now the fence-helper framework is just WIP yet so there may be my
missing points. If you are ok, I'd like to post it as RFC.

Thanks,
Inki Dae
