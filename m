Hello,

I've reproduced this issue on a Logitech C920 in the following environments:

1. x86_64 Linux 3.19.3 (Gentoo, custom kernel)
2. x86_64 Linux 3.13.0-46-generic (Ubuntu)
3. armv7a Linux 3.19.3 (Arch Linux, custom kernel)

I can confirm that the issue is not present in Linux 3.8.y.

I'm not sure if there have been any developments in regards to this in 
recent months, but I'm happy to help out in any way possible. If someone 
is in need of new debug logs, I can follow the steps above and provide them.
