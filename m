I think not: MFD is a bit different from other subsystems in that it does
not have a user space interface by itself. It's also different from bus
drivers in that it is not specific to some particular class of hardware,
since it only abstracts devices that do multiple things independent of
how they do them.

It is similar to MISC_DEVICES (drivers/misc) in some regards, and I
would also like to turn that one back from menuconfig into menu for
the same reasons.

I agree that it's convenient for a lot of subsystems to be able to
turn them off entirely, but in case of MFD and MISC, I cannot see a clear
use case for that.

Ok. I had actually meant to send this mail out before the patches, but
apparently it got stuck in my mail client.
