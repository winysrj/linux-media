Hello Phil,

As unsupported products go, this one is worse than most - pretty much
none of the components are supported, nor is there documentation
available from the chipset vendor.

If this had been a product that was just a variant of some other
supported design using chips that we had drivers existing for then
this wouldn't be too hard, but that's not the case here.

Sorry, but if you're not a kernel developer then I would recommend you
buy a tuner that is already supported.

Devin
