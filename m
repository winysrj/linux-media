Hi again,

I looked at the driver again, and thanks to Hans, I found you could
easily lower the JPEG compression quality and stop buffer overflow.

At line 2093 of build/sn9c20x.c (gspca test), there is:

	sd->quality = 95;

Changing '95' to '80' should be enough.

I will add this parameter as a video control as soon as it will be
standard. Then you could adjust it with an external program as v4l2ucp.
