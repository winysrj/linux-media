While I was trying to locate astra on last year by rotating the dish I 
used both the cheap (10 euro) beeper that was but in the satellite cable 
end to find out the abbroximately dish direction. Fine tuning was done by 
starring the laptop screen szap output to find out when it started to 
printout LOCKED output. (I used ssh from the laptop to dvb card computer 
where I had put the channel info for one astra channel and tried to szap 
for that one. That of course meant that I needed the correct channel info 
for one channel in satellite even before I could try to scan channels from 
that satellite...)
