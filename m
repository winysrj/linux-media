Yes, that I think we all know. But some problem is that the arguments
against it are very weak. Believe me I would prefer to work on all
hints which kernel hackers gave me after code reviewing and not
to be member of flamewar.

Some features are designed for LAN use. I think nobody wants to use
SMBFS over Internet. But in LAN it works perfectly stable.

I guess you mean by "developing like userspave app" variant
of development kernel driver out of tree.

As you stated already - maintaining kernel-space code out of kernel
tree is much difficult. If anybody did any change in internal API, then
you have to catch it yourself, find the way to change your code
accordingly. If it would be in kernel, then such job is required to be
done by patch contributor.

To repeat my conclusion - I'm doing so already and seems I will
do it futher. No problem. At least as for now.
