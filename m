Yeah, that's essentially the point I was trying to make. Not to mention
all the other unrelated hardware that can't DMA to an address that might
disappear mid-transfer.

I am aware of ODP but, noted by others, it doesn't provide a general
solution to the points above.

Yes, this was the appeal to us of using ZONE_DEVICE.

It's also worth noting that #4 makes use of ZONE_DEVICE (#2) so they are
really the same option. iopmem is really just one way to get BAR
addresses to user-space while inside the kernel it's ZONE_DEVICE.
