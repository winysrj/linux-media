Reverting the version increment is a bad thing. I agree with Dmitry that
an application that fails just because the API version were incremented
is buggy.

Reverting it will also break the ir-keytable userspace program that it is
meant to be used by the Remote Controller devices, and uses it to adjust
its behaviour to support RC's with more than 16 bits of scancodes.

I agree that it is bad that the ABI broke, but reverting it will cause even
more damage.

The Remote Controller keycode tables are very sparse. In general,
they contain up to 100 entries, and the scan codes typically have 16
bits. Some newer devices have 24 or 32 bits. With version 1, as the table
index is the scancode, in order to read all keytables with EVIOCGKEYCODE,
the userspace needs to do 2^16 reads (or 2^32 for RC-6 remotes).
I don't need to say that this is highly ineffective. So, using V1
doesn't work fine anyway for Remote Controllers.

Btw, ir-keycodestool don't work with V1 and more than 16 bits, because it
doesn't scale. I didn't actually checked, but based on Dmitry's patch
for input-kbd, it is clear to me that the old version only supports 16
bits scancodes:

See, it will only look into the 16-bits scancode space. There are several remote
controllers with 24 bits and 32 bits, so the tool is already broken anyway.

On the tests I did here with an ir-keytable version made before such change,
with a Fedora rawhide kernel (2.6.37), I didn't notice any breakage at
EVIOCGKEYCODE. I'll do more tests tomorrow with a vanilla Kernel. I'll
compile a vanilla 2.6.37 kernel tomorrow and, if needed, write a patch.

Not arguing in favor of the version numbering, but it is easy to read
the version increment at the beginning of the application, and adjust
if the code will use EVIOCGKEYCODE or EVIOCGKEYCODE_V2 of the ioctl's,
depending on what kernel provides.

Ok, we might be just calling the new ioctl and check for -ENOSYS at
the beginning, using some fake arguments.
