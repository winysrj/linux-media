I've stopped looking for an alternative card, going to have a crack at 
getting my 7162-based device working.
Still, any suggestions in the meantime are most welcome! I've also 
decided AV-in isn't that important...
So just a known, nicely working PCI/e + dual DVB-T card, having the 
other features is nice but they needn't be working yet.

Wish me luck!   :-D
