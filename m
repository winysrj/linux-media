Hi

Well, I must confess, I'm surprised:-) It looks like you're right. This 
leak, if indeed there is one, has been there since the very first version 
of soc-camera. I've spent some time looking at the code and so far I don't 
find an explanation for the missing videobuf_mmap_free() call. I'll have 
another look and, unless I find an explanation, why it's not needed, I'll 
make a patch.

Also keep in mind, that this bug is only relevant for videobuf(1) drivers, 
which anyway have to be converted to videobuf2;-)

Thanks
Guennadi

Also can't call videobuf_mmap_free()->kfree(q->bufs[i]) at last close(), because in linux-2.6.x once open() allocates a videobuf_queue.

>               If is there no bug in soc camera module , i'm sure all device driver use soc camera module have bugs, such as sh_mobile_ceu_caera.c, mx1_caera.c, mx3_caera.c etc. all of them donn't call videobuf_mmap_free()->kfree(q->bufs[i]).
