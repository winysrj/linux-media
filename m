Hi Guys,

Sorry to go on about the Hauppauge ImpactVCB-e 01385, but it's a couple 
of years and version 12.04, since I last asked.

This page:

http://linuxtv.org/wiki/index.php/Hauppauge

Now shows:

Table of analog-only devices sold by Hauppauge Model Standard Interface 
Supported Comments
ImpactVCB-e Video PCIe âœ” Yes No tuners, only video-in. S-Video Capture 
works with kernel 3.5.0 (Ubuntu 12.10).

As my distribution is 13.10 with kernel 3.11, I believe it should work.

uname -a gives:

3.11.0-19-generic #33-Ubuntu SMP Tue Mar 11 18:48:34 UTC 2014 x86_64 
x86_64 x86_64 GNU/Linux

When I plug in my 01385 I get the same old stuff in dmseg, ie:

cx23885 driver version 0.0.3 loaded
[ 8.921390] cx23885[0]: Your board isn't known (yet) to the driver.
[ 8.921390] cx23885[0]: Try to pick one of the existing card configs via
[ 8.921390] cx23885[0]: card=<n> insmod option. Updating to the latest
[ 8.921390] cx23885[0]: version might help as well.
[ 8.921393] cx23885[0]: Here is a list of valid choices for the card=<n> 
insmod option:

Etc.

Does anyone have any idea of the issue here?

Best regards

Steve
