We discussed the problem in the below link previously[1], Steven
and Thomas suggested to use threaded irq handler, but which
may degrade USB mass storage performance, so we have to
take tasklet now until we rewrite transport part of USB mass storage
driver.

Also the conversion[2] has avoided the tasklet spin lock problem
already.
