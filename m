I agree that for the nuvoton my choice of wording (scancode) was a
poor one. Perhaps wakeup_code would suit both drivers?

The code to be shared is the logic of creating, parsing and formatting
the sysfs file. In the end the drivers are only interested in getting
a bunch of values to write to the hardware.

I was thinking about adding another file (wakeup_protocol sounds good)
which would tell what semantics are used to interpret the contents of
wakeup_code file (rc6, rc5, nec or raw). Would this be a decent
solution?

The other alternative is to push the sysfs handling to individual
drivers. I'm ok with either way. Which one should I pursue?
