Not likely, but it might be possible.

I'll be out the rest of this week due to a travel for a series of meetings
at the office.

I might not be able to prepare another pull request until next week. After
having it done, I should wait for a couple days for it to be at -next, but
then it will almost be Xmas. Let's see.

Mauro
