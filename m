Yes, that's my concern.

I also want to cover the case where there are two drivers involved, as
this is a typical trouble we need to do with all devices that have both
analog and digital TV's.

A typical media device exposes several different API's to userspace,
each with its own character device, and sometimes implemented by a
different driver.

For example, Conexant cx23102 USB chipsets provide 2 USB interfaces,
but require 3 different drivers, and exposes 4 different userspace
API's to userspace:

USB interface 0: Remote Controller
	event/input API - Handled by drivers/media/rc/mceusb.c

USB interface 1: Audio/Video
	ALSA API - Handled by drivers/media/video/cx231xx/cx231xx-audio.c
		It is a separate driver, called cx231xx-alsa
	V4L2 API - Handled by drivers/media/video/cx231xx/cx231xx-video.c
	DVB API - Handled by drivers/media/video/cx231xx/cx231xx-dvb.c
		Both DVB and V4L2 are currently part of the same driver
(cx231xx).

The mceusb is completely independent of the other drivers. The cx231xx-alsa
also is almost independent. It only shares a lock with the main cx231xx
driver, and uses the I2C functions implemented by the main driver.

Now, we're starting to see devices like ZTE MF845 that have TV, 3G and 
USB storage, exposing 2 more userspace API's to userspace (vfs and tty).

I don't think that userspace usb_modeswitch-like type of locking "scales"
such complex devices.

Besides that, on a large amount of USB sticks, if you enable both V4L2
and DVB, the power consumption may exceed the 500mA power limit of USB,
and can overheat the device. There are several reports of burnt devices
due to that. Also, there's no way for both to work, as they share the
same tuner, that can either be tuning an analog or a digital channel.

To me, the right solution seems to add some sort of locking schema that
will protect the common resources on complex hardware. Something like:

int get_hw_resource(struct device, enum hw_resource_type);
void put_hw_resource(struct device, enum hw_resource_type);

enum hw_resource_type {
	HW_RES_USB,
	HW_RES_I2C,
	HW_RES_TUNER,
	HW_RES_USB,
...
};

So that, when a device need, for example, an exclusive lock for the USB
device, for example, it could be doing something like:

rc = get_hw_resource(dev, HW_RES_USB);
if (rc < 0)
	return -EBUSY;

and, after finishing, doing a put_hw_resource().
