I think a free form note saying this out loud in a visible place should be
enough. A note should also be added to
Documentation/DocBook/media/v4l/compat.xml to the section "Experimental API
Elements".

Speaking of this, we seem to have quite a few of these that probably
shouldn't be experimental anymore, such as VIDIOC_ENUM_FRAMESIZES.
Interestingly enough, VIDIOC_ENUM_FRAMEINTERVALS no longer is experimental.
I think I'll send a patch for this.

That's my understanding, but of course someone could just say "no" when we
try to do that. I think that if something is marked experimental at least
the argument that it can't be changed is a little bit moot since the users
have been notified of this beforehand.

There are a few examples of this. At least the V4L2 subdev and MC interfaces
are marked experimental. However, we haven't actually tried to use that to
make changes which might break user space since we haven't got a need to.

Hans, Laurent: do you have an opinion on this?
