Ah, I was not aware of that, and I forgot to test for that case.

I agree with all your points above; however, I was unsure of whether a wholesale
cleanup would be welcomed because I would then end up touching numerous lines
(and in some cases, possibly all lines). I did notice, though, the need for
quite a bit of cleanup like you have mentioned, and I have a few patches queued
up that make a second pass on some files changing <module>-objs to
<module>-y. You know better than I do, so if you feel I should cleanup the whole
file in one patch, then that is what I will do although this will take some
time.

Is the use of <module>-objs deprecated? Some people might wonder why I am
changing that when they are not building a multisource object.

Thanks,
