No, he's making a bigger mess, and didn't I just make another
suggestion?

Is that a qualified statement that, yes, that is the only inclusion
path?

No, that will result in non-compilation due to wait_queue_head_t usage.

If you'd applied your brain for a second before hitting reply you'd have
noticed that at this point you'd (likely) be able to include sched.h
from wait.h. which is the right way about, you need to be able to
schedule in order to build waitqueues.
