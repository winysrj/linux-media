Thanks for the hint, I will try to investigate this more.
I didn't know this because the old scan from dvb-apps have seemed to 
find channels even with this simpler Satellite scan data that comes 
withing dvb-apps for Astra.

Could you or somebody else give me an example from the satellite conf file 
where all those fields are filled in? I am little confused from those 
parameters.

How about the channel data generated by the scan-s2 or scan with "-o vdr" 
option. Should I also make some changes to those manually?

I think there must however be a bug either in scan-s2 or hvr-4000 S2API 
driver, if it's will start scanning even if the given input data is 
invalid. I mean that I think the driver and S2API should "hide away" the 
differences between different S/S2 chipsets in a way that same data given 
by the user space application should be acceptable for any card/s2-driver.

Is the bug in the scan-s2 not handling the error message from the driver 
about using "AUTO" values, or is the bug in the driver not "correctly" 
returning the error when all data needed is not set?
