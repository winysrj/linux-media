right, I missed that. So this version is still valid one. The v2 that I 
already sent should be dropped.

I noticed that there are some driver like ov772x, ov9640 and etc, are 
not supported the async probe yet.
If we return the EPROBE_DEFER for all v4l2_clk_get(), that will cause 
the no-async probe function work incorrectly.
So IMO we can do your above suggestion after all sensors support async 
probe.

Thanks.
