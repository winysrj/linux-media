I doubt that this is the cause. It could be some race condition between
the main em28xx driver and some other one (we had this issue in the past).

Also, there's no situation at xc3028 driver where ENODEV is returned.
So, this is likely at em28xx-i2c, where this error is returned when the
physical device doesn't answer to an I2C xfer.
