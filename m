The discussion has been centered around devices that do actually need
that work queue for sleepless operation. Naturally, if the work queue
isn't required by a particular device, it should not be used.

What we'd prefer to avoid here is drivers having to implement two ways
(synchronoys and potentially asynchronous) to perform the same actions
(for V4L2 and LED API, respectively).
