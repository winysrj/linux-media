Agreed.

The lru lock removal patch fixed the delayed delete code, it really is not different from the current
situation. In fact it is more clear without the guarantee what various parts are trying to protect.

Nothing prevents you from holding the lru_lock while trylocking,
leaving that guarantee intact for that part. Can you really just review
the patch and tell me where it breaks and/or makes the code unreadable?

See my preemptive reply to patch 1/5 for details. I would prefer you
followup there. :-)
