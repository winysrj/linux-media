It is a raw bayer sensor, isn't it?

It is also possible to expose these controls just for this sensor, but I
would wait a little bit if that's okay for you. Your sensor driver isn't the
only one depending on these new controls --- Laurent also has one.

I don't think this should take too long, but I can't promise that. :-)

If you want the driver to mainline fast, then you could also submit it
without these controls implemented, and implement them in another patch when
the controls have been standardised.

That's correct. I think the COLORFX hasn't been very well documented so far,
but it should be. I don't think many know what the solarize effect would do.
:-) I think the patch should also add that. The user control documentation
may be found in Documentation/DocBook/media/v4l/controls.xml .
