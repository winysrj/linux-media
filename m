No. Previously, the init_regs were manually breaking the 0x39 register initialization
on several calls to tda18271_write_regs().

What the patch did were to move the logic of breaking the data into smaller groups
to happen inside tda18271_write_regs().

So, while the old logic broke it on 3 writes, being the first one from registers
0x00 to 0x0f, the second from 0x10 to 0x1f and the third from 0x20 to 0x27, the new
code breaks it inside tda18271_write_regs().

The old logic is broken, since there are some parts of the code calling tda18271_write_regs()
with a size that were bigger than the maximum supported size.

If you take a look at the code, before this patch, you'll see places where more than the maximum
allowed size is used. For example:

http://git.linuxtv.org/media_tree.git?a=blob;f=drivers/media/common/tuners/tda18271-common.c;h=e1f678281a58d327752dfcf24dc72ccf1d93ff79;hb=1724c8fa7eb33d68898e060a08a8e6a88348b62f#l385

The driver is wring 11 values:
	tda18271_write_regs(fe, R_EP3, 11);

This doesn't honor the max size of 8 bytes, if small_i2c = TDA18271_08_BYTE_CHUNK_INIT.

My patch basically did:

1) it moved the logic that restricts the maximum size to be inside tda18271_write_regs();
2) it added a new max size of 4 bytes;
3) It renamed the magic values associated with small_i2c.

Basically, af9015 broke due to (3), as .small_i2c = 1 means nothing. It should be using
.small_i2c = TDA18271_16_BYTE_CHUNK_INIT, instead.

What I don't understand is why a patch doing this change didn't fix the issue. Please
test the patch I posted on the original -next thread. Let's try to identify why
tda18271_write_regs() is not breaking the data into smaller writes.

Cheers,
Mauro
