I really appreciate your email.

Believe me that Mauro's NACK is not reason for me to stop work on vtuner.
Fortunatelly the code is very compact and not need for any kernel patching
so doing out-of-tree development is possible and works very well.

I hope for one day when the code gets accepted somehow. In the meantime
I'm going to place some notes about development progress time to time here.
Next time w/o any word regarding code inclusion :-)

Regards

Honza
