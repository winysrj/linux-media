That's my opinion too: deprecate it before it gets (ab)used.

We can't move it before the union, as it would otherwise break userspace.
The union should contain both the new name and the legacy ones.

Moving the reserved fields out of the union seems fine for me.

That's somewhat true, but all device nodes are the points where the hardware
can be controlled. Any userspace software that needs to control the hardware
need some way to detect the device nodes, in order to use them

As I said, it is, in practice, more than just the DMA, even for V4L2. It
is the control point of the device to where an specific API is used to
control the hardware.

Btw, calling them as DMA is a simplification. On simple devices, yes
there's a DMA directly associated with the devnode, but on devices like
USB, the DMA is actually hidden, and a piece of software at the Kernel
filters out the payload from the USB headers.

So, a devnode is actually several blocks:

	[hw control] or, eventually, [kernel control]
	[DMA] ---> [payload filter] ---> [userspace stream I/O]

A subdev node is actually:
	[hw control] or, eventually, [kernel control]

I agree that they should be reported via the MC API.

Well, for me a devnode has always an API associated to it, as all devnodes
allow some set of ioctls to use to control it.

So, for me, each media entity that is a devnode should have a property or
identity that will tell what API is supported there. This is so important
for userspace that I would keep using "type" for that.

Ok, some devnodes have more than just [hw control].

Agreed.

Agreed.

Fully agreed.

I'm fine with such change.

Well, this is actually a simplification. It works fine for now, but
we'll need to go deeper in some future to properly describe the DVB
pipeline.

The frontend is actually composed of two parts:
	- A tuner;
	- A digital TV demodulator.

(On some devices, it is impossible to distinguish between them,
as the tuner is controlled by the firmware inside the demod)

The demodulator has a serial or parallel bus that either sends
the data to a hardware demux or sends it to the Kernel via DMA.

In the first case, the diagram is:

	[tuner] ---> [demod] --> [hw demux] --> [DMA] --> Kernel --> userspace (either via dmx or dvr devnode)

In the second case, it is:

	[tuner] ---> [demod] --> [DMA] --> Kernel --> [sw demux in Kernel] --> userspace (either via dmx or dvr devnode)

The DMA is thus hidden in the middle of the pipeline.

For userspace, it doesn't matter if the hardware has or not a demux.
The logic is that the DVB Demux API is used to set a filter at the
demux.

The demux filter will select the packet IDs (PID) that userspace
wants from the MPEG-TS stream, and either dynamically wire the hardware
to send the selected program via DMA (for hardware demux) or it will
program the Kernel to filter it in kernelspace.

Btw, the above diagrams are for PC typical hardware. For Set Top Boxes
and TV sets, in order to meet DRM (Digital Rights Management)
requirements at the DVB specs, they may not have any DMA engine. In
such case, the demuxed video should be passed to a CA module (CAM), that
handles the decrypt, and then the output should go to the video adapter
for display.

So, the diagram would be something like:

	[tuner] ---> [demod] --> [hw demux] --> [CAM] --> [/dev/fb0]

In such case, all device nodes are just for hardware control.

To make things a little worse, it is not [hw demux] but, actually
[hw demux filter #0] ... [[hw demux filter #n].

A typical PC hardware with hw demux implements something like 32 filters.

A TV set hardware supports a way more filters and some can even have
dynamically created filters that can be shared between different DVB adapters.

I see your point.

A dvr interface is always associated with the stream output to userspace.

Yes. it is hw/sw control and can be stream output too.

Actually, the processing unity can have one sink pad with the TS input, and
a dynamically created number of PADs, one for each filter.

Please notice that a filter is associated with a file descriptor, and not
with a devnode.

So, from devnode perspective, we have:

	/dev/adapter0/frontend0 - to control the tuner/demod
	/dev/adapter0/demux0 - to create the filters
	/dev/adapter0/dvr0 - to receive the data
	/dev/adapter0/ca0 - to control data decrypt

but, from the data flux, we have:

	frontend0 -> demux0 input pad

	demux0 output pad filter 0 --> DMA --> dvr0 fd 5 
	demux0 output pad filter 1 --> DMA --> dvr0 fd 6
	demux0 output pad filter 2 --> DMA --> dvr0 fd 7
	demux0 output pad filter 3 --> ca0 --> DMA --> dvr0 fd 8
	demux0 output pad filter 4 --> /dev/fb0
	...

So, what we're really mapping right now is the hardware/software
control points associated with the device nodes. So, the way I see
is that we'll still need to represent at the media controller
the device nodes as such, as this is the point where the hardware
(and the Kernel) can be controlled.

The data flux can be simplified as we're doing right now, but we'll
need to add more features at the media controller (and to better
discuss) how to implement the DVB data flux.

In other words, for DVB, we'll need to represent:

- all devnodes used to control the DVB API (that's the goal of the
  current patchset);

- the demux processing unit with their filter outputs and the userspace
  file descriptors. I intend to discuss this further during the
  Media summit, and should be object of another set of patches.
