Right.

I've checked the documentation about the gpio and led frameworks a few
weeks ago to find out if it makes sense to use them for the
gpio/buttons/led stuff of the VAD Laplace webcam.
AFAICS, there are no benfits as long as you are dealing with these
things internally. It just increases the code size and adds an
additional dependency in this case.
Of course, the situation is different when there is an interaction with
other modules or userspace. In that case using gpiolib could make sense.
I don't know which case applies to the LAN stuff, but for the
buttons/leds it's the first case.

Frank
