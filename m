I'm writing to ask about any DVB staff for notebook. I know many 
models haven't any working drivers, due to many reasons. The 
question is: Are there any preety good DVB cards which i can use? 
Which one do you prefere? I don't expect a new model witch DVB-
S2. It may be an older model. It should be only usable on linux.

I will be very pleased for any anwsers.

Best Regards.
Dominik Sito
