Eric,

If you find an error at the wiki pages or some legacy information, please help us
to maintain it by editing them! It is a huge work to keep the drivers updated, consuming
lots of the developers available time, and generally done after hours. We simply don't 
have time to also keep the wiki updated ;)

We count on the LinuxTV users community to help us with the wiki.

So, be welcome to improve the wiki and to fix any issues there. If you find a bug outside
the wiki pages, feel free to send me an email pointing the issues, and proposing a
new text to fix the issue
 
> Thanks for the good work anyway,

Thanks,
Mauro
