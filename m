Hans,

First of all I'm very sorry that I had not enough time to go through  
your new RFC. I'll checkout right after posting this mail.

I think this is a good approach and I also had in my mind that sysfs  
might be a good method if we could control and monitor through this.  
Recalling memory when we had a talk in San Francisco, I was frustrated  
that there is no way to catch events from sort of sub-devices like  
lens actuator (I mean pizeo motors in camera module). As you know lens  
actuator is an extremely slow device in comparison with common v4l2  
devices we are using and we need to know whether it has succeeded or  
not in moving to expected position.
So I considered sysfs and udev as candidates for catching events from  
sub-devices. events like success/failure of lens movement, change of  
status of subdevices.
Does anybody experiencing same issue? I think I've seen a lens  
controller driver in omap3 kernel from TI but not sure how did they  
control that.

My point is that we need a kind of framework to give and event to user  
space and catching them properly just like udev does.
Cheers,

Nate
