Not sure what you meant here. Currently, there is support already
for multiple subdevs attached to a driver.

As we're talking here about kAPI, it is quite common that a V4L2 the
need to set multiple devices while stream. A typical non-MC device like
bttv can set up to 4 types of devices:
	- tuner;
	- audio decoder;
	- video decoder;
	- video enhancers.

In the case of non-MC devices, it is the bridge driver that it is
responsible to pass a "broadcast" message to all subdevices for
them to be at "stream mode".

You should define what you mean by "transmitter".

Why the sub-device? Even in the MC case, the stream on operation is
usually called via the v4l devnode, where the DMA engine is.

what "drivers" are encouraged not to ...?

What is a transmitter? There are only two places inside kAPI that
uses the word "transmitter":
	Documentation/media/kapi/cec-core.rst
	Documentation/media/kapi/csi2.rst

On both documents, the meaning of the term is clear, but I can't
understand what you mean by "transmitter" at the subdev's core
documentation. Is it the tuner? the bridge driver? a CSI bus?
the DMA engine? all of them?
