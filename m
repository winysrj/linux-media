I agree with the above.

However, I also think we should just go forward with the bidirectional
links for now. The bindings for bidir links are already in the mainline
kernel, so they can't be seen as broken.

When we have an agreement about the direction, and we've got common
parsing code, it's trivial to convert the existing links to single
direction links, and the old dts files with bidir links continue to work
fine.

This is what I'm planning to do with OMAP display subsystem, as I
_really_ want to get the DT support merged for 3.15. The current mix of
pdata + DT that we have for OMAP display is an unmaintainable mess.

So unless I get a nack from someone (I've pinged Grant twice about
this), or someone explains why it's a bad idea, I'll push the OMAP
display bindings [1] for 3.15 with bidir bindings, and change them to
single-dir later.

Note that I did remove the abbreviated endpoint format that I had there
earlier, so now the bindings are fully compatible with the v4l2 bindings.=
