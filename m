We need to fix that issue with af9015, but, without this patch, cx231xx is broken, as it
doesn't accept more than 4 bytes per I2C transfer. I tested the patch here with some possible
restrictions for I2C size. Also, Mkrufky tested it with other different hardware.

What I don't understand is that the only change that this patch caused for af9015 is to change
the I2C max size that used to be 16. The patch I sent you reverted this behaviour, by using
the proper macro value, instead of a magic number, but you reported that this didn't fix your
problem.

So, we need to figure out what af9015 is doing different than the other patches, and add patch 
the issue with af9015. It shouldn't be hard to fix. I'll keep working with you in order to solve
the issue, although I don't have any af90xx hardware here, so, I need your help with the tests.

Cheers,
Mauro.
