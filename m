Good evening,

at first I want to say thanks for your work in linux tv. Why I disturb
you... I am working on driver for AverTV Volar HD PRO (A835), USB card
for DVB-TV. At least, I am trying to make it. But still with no
success. I know the chip, demodulator and tuner, but thats all.
Everything I did, didnt helped. So I only want to ask you, if you ever
have anything to do with this card? Or are you worked with it? I just
cant make it working, so I will be glad for any hint.

Sorry for disturbing, and thanks for replying.

Regards, Michal Bojda.
