Please note that this has partly changed a couple of years ago with the=
=20
introduction of the media controller framework. Userspace now opens a l=
ogical=20
media device that describes the topology of the hardware, and then acce=
sses=20
individual components directly, from sensor to DMA engine.

The logical view of a device from a CPU perspective evolves over time, =
as APIs=20
are refactored or created to support new hardware that comes with new=20=

paradigms and additional complexity. The hardware data flow direction,=20=

however, doesn't change. Only modeling the data flow direction in DT mi=
ght be=20
tempting but is probably too hasty of a conclusion though : if DT shoul=
d model=20
the hardware, it ends up modeling a logical view of the hardware, and i=
s thus=20
not as closed as one might believe.

In the particular case of display devices I believe that using the data=
 flow=20
direction for links (assuming we can't use bidirectional links in DT) i=
s a=20
good model. It would allow parsing the whole graph at a reasonable cost=
 (still=20
higher than with bidirectional links) while making clear how to represe=
nt=20
links. Let's not forgot that with more complex devices not all componen=
ts can=20
be referenced directly from the CPU-side display controller.

Even if the link was unidirectional the "outward from SoC" direction is=
n't=20
always defined for links between non-SoC devices.
