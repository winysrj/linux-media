I wonder if the current V4L2_PIX_FMT_H264* fourcc formats support multiple slices
in one buffer. Kamil might know. But I suspect you'll have to make a new fourcc
for that. Just for reference you might want to look at VIDIOC_G_ENC_INDEX (used
by ivtv) for a somewhat similar purpose. It's an old API, and I would probably not
recommend reusing this, but it may be interesting.

Is the size of the gaps programmable in the H.264 encoder hardware?

In any case, I believe your particular use-case has absolutely nothing to do with
headers/footers in a plane (the original topic). Your headers are intrinsic to the
format, i.e. without them applications cannot handle the stream. Filling those in
is the responsibility of the whole stack (driver + any libv4l plugin) leading to a
valid data buffer.

The headers/footers in the original use-case are just due to metadata that hardware
decides to throw in for whoever is interested (or in some cases it's just garbage)
and that are not part of the actual image data.
