Jean-Francois, 

If you do not mind, tell me more about the "some changes." More cameras? 
Or something else? 

Someone in the family has been quite sick for the last several months, 
which has taken a lot of my time and energy and may do so in the future, 
too. I have not had the time to do much more than to look at the mail I 
get every day, much less to continue work on related projects. Several 
things that I wanted to do months ago are sitting incomplete and in limbo 
waiting for me to be less busy and preoccupied.

But I have not lost interest.

Wishing for you and for all of us a peaceful and prosperous year 2011.

Theodore Kilgore
