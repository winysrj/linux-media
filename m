It looks that the CMA patch series reached the final version - I've just 
posted version 21 a few minutes ago. Most of the patches got acks from either 
Mel or Arnd and the remaining few needs only minor tweaking, but they affect
only CMA users, which we hope to fix once the series is merged. That's why I
would like to ask You to merge these patches to Your tree and finally give
them a try in linux-next kernel.

Best regards
