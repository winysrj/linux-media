No worries.

I'll send patches.

Another small comment. The map_dma_buf operation is defined as

        struct sg_table * (*map_dma_buf)(struct dma_buf_attachment *,
                                                enum dma_data_direction);

If we want to let exporters cache the sg_table we should return a const struct 
sg_table *. unmap_dma_buf will then take a const pointer as well, which would 
need to be cast to a non-const pointer internally. What's your opinion on that 
?
