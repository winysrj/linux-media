I see your concerns, but I really wonder how to determine the properties
of the global/default cma pool. You definitely don't want to give all
available memory o CMA, because it will have negative impact on kernel
operation (kernel really needs to allocate unmovable pages from time to
time). 

The only solution I see now is to provide Kconfig entry to determine
the size of the global CMA pool, but this still have some issues,
especially for multi-board kernels (each board probably will have
different amount of RAM and different memory-consuming devices
available). It looks that each board startup code still might need to
tweak the size of CMA pool. I can add a kernel command line option for
it, but such solution also will not solve all the cases (afair there
was a discussion about kernel command line parameters for memory 
configuration and the conclusion was that it should be avoided).
