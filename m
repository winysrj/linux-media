I don't have a strong preference here.

If I remember my computer architecture books, back on the old days, 
everything that does I/O is technically a peripheral to the CPU. That
seems, btw, the definition used by Wikipedia:

	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peripheral

So, calling it as peripheral works.

On the other hand, "V4L2 hardware" doesn't seem an adequate term,
as it associates a software API with a piece of hardware. It is
weirder when the hardware have an hybrid tuner, as the same hardware
is visible via both DVB and V4L2 APIs. Yet, we could find a similar
wording, like "media hardware".

I'm OK to replace it to something like "media hardware", but, I
prefer to do such change on a patch to be applied after this series,
in order to minimize the rebase needs[1].

[1] as you noticed on patch 6/7, with all those nomenclature changes,
one of the places were written as "v4l2-centric" instead of "vdev-centric"
as on the other patches. That's basically the problem with rebases: we
end by letting loose ends. So, IMHO, if we end by deciding to rename
	A->B
	C->D
Let's do it on a separate patch at the end of the series, as a simple
grep |sed -i could replace all occurrences at once without letting
lose ands and without needing to solve patch merge conflicts.

Ok, I'll drop it.

I'll submit a v5 soon, without the terms renaming. If we all agree
with renaming terms, I'll produce a separate patch fixing it where
used.
