In theory unidirectional links in DT are indeed enough. However, let's =
not=20
forget the following.

=2D There's no such thing as single start points for graphs. Sure, in som=
e=20
simple cases the graph will have a single start point, but that's not a=
=20
generic rule. For instance the camera graphs=20
http://ideasonboard.org/media/omap3isp.ps and=20
http://ideasonboard.org/media/eyecam.ps have two camera sensors, and th=
us two=20
starting points from a data flow point of view. And if you want a bette=
r=20
understanding of how complex media graphs can become, have a look at=20=

http://ideasonboard.org/media/vsp1.0.pdf (that's a real world example, =
albeit=20
all connections are internal to the SoC in that particular case, and do=
n't=20
need to be described in DT).

=2D There's also no such thing as a master device that can just point to =
slave=20
devices. Once again simple cases exist where that model could work, but=
 real=20
world examples exist of complex pipelines with dozens of elements all=20=

implemented by a separate IP core and handled by separate drivers, form=
ing a=20
graph with long chains and branches. We thus need real graph bindings.

=2D Finally, having no backlinks in DT would make the software implementa=
tion=20
very complex. We need to be able to walk the graph in a generic way wit=
hout=20
having any of the IP core drivers loaded, and without any specific star=
ting=20
point. We would thus need to parse the complete DT tree, looking at all=
 nodes=20
and trying to find out whether they're part of the graph we're trying t=
o walk.=20
The complexity of the operation would be at best quadratic to the numbe=
r of=20
nodes in the whole DT and to the number of nodes in the graph.

=2D-=20
