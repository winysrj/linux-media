I first wrote my version after observing that performance dropped by a
factor of three on the OLPC XO 1.75 when using contiguous, coherent
memory.  If the architecture needs to turn off caching, things really slow
down, to the point that it's unusable.  There's no real reason why a V4L2
device shouldn't be able to use streaming mappings in this situation; it
performs better and doesn't eat into the limited amounts of coherent DMA
space available on some systems.

I never got my version into a mergeable state only because I finally
figured out how to bludgeon the hardware into doing s/g DMA and didn't
need it anymore.  But I think it's a worthwhile functionality to have,
and, with CMA, it could be the preferred mode for a number of devices.
