Hi all,


hope you can help me this one, because there's not a whole of info about 
similar problems to be found.

I have a Technotrend S2-3200 with CI and on three different distros I 
get this

"dvb_ca adaptor 0: PC card did not respond :(


in /var/log/messages.

I guess this is the reason why I cannot see encrypted channels on Linux. 
Unencrypted works fine. In Windows XP the cord works fine too.

I tried Opensuse 11.4, the latest Mythbuntu and the latest Mythdora.

Can anyone give any hints on how to go about this?


thx!!!

Bart
