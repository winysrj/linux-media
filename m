(I've cc'ed the LMML to reach the wider audience nowadays)

These are good suggestions that Henrik has made. I would encourage
others to also step up and try to find ways to implement them (along
with any other improvements that can be made to the wiki and other
sources of V4L-DVB documentation and website -- the website, in
particular, really could stand for an overhaul).

(Note - at present I do not have time to take on further work, nor do I
personally really want the responsibility of being the point man for
such changes ... as it stands, I'm interested only in finishing off
ventures I commenced long ago ... or introducing changes that are
personally enjoyable to myself to make)

I also note that from prior discussions with Henrik and Jim (and Henrik
is absolutely correct that discussing things from within the wiki
quickly becomes difficult to follow), and from prior times with Micheal
and Devin on irc, that we were touching upon the idea of a database. One
such example that I recently came across, and that is worth further
investigation by someone (and, again, that someone does not include me),
is that model used by dd-wrt for their supported hardware (i would link,
but it appears that their server is down at the moment).
