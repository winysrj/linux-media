I had a detailed discussion with the firmware team regarding this and
updated them the concerns. The need to do it is because, the register
offsets are grouped codec-wise. Like
0x000a H264
0x000d MPEG4
0x000f VP8
etc.

There are some holes given for future register additions also, but
sometimes many additional features are added to specific codecs and also
in the common feature set which doesnt fit in the pre-defined holes. So
as per them, the re-shuffle of registers was done in v8 so as to make it
more clean and taking into consideration future feature requirements.
But again it might have few changes here and there in the next version.
Since these register offsets are not really in our control, this
approach is best in the driver to absorb these changes without many if -
else conditions. The firware team assured me that they will try to avoid
these kind of changes as much as possible in future.

Arun
