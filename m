Perhaps your comments would carry more credibility if you would
provide your full name and the number of commits you have made to the
v4l-dvb codebase in the last year.

This is a open source developers list, which generally makes it a
meritocracy.  If Mauro were actually incompetent, I am quite confident
that the developers who are *actively committing code* would not stand
for it.  The reality is though that the people who work with him on a
regular basis are in most cases the same people who have backed the
S2API proposal.  It's not a coincidence that the same people that
supported the proposal are major contributors to the project.

Are there communication/personality issues?  Certainly.  However,
unless you are actively contributing code to the project, please leave
the developers to work through this issue without your help.

Thank you,

Devin Heitmueller
