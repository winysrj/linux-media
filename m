Aleksandr,

No.


At first glance, this patch doesn't look safe for all ivtv boards so:

	Naked-by: Andy Walls <awalls@radix.net>


In ivtv-i2c.c I see:

	#define IVTV_MSP3400_I2C_ADDR           0x40

It is probably not good to assume that only an IR microcontroller could
be at I2C address 0x40 for a CX2341x adapter.

I will work up an ivtv specific change similar to what I did in
cx18-cards.c and cx18-i2c.c for IR on the HVR-1600 for bringing up the
IR for the M116 cards alone.

What kernel version do you use?

Regards,
Andy
