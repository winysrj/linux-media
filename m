I'll see if I can find time, disabling it seems faster then implementing support for it, specially that current experiment show that the jpeg code is really fragile. Current state is that libv4l2 is causing a buffer overflow, so it is harmful library in that sense.

Hmm, is that jpeg overflow still there with my recent (aprok 2-3 weeks ago) fix
for this?

Yes, which is not good.

I think that trying to bold support for all of this into libv4l2 is not necessarily
a good idea. Then again if we're going to use libv4l2 plugins to do things like
media-controller pipeline setups for apps which are not media-controller aware,
maybe it is ...

libv4l2 was mostly created to get the then current generation of v4l2 apps to work
with webcams which have funky formats without pushing fmt conversion into the kernel
as several out of tree drivers were doing.

It may be better to come up with a better API for libv4lconvert, and let apps which
want to do advanced stuff deal with conversion themselves, while keeping all the
conversion code in a central place, but that does leave the media-controller issue.

Note that I've aprox. 0 time to work on libv4l now a days ...

What we really need is an active libv4l maintainer. Do not get me wrong, Gregor
has been doing a great job at maintaining it, but if we want to do some architectural
rework (or just a complete rewrite) I think we need someone who knows the v4l2 API,
media-controller, etc. a lot better.

Regards,

Hans
