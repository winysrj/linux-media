:(

I didn't notice that weird I2C attach code on this driver.

Akihiro, could you please fix it? The entire I2C attach code at
pt3_attach looks weird. We should soon add support for the I2C
tuner attach code for all DVB drivers on a common place, just like
what we do for V4L drivers. That's why I didn't spend much time on
that piece of the code.

Yet, while we don't have it, please take a look at 
drivers/media/v4l2-core/v4l2-device.c and do (almost) the same on
your driver, if possible, putting the I2C load module on a function.
That will make easier for us to replace such function when we'll add 
core support for it. The function at v4l2-device for you to take
a look is: v4l2_device_register_subdev().

Thank you,
Mauro
