OK, I'll refer to bus instead.

agreed its just a one liner, and below I have mentioned a link
to video-interfaces.txt for better understanding of this generic
properties.

How about the below description ?

Active-high Field ID output polarity control. Under normal operation, the
field ID output is set to logic 1 for an odd field (field 1)
and set to logic 0 for an even field (field 0).
0 = Normal operation (default)
1 = FID output polarity inverted

Agreed I'll add them to optional list, and mention their default values too.
