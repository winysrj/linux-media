If the "driver version" is in fact an ABI version, then the driver author
should really increase it only when ABI behavior is changed (and only if
the behavior change can only be communicated by version number --- e.g.
addition of an ioctl is not among such reasons).  And the author should
commit behavior changing implementation and version number change in a
single changeset.

And anybody who backmerges such an ABI behavior change into another kernel
branch (stable, longterm, distro...) must backmerge the associated version
number change too.

Of course sometimes people realize this only after the fact.  Or driver
authors don't have a clear understanding of ABI versioning to begin with.
I am saying so because I had to learn it too; I certainly wasn't born
with an instinct knowledge how to do it properly.

(Disclaimer:  I have no stake in drivers/media/ ABIs.  But I am involved
in maintaining a userspace ABI elsewhere in drivers/firewire/, and one of
the userspace libraries that use this ABI.)
