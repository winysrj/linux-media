It might not now, but if the bound calculation changes later, I'm pretty sure 
we'll forget to update the speculation barrier macro at least in some cases. 
Without the help of static (or possibly dynamic) code analysis I think we're 
bound to reintroduce problems over time, but that's true for finding places 
where the barrier is needed, not just for barrier selection based on bound 
calculation.
