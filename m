Subject: [Job posting] Linux software developer with experience with the Video4Linux2
 API / ALSA
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=ISO-8859-1; format=flowed

Note, before posting this I asked in the #v4l channel on freenode if a 
(single) announcement for a job posting would be acceptable.  I was told 
that it should be okay, so if it's against the policy let me know (I do 
apologize if it is).

We are looking for a Linux software developer for our Linux based 
surveillance application (www.bluecherrydvr.com).  This reason I'm 
posting this on the linux-media mailing list is because our application 
uses the Video4Linux and ALSA APIs for accessing video / audio.  We 
recently released a open source MPEG-4 / H.264 driver (see links below), 
and since our application uses this driver we are in need of developers 
with extensive knowledge with Video4Linux and ALSA to extend our 
application.  This position would also handle IP camera integration, 
which is not directly related to the V4L.

The complete job posting with more specific requirements is here: 
http://jobview.monster.com/Linux-video-surveillance-software-developer-Video4Linux-ALSA-Job-Fulton-MO-US-91967697.aspx?fwr=true

If you have any questions please email me off-list (email address is 
below) as not to crowd up the mailing list.

Telecommuting is an option for this position.

Thanks!
