Thanks, I'll re-pull it shortly.  The other good news is that I've thrown
your patches on top of the previous pull, merged them into my test tree
and everything seems to work as it should on the SolidRun Hummingboard.

What base have you used for those imx-drm patches?  I assume it would
be something like a merge of my imx-drm commits and the of-graph branch?

Let me put this a different way: I'd be happy to pull those changes if
they're sensibly based in your git tree.

Thanks.
