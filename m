Yeah, completely agree. On my TODO list (but rather far down) is 
actually supporting P2P with USB devices.

And no, I don't have the slightest idea how to do this at the moment.

Agree as well. I was also in clear favor of extending the SGLs to have a 
flag for this instead of the dma_map_resource() interface, but for some 
reason that didn't made it into the kernel.

At least to me that sounds like a good idea, it would at least disable 
(the incorrect) auto detection of P2P for such devices.

Well it is not only rejecting P2P, see the devices I need to worry about 
are essentially part of the CPU. Their resources looks like a PCI BAR to 
the BIOS and OS, but are actually backed by stolen system memory.

So as crazy as it sounds what you get is an operation which starts as 
P2P, but then the GPU drivers sees it and says: Hey please don't write 
that to my PCIe BAR, but rather system memory location X.

A fact that gives me quite some sleepless nights as well. I think we 
sooner or later need to extend those interfaces to work with DMA-bufs as 
well.

I will try to give your patch set a review when I'm back from vacation 
and rebase my DMA-buf work on top of that.

Christian.
