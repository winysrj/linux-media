Hi,

	I am working on project for monitoring analog FM radio stations in our 
Country and I need to find USB device which is supported under Linux 
including FM radio. I can't find such device for very long time (6 
months), only AverTV Volar HX with binary drivers and very unstable 
linux drivers.

So I am considering to pay for analog FM radio support for dib0700 devices.

+ I need this support in next 25 days, later is too late.
+ I can pay for adding FM radio maximum 1000 USD or 800 EUR (it depends 
on many factors such as accepting patches by linuxtv tree).

If there is anyone intereseted please write me message.
