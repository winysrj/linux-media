The vtunerc has the same issues. High latency (due to high loads,  high
latency links or whatever) affects it badly, and may cause application
breakages if if the device is opened are using O_NONBLOCK mode [1].

[1] Btw, if some DVB ioctl currently waits in O_NONBLOCK, this is a POSIX
violation that needs to be fixed.
