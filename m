Nick has decided he wants to be a kernel developer, a laudable goal.

He however has decided not to take any advice given to me by a number of other
kernel developers on how to work on the kernel. So instead he sends random
broken patches to random subsystems in the hope that one will slip past a sleepy
maintainer and end up in the kernel.

He isn't willing to spend his own time learning anything, he is
expecting that kernel
developers want to spoon feed someone who sends them broken patches.

We've asked him to stop, he keeps doing it, then when caught out apologizes
with something along the lines, of I'm trying to learn, "idiot
mistake", despite having
been told to take a step back and try and learn how the kernel works.

Now we have to waste more maintainer time making sure nobody accidentally
merges anything he sends.

Dave.
