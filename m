I guess the signal probably is just continuous repetition High/Low like PWM signal,
which is generated by the core of sensor module.  Although I don't check what signal
it is, it's very possible. Because it's the only way to be able to control intensity of  Flash.

So, I think the torch and flash case is the same way or signal in this case.

Probably you mean media controller framework is based on. I get it. :)

Thanks for plus reply. I've tested tony's patch for booting the ubuntu long time ago,
but I'm sure this gadget is good device.
