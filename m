Yeah, the normal usage is to use R/W syscalls.

>From the ca_msg struct:

	/* a message to/from a CI-CAM */
	struct ca_msg {
		unsigned int index;
		unsigned int type;
		unsigned int length;
		unsigned char msg[256];
	};

It only uses length and msg fields. Describing those seem
quite obvious. However, what "index" and "type" means?

Within the Kernel, only two drivers implement it:

	$ git grep -l ca_msg drivers/
	drivers/media/firewire/firedtv-ci.c
	drivers/media/pci/bt8xx/dst_ca.c

At the dst_ca driver, checking for those fields don't give any
useful result:
	$ grep index drivers/media/pci/bt8xx/dst_ca.c
	(nothing)
	$ grep type drivers/media/pci/bt8xx/dst_ca.c
	// Copy application_type, application_manufacturer and manufacturer_code
	p_ca_caps->slot_type = 1;
	p_ca_caps->descr_type = 1;
		p_ca_slot_info->type = CA_CI;
		p_ca_slot_info->type = CA_CI;

(btw, using "1" for slot_type and descr_type there seems a very bad
thing)

The code at ca_get_message(), handle_dst_tag(), ca_set_pmt(), etc also
doesn't seem to be using neither one of those fields.

The same happens at firedtv-ci: it also doesn't seem to be using
none of those fields.

It should be noticed that, the dst_ca seems to allow more than one
descrambler:

	p_ca_caps->descr_num = slot_cap[7];

Yet, the index is not used. So, it doesn't seem to be related to
the descrambler index (or there's an implementation bug there - and
at dvblast - as none uses it).

What *I* suspect is that this were meant to be used for either
CA index/type or DESCR index/type, but, when this got implemented,
people discovered that this would be useless and never actually
used those fields. Yet, I may be completely wrong and those were
added to mean something else.

If so, then we could just change the struct to:

	struct ca_msg {
		unsigned int reserved[2];
		unsigned int length;
		unsigned char msg[256];
	};

And document just length and msg.

Thanks,
Mauro
