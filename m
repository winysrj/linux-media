This is a good idea, but it would require to re-draw everything, as we don't
have those files vectorized (I might have one or two svg files on an older
tree, as I had to re-generate some graphics that used to be just pdf).

One of the reasons why SVG was not used in the past is that there used to have a 
target to generate pdf files, and I think that the DocBook tools available on 
that time weren't capable of working with svg. Not sure if xmlto currently
supports it, but, as we've removed the pdf generation for the media API, 
changing them to svg is ok.

Mauro.
