Helo.

Short intro.
After 6 years my old FV3000 boiled its condensers.
I am looking for new card now.
Few hours I spended googling for specs and comparing it with 
http://www.linuxtv.org/wiki/index.php/Supported_Hardware.
There are some informations in kernel/Documentalion/video4linux/CARDLIST*.
Anyway I am not sure - technical details of cards are not easy 
accessible in internet. Most infos sounds like "buy, buy, buy".

Conditions are:
Hybrid analog + DVB-T.
PAL, PAL-BG/DK
Stereo sound.
MPEG-4 hardware decoding.
At least good working analog module (with linux drivers) and DVB-T 
module in progress or, of course, working just now.

In CARDLIST I found Pinnacle Hybrid PCTV.
But there is few cards with that name.
Will Pinnacle Hybrid PCTV 7010ix work good?
There are other cards with multiple signing.

And one question to polish users.
Is there some address, where I can find infos about DVB-T range in Poland.
I know there still are only little areas but I live in Warsaw and here 
are such places.

Regards
