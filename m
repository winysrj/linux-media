I've noticed a lot of chatter lately about the need & want for
standardized signal strength information in linux. This subject has
come up a number of times before and even appeared to have gotten
serious discussion at certain points but to my knowledge has never
been resolved. What is the current state of the issue, and what will
it take to get it done once and for all? Maybe 2013 can be the year of
agreement and this long absent feature can finally be added... Or
should we not hold our breath?
