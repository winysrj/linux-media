Hi Andy,

thanks for this excellent analysis :)

kaffeine-1.0pre3, xawtv-4.0pre (->discontinued), vdr-1.6.0, mythtv-0.22:

None of them uses neither DMX_ADD_PID nor DMX_REMOVE_PID in conjunction
with DMX_OUT_TSDEMUX_TAP.

So reverting the kernel patch does not do harm to anybody.

Furthermore: If it is technically possible to send and receive, demux
and multiplex, play and record complete contents of a transponder (i. e.
multiple TS streams) by using dvbstream or mumudvb (-> 8192 command line
parameter), then I myself do not see the necessity to extend the
capabilities of one physical device dvr0 or demux0 into a multiplicity
of devices dvr0 or demux0.
The what and especially the why will remain Andreas Oberritters' secret.

However: The hanging process that alevt-dvb produces if an external
application switches to a channel belonging to a different DVB-S
transponder still remains the second problem which is not touched by
this discussion - just as a reminder for everybody!

The one who wants to use teletext under Linux is in a very bad position:

1. There seems to be a plugin for vdr that I never tried because I do
not like vdr at all.
2. alevt-dvb is officially not maintained. The last contribution by its
original author happened in 2007 with the implementation of v4l2.
3. mtt by Gerd Knorr (Hoffmann) is part of a discontinued suite called
xawtv-4.0 pre. xawtv-4.0 pre was never officially released or finished.
Especially the main program xawtv is simply unusable for modern DVB
needs.

mtt is still buggy and I do not like its design at all.
On the other hand it's not impressed or handicapped at all by the kernel
patch incriminated above. That's why I said that the problem discussed
here cannot be uniquely defined as kernel-specific.
It's also application-specific. It's simply both.
 
In some distros (Debian f. ex.) mtt does not exist officially.

Who of the people reading this feels competent enough in DVB application
programming to have a look at alevt-dvb to resolve the problem with the
hanging processes please?
Who volunteers please? Manu Abraham perhaps?

Thanks and Regards

CS
