My question was specific:

Support for device ASUS (1043:48cd) lacks in current saa driver;

I managed to make it work by modifying current version, since it's a
clone of ASUS (1043:4876) device;

How could I share this, if this list is the relevant audience of
linux-dvb stuff.

Perhaps this list is NOT the right place to deal with dvb driver
development, I don't know.

Regards.
