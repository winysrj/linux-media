As I said before dma_unmap() isn't the real problem here.

The issues is more that you can't take a lock in the MMU notifier which 
you would also take while allocating memory without GFP_NOIO.

That makes it rather tricky to do any command submission, e.g. you need 
to grab all the pages/memory/resources prehand, then make sure that you 
don't have a MMU notifier running concurrently and do the submission.

If any of the prerequisites isn't fulfilled we need to restart the 
operation.

Yeah, that is exactly what amdgpu is doing now. Sorry if my description 
didn't made that clear.

Certainly a good idea, but I think we might have that separate to HMM.

TTM suffered really from feature overload, e.g. trying to do everything 
in a single subsystem. And it would be rather nice to have coherent 
userptr handling for GPUs as separate feature.
