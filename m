Hi Alexandre,

Thankyou for your bug report,

Could you please be specific here?

Are you referring to linux-media/master branch or such? The latest from Linus' tree?

Please also detail the steps you have taken to reproduce this issue - and of
course - if you have made any code changes to make the latest UVC module compile
against a v4.9 kernel...

Building the latest git tree and installing as a module on a v4.9 kernel is
quite a leap... I wouldn't have expected that to work.

The code would have to be compiled against a v4.9 kernel directly, and I didn't
think compiling the UVC driver against older kernels worked.

(at least it didn't work cleanly when I tried to compile v4.15 against a v4.14
kernel last month)

I believe Guennadi's latest work for handling meta-data (in the latest v4.16-rc1
I think) will create two device nodes.

It would be expected that only the device with video functions as a streaming
camera device, while the other would not.

This part is of particular concern however.

Guennadi - Have you tested Cheese/VLC with your series?

Are there any known issues that need looking at ?
