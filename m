for me it seems all lists are right and even linux-dvb should be added.

We had quite a lot of reports during the last years concerning bttv
throughput on certain hardware and often there was no quick solution.

It is nice to see how many are still aware of the driver's details.

Such a thing even caused the foundation of the v4l wiki, since David
Liontooth was on some affected bttv hardware mix times back and had to
dig into on which hardware best to start for his upcoming teaching.

Unrelated not yet working saa713x NTSC closed captions were fixed in
following attempts too.

But it sheds also a light on the saa713x restrictions, when DVB-T and/or
DVB-S on hybrid cards is in use already and why in such a case analog
video can only use packed formats at once, but no planar.

A user friendly solution still needs to be found and this here seems to
be a good point to start.

Cheers,
Hermann
