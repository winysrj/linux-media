Hi Mauro,

There's one more underlying issue there than potentially having both no-one
with the device and time to test it: the driver does not function as-is in
mainline (nor any recent non-mainline kernel either). Quite some work would
be required to update it (both to figure out why the whole system crashes
when trying to capture images and change the driver use modern APIs). A
small while back we decided to still keep the driver in the tree:

<URL:http://www.spinics.net/lists/linux-media/msg56237.html>

(The rest of the discussion took place in #v4l AFAIR.)

So, what could be done now is either 1) write a patch that changes the
driver to use the right API and take a risk of adding one more bug to the
driver; or 2) remove the driver now and bring it back only if someone really
has time to make it work first.
