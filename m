The reason ttm needed it was because there was another lock that interacted
with the ctx lock in a weird way. The ww lock it was using was inverted with another
lock, so it had to grab that lock first, perform a trylock on the ww lock, and if that failed
unlock the lock, wait for it to be unlocked, then retry the same thing again.
I'm so glad I managed to fix that mess, if you really need ww_mutex_trylock with a ctx,
it's an indication your locking is wrong.

For ww_mutex_trylock with a context to be of any use you would also need to return
0 or a -errno, (-EDEADLK, -EBUSY (already locked by someone else), or -EALREADY).
This would make the trylock very different from other trylocks, and very confusing because
if (ww_mutex_trylock(lock, ctx)) would not do what you would think it would do.

Minimalism isn't bad, it's just knowing when to sto
