Jose, Antti,
The no_probe option or similar is the only fix I could find (in fact i
was going to propose a similar patch to what you have).  I've tried
all combinations of firmware and also tried issuing the read command
to the tuner in different states (e.g. sleep, just after soft/hard
reset) to no avail.  I've modified AverMedia's linux driver to probe
as well, and the same thing happens.  I found the following behavior
in further testing:

- I can arbitrarily read as many bytes as I want from any valid
register and the tuner will continue responding until the af9035
issues the expected NAK to signal the end of the read so that the
mxl5007t can release the bus.  The bus doesn't get released and it
stays stuck either high or low indefinitely so subsequent I2C commands
fail.
- Hard reset of the tuner by cycling af9035 GPIOH12 seems like the
only way to recover.  So mxl5007t is probably at fault.  Perhaps I2C
speed is too fast (SCL cycles at ~100KHz)?  Faulty hardware design of
the usb stick?
- Doesn't seem like the OEM drivers ever issue I2C read commands.
Maybe it's a known issue to them.

I'm pretty much out of ideas to test.  Suggestions are welcome.
Otherwise I'll try to push through a patch for just "no_probe".

Thanks,
Alessandro
