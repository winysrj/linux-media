I would have loved to attend the Media mini-summit. Unfortunately I
already made plans to leave Friday. In addition participating in the
V4L2 Explicit Syncronization discussion, it would have been good to
discuss:

the my pending Media/Audio resource sharing patch series that is
dependent on Sakari's lifetime managemnet patch series.

I have been unable to get any discussion going on this topic on the
mailing list.

thanks,
