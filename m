Hello,
don=E2=80=99t know if this is the right way to report, so excuse me in =
advance if it is wrong=E2=80=A6
While searching the internet to fix my " TT S2-3650-CI USB with HH90 =
Rotor=E2=80=9C problem (see https://forum.libreelec.tv/thread-3038.html)
I found this original patch =
(https://www.spinics.net/lists/linux-media/msg38226.html) from the same =
author as the current lnbp22.c ;
Since it is not yet included and not on the Incoming patches list I =
decided to post to you.
Any chance to get this merged (at least for the lnbp22)?=20
Thanks
Ognian
