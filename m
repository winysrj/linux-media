Yes, thanks, exactly my case. Now I know the idea won't be rejected it
can be polished.

Yes, you seem to be right.

I still think 4% is maybe enough for control traffic.

Ok. By the way, why should we limit it to be not less than 100?
Likewise, a user who knows exactly what he/she is doing could limit
periodic bandwidth to be less than 80% required by USB specification.

Thanks. I'll try to prepare updated patch.
