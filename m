Hi,

1. I've just installed Fedora 12, anticipating that my WebCam will
finally work under linux. It does not. Perhaps it was not included in
the list of WebCams for FC12.

2. Sorry that my qualification does not suffice to use the ov51x JPEG
driver from
http://www.rastageeks.org/ov51x-jpeg/index.php/Main_Page

3. Another option, I downloaded  a window installer for vf0330:
WCVI_0330_PCDrv_US_1_11_01.exe
hoping to run it with "wine" (rund Wionows apps under linux).

Any advice would be greatly appreciated.
All in all Fedora 12 runs smoothly, beyond of my WebCam vf0330.

Thanks.

Leo

PS This WebCam runs all right with Windows PC. So it is not broken.
