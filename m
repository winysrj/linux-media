The two are related, you're of course right about that.

We're not really moving forward here. Part of our disagreement comes in my 
opinion from having different requirements and different views of the problem, 
caused by experiences with different kind of devices. This is much easier to 
solve by sitting around the same table than discussing on mailing lists. I 
would propose a meeting at the ELC but that's still a bit far away and would 
delay progress by more than one month, which is probably not acceptable.

I can reply to the e-mail where I've drawn one use case I have to deal with to 
detail my needs if that can help.

Alternatively the UK isn't that far away and I could jump in a train if you 
can provide tea for the discussion :-)
