for the few devices I do have, you seem to be for sure right.

All the Creatix stuff drawing up to 900mA on a potentially dual isl6405
has direct voltage from the PSU over an extra floppy connector.

Max. 500mA should be sufficient with a DiSEqC 1.2 compliant rotor.
Nothing else should come above that limit.

I wonder, if someone close in reading specs just now, can tell if 900mA
can be sufficient for two rotors ;)

Andre, BTW, assuming you still have a CTX944 (md8800 Quad), can you
measure if the 16be:0008 device really does switch between 13 and 18V.

Mine does not, but is also not in the original PC and the 0007 and 0008
devices are swapped on the PCI bus compared to that one.

Seen from my limited skills, it should not make any difference. So I
don't know why some did report all is fine on 0008 and I can only say it
hangs on 18V after init from the i2c capable 0007 device and on exit it
powers down properly, that's all, but _never_ is on 13V.

Be aware, that RF loopthrough between the two DVB-S tuners is
enabled ...

Thanks,
Hermann
