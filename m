Hi Steven,
I was not aware of the fact that your patch depends on dvb-core as in 
4.2-RC2 (and up, I guess)
I tested against 3.18.18 and 4.1.2. That might explain the failures.
Anyhow, as soon as Antti and you are on the same page regarding this 
patch, I'll test again against a 4.2-RC>1
Regards,
Tycho.
