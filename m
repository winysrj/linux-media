Sure, but I hope we'll all working on fixing the issues in time, as we
can't postpone it forever ;)

I didn't review the request API, but this is added to the V4L2 API, right?

The media controller stuff should be generic enough to be used by other
drivers that don't belong to V4L2 and/or to create a pipeline that
is set to work on multiple subsystems (like V4L2, DVB, ALSA and DRM,
at the same time).

Yes, configuring properties on the links are needed (I'm using a generic
term "properties" here, as V4L2 sub-device formats are specific to V4L2 API).

For sure this requires more discussions.

Well, pads are provided in the order they're created, meaning that
they're ordered (at least while we don't have dynamic pad
addition/removal). Yet, IMHO, instead of relying on it or adding
something transitory at the API, the best is to merge the properties
API ASAP.

Do you have already some testing patchsets with it?

Yes. Btw, there's a proposal of a plugin for v4l-utils to work with
an Exynos hardware. It could help us to better define the needs to
extend it into a generic plugin for applications to use libv4l to
setup pipelines via MC.

I guess you miss-understood me. The libmedia_dev is a library that uses
sysfs to discover all interfaces associated with a certain hardware.

This is, for example, what it shows on an em28xx-based HVR-950 device:

$ ./v4l2-sysfs-path 
Video device: video0
	vbi: vbi0 
	dvb frontend: dvb0.frontend0 
	dvb demux: dvb0.demux0 
	dvb dvr: dvb0.dvr0 
	dvb net: dvb0.net0 
	sound card: hw:2 
	pcm capture: hw:2,0 
	mixer: hw:2 
Alsa playback device(s): hw:0,3 hw:0,7 hw:0,8 hw:1,0 

Currently, the devices are seeing using sysfs nodes, with is not 100%.
Also, depending on the root device, the sysfs graph changes and may not
work fine. The logic is also complex, as it needs to read lots of sysfs
nodes to discover it.

All of the above info could be retrieved using G_TOPOLOGY.

See:
	https://mchehab.fedorapeople.org/mc-next-gen/hvr_950.png

(ALSA nodes are not there, as I didn't add ALSA support yet for
 em28xx).

> do you have the media graph of the em28xx somewhere?

Yes, I'm adding the graphs generated by G_TOPOLOGY ioctl at:

	https://mchehab.fedorapeople.org/mc-next-gen/

Among them, we have several TV devices. The ones with em28xx are:

- HVR950: hybrid analog/digital TV + capture + alsa output + VBI capture
	(ALSA not implemented yet on MC)
	https://mchehab.fedorapeople.org/mc-next-gen/hvr_950.png

- WinTV USB 2: Pure analog TV device + capture, no VBI
	(ALSA not implemented yet on MC)
	https://mchehab.fedorapeople.org/mc-next-gen/wintv_usb2.png

I have more em28xx devices here, but tested only with the two above,
as I need to patch also the saa711x driver (with is a replacement for
the tvp5150 Analog TV decoder) for it to properly report the 3 PADs
on it.

As I said, let's see how well we'll handle the development, and take the
decision of changing it later on.
