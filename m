Imo synchronization should not be part of the dma_buf core, i.e.
userspace needs to ensure that access is synchronized.
begin/end_cpu_access are the coherency brackets (like map/unmap for
device dma). And if userspace asks for a gun and some bullets, the
kernel should just deliver. Even in drm/i915 gem land we don't (and
simply can't) make any promises about concurrent reads/writes/ioctls.

Imo the only reason to add sync objects as explicit things is to make
device-to-device sync more efficient by using hw semaphores and
signalling lines. Or maybe a quick irq handler in the kernel that
kicks of the next device. I don't think we should design these to make
userspace simpler.

Cheers, Daniel
