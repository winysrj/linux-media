OK, so it really is a low-level function only.  How about a comment that
explicitly says this?  "Only called from $FOO with the area already
isolated."  It probably also deserves an __ prefix.

What kind of success have you had running this in practice?  I'd be
worried that some silly task or a sticky dentry would end up in the
range that you want to allocate in.
