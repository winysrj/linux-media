Damien, care to test?
http://git.linuxtv.org/anttip/media_tree.git/shortlog/refs/heads/it9135_tuner

I split tuner out from IT9135 driver and due to that AF9035 driver 
supports IT9135 too (difference between AF9035 and IT9135 is integrated 
RF-tuner). I added iManufacturer based checks for both AF9015 and AF9035 
drivers
