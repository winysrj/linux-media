My name is Barr. Martin William and i am writing to you about the death of
my late client whom I believe to be one of your relatives and some
fund($US9,500,000,00)he left behind before his death. And I want you to
stand as his next of kin since you have the same surname with him and claim
this money before the bank confiscates it.

Contact me for more information (barr.martinwilliam@outlook.com)

Barrister Martin William Esq.
