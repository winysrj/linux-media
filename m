Hi all,

I'm trying to use the dvb-s2 pci-express card "TeVii S472" with the linux kernel.
I haven't found a usable driver until now, but I've seen that the previous cards (S471, S470) are supported by the current linux kernel.
The driver from the manufacturer's site is more than one year old and doesn't compile with current kernels.

I'd be grateful for any information or ideas.

Regards,
Hendrik
