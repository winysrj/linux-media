I agree. Our current approach is a lot more flexible. You can find very
similar feedback in my reply to those review messages. However, I also
understand Daniel's concern as well. I believe we need more dicussion
regarding this matter.

yeah but once you have a DRM object (whether it's dmabuf or not) on a remote
domain, it is totally new object and out of sync (correct me if I am wrong)
with original DRM prime, isn't it? How could these two different but based on
same pages be synchronized?

I checked displif.h. I like the concept of chaining 2nd level grefs.
As you should have already realized, our multi-level addressing is almost
identical to gref directory except that we defined another level on top to
address multiple 2nd level grefs instead of creating a linked list. And I
see there would be an advantage in terms of memory saving in your method. 

Now I think why it should be remaining as one of displif features. I think
we could expand this to any type of large buffer sharing use-case in Xen
(possibly as an extension to grant-table driver?)

Sure thanks. We can talk about it. just FYI, I have prepared a application
note that contains definition of hyper_dmabuf messages included in RFC v2
patch. That would be a great starting point. It will be great if you can
review it.
