Great, thanks for taking a look!

All of the precursor stuff is in mainline now, so it can go via whatever
path.  I'll just go ahead and request a pull in the near future unless
somebody objects.

Interesting...for all of my programming life I've left out spaces around
multiplicative operators - a way of showing that they bind more tightly
than the additive variety.  I thought everybody else did that too.
CodingStyle agrees with you, though; I'll append a patch fixing these up.
Learn something every day...

Thanks,
