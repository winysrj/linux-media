EXTENDED DEADLINE AUGUST 24th:

Due to multiple conflicting deadlines and the fact that many people are
in the middle of an extensive examination period, we received many
requests for a deadline extension.

Therefore, the deadline for regular paper submission to ICAT 2013 has been
extended to August 24th.

  ICAT 2013 Conference: December 11-13, 2013
===========================================================================

ICAT (International Conference on Artificial Reality and Telexistence) is the
oldest established international conference on Virtual Reality (VR) and
Telexistence. Started in 1991, ICAT has annually brought together VR, MR,
and Telerobotics researchers from around the globe. It has been held in
different locations in Asia, Oceania, and Europe. VR and Telexistence have
the potential to augment human ability in perception, understanding, and
action in time and space. The technologies that are the focus of this research
community also make it possible for humans to be seemingly anywhere at any
given time, thus providing humans virtually ubiquitous impact and interaction
possibilities.

ICAT 2013 will not only look for innovations in VR technology itself, but also
explore novel ways to express and transfer information and creative ideas to
societies and their people. ICAT 2013 will include technical sessions covering
traditional VR areas as well as new emerging areas with a lineup of plenary
sessions, invited talks, technical tours, and technology/art exhibitions.

The organizing committee cordially invites you to submit original technical
work and experimental results related to Virtual Reality to this conference.
Each submission will be refereed on the basis of technical quality, novelty,
significance, and clarity.

We invite contributions on a broad range of topics, such as

Artificial Reality / Virtual Reality
Teleoperation / Telepresence / Telexistence
Augmented Reality / Mixed Reality
Motion Tracking
Real Time Computer Simulation
Ubiquitous / Wearable Computing
Visual and Auditory Displays
Anthropomorphic Intelligent Robotics
Software Architectures for VR
Immersive Projection Technologies
Retroreflective Projection Technologies (RPT)
Tools for Modeling VR Systems
Haptics
Multi/Cross-Modal Interfaces
Evaluation of VR Techniques and Systems
Distributed and Collaborative VR Systems
Augmented Humans
Natural User Interfaces
Brain-Machine Interfaces / Brain-Computer Interfaces
Human Robot Interaction
Medical VR/AR


- Information for Authors
ICAT 2013 uses a single-blind review process. Outstanding original paper
submissions, as identified by the review process, will be accepted as oral
presentations or poster presentations.

Authors of accepted papers will be responsible for preparing a final camera-
ready electronic version of their paper. The copyright of the final papers
must be transferred to VRSJ (The Virtual Reality Society of Japan).

Accepted papers will be published in the conference proceedings distributed on
USB flash drives and archived on the ICAT webpage.

The ICAT 2013 is supported by IEEE Technical Co-sponsorship. Accepted papers
will be archived via IEEE Xplore after the conference. ICAT 2013 reserves the
right to exclude a paper from distribution after the conference (e.g., removal
from IEEE Xplore) if the paper is not presented at the conference.
In particular, a paper accepted for the ICAT 2013 technical program will not
be published at IEEE Xplore if its authors do not present the paper at the
conference.


- Submission Instructions
Authors should submit papers through an electronic submission system, which
will be announced at the conference URL: http://www.ic-at.org/2013/

Papers have to be written in English and can be of up to 8 pages in length.
They must be formatted according to the IEEE Computer Society VGTC authoring
guidelines: http://www.cs.sfu.ca/~vis/Tasks/camera.html

Authors can submit one ZIP file as supplemental material, including movies,
images, etc. The maximum total storage size of the paper and the supplemental
material will be announced with the submission instructions.
