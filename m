Devin,

I saw his email and I've been in private communication between him and 
Provideo trying to get the information he needs.  However his request 
was for the PV-947D against the IVTV driver.  These cards are using the 
bttv driver.  I was hoping a bttv maintainer could look at the 
information I posted first to make sure this information wasn't duplicated.

Thanks!
