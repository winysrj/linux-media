You're welcome, but unfortunately you are suffering from a totally different 
problem. I searched around a bit and found some "old" threads from June 08 
with related problems... but no solution. :(

No, actually I did not. :-) All I said is I had a brief look over the mantis 
tree and spotted several known areas which area cicam related. From what I 
had seen, I thought everything was already in place and concluded that you 
might be suffering from a similar problem like I did for several month 
because everything looked very familiar. But it seems like the cicam support 
is rather new and still not quite ready. 

I am sorry I cannot be of more help but I don't have a Mantis based card here 
nor have I any experience with the Mantis tree. :-( Maybe someone else...?

Hope you get this fixed sooner rather than later... :-(

So long,
mathtias.
