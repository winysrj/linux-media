Also, since all graph objects (interfaces, entities, pads) all use the same
base struct (media_graph_obj) it makes sense that we use the same media_link
struct for linking two graph objects.

There is a difference in how connector entities behave (e.g. input pads are
not connected to output pads, instead they represent pins on the connector) and
how connector entities are used (V4L2 drivers might want to enumerate connector
entities to implement VIDIOC_ENUMINPUT).

So giving them their own distinct type makes sense to me.

Note that this usage of 'group' is quite different from what the group ID
was intended for: that was to group entities relating to the same HW device
(e.g. group the sensor and flash together so it is clear which flash entity
belongs to which sensor).

My understanding is that today no in-kernel driver uses the group ID, and I
am very skeptical about the whole concept. I think this can be much better
described using properties.

I have no objection against a MEDIA_ID_T_LINK, but this whole group concept
should be ignored for now and internally we should remove the group ID
completely.

The big problem I see in general with a 'group' concept is that it is
awfully vague. Let's just table this for now and revisit when there is a
clear need for it.

We could reserve the range 1-63 for entities, and if we get more entities,
then it will just use the global ID counter.

Not ideal, but it will make it safe for existing apps.

No problem with that. I wasn't sure whether or not a flags field should be added
since we don't need any flags for entities at the moment.

That's not what I meant. I meant using the mc_ prefix instead of the media_
prefix for internal structs. So media_entity in the public API would map to
mc_entity in the internal API. Ditto for media_interface/mc_interface,
media_pad/mc_pad, etc.

Using graph_ instead of mc_ is something I would be OK with as well.

That's not a problem since the kernel will need to flatten the list of pads
anyway, so adding a counter and filling that in is trivial.

Hmm, OK. Let's try without num_foo and see if that causes any problems. It
can always be added later.

Not really. The reason the entity name is a property is that the name can
be quite long, which is hard to represent in a fixed struct (that's a problem
in the current implementation), whereas it works fine as a property. The
reason the type (i.e. 'sensor', 'flash', 'dma-engine') is a property is
because there can be multiple types (bad name, type, but that's another story)
for a single entity. Again, hard to do in a fixed struct, but it works well
if these are represented as properties.

Definitely a property, not a field.

Please don't call it usage. Calling it 'pad_type' or possibly data_type
will work.

I am a bit worried about this. To my knowledge applications that use the MC
today are expected to know which pad of an entity does what, and it identifies
the pad by index.

The new public API should still provide applications with this information in
one way or another. The pad ID won't work, certainly not in the dynamic case,
the PAD_TYPE as suggested here will only work as long as there is only one
pad per type. Suppose there is an entity with two output pads, both for video?
One might be SDTV, one HDTV. How to tell the difference?

One option might be to have a pad_type or data_type for basic type information
to have generic code that just wants to find VBI/VIDEO/AUDIO streaming pads,
and a name[32] field that is uniquely identifying the pad and that can be used
in userspace applications (or drivers for that matter by adding a find_pad_name()).

You will need a __u32 total_length here so userspace knows how much memory
it should allocate for the objects pointer. You don't want userspace to call
this ioctl three times: once to get the num_objects, then again to get the
lengths of each objects, and a third time to get everything after allocating
memory for each object.

Instead return the total_length and let the kernel fill in the object_data
pointers. These object_data pointers will be awkward for the compat32 code,
but doable.

So objects is sizeof(struct media_graph_object) * num_objects +
sum_of(length of each object).

> 	struct media_graph_object *objects;

You also need a filter field: if I am only interested in interfaces, then
I don't want to get the other object types.

Note that this will also require that properties are graph_objects (I'm
not opposed to that) since it should be possible to return the properties
with the same G_TOPOLOGY call (to keep everything atomic).

This doesn't make sense: struct media_graph_topology would fill in an
array of struct media_graph_object would point to media objects that
in turn contain a struct media_graph_object.

I wouldn't embed a struct media_graph_object in these structs, there
is no point to that. Thinking about this some more you don't need the
length field either, only an id (this gives you the type, so you know
whether the object_data pointer is for a media_entity or a media_pad
or whatever) and the pointer. Strictly speaking you would only need
the 'type' part of the ID, but I see no reason not to fill in the full
ID.

No, you can't. Say you've compiled the application with a header that includes
the foo field, and then you run the same application with an older kernel that
doesn't have the foo field. Any access to foo would give garbage back (or fail).

You really need those reserved fields. The alternative would be to mess around
with different struct versions, and that's painful.

It's an option, but the first 'advantage' doesn't actually work, and I am
not sure about the second. Yes, it is an advantage but it comes at a price:
the void pointer. I very much prefer strict typing.

BTW, my initial proposal had a __u32 reserved[64] field, I'd redo that as
follows:

	struct
		__u32 num_reserved;
		void *ptr_reserved;
	} reserved[32];

This will make 32/64 bit pointer size differences much easier to handle.

And in my opinion, if we end up with so many different object types, then
we have a much bigger problem and another redesign would be required.

In general, I prefer strict typing over void pointers, and having to cast
all the time is something I'd really like to avoid. This API also gives
you filtering for free (just leave the relevant pointers NULL).
