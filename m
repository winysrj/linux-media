True, the question is whether or not you have to send a global IPI to do that.

Indeed.

I agree your patch is better then current state. I just did want to add
yet another global IPI I'll have to chase afterwards.. :-)

If a page is in the PCP list when we check, you'll send the IPI and all is well.

If it isn't when we check and gets added later you could just the same have
situation where we send the IPI, try to do try an empty PCP list and then
the page gets added. So we are not adding a race condition that is not there
already :-)

I plan to send V5 of the IPI noise patch after some testing. It has a new
version of the drain_all_pages, with no allocation in the reclaim path
and no locking. You might want to wait till that one is out to base on it.


Thank you for considering my feedback :-)
