You often just can't decide about clocks hierarchy at SoC level as it
can depend on the board layout and which devices are used on it.

I think everyone agrees on that.

:) When we tried to upstream the code setting up parent clocks in board files
some people disagreed on that too..

Yeah, I don't believe this is best possible solution either..

I hope this can be be properly resolved with the DT. I thought there is not
much work
going on yet wrt supporting clocks hierarchy in DT though.
