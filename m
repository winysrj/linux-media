Hi Folks - is there any interest/hope in developing a driver for the
Conexant 25854/25858? Barriers?

The options for high-performing multiple camera PCIe cards on Linux
are very limited. Cards based on the the 25858 are cheap and available
by the bucketload.

I noticed the 25854/8 mentioned on the LinuxTV wiki. I've seen
references to someone providing a linux driver at
http://tprd.info/lexwiki/index.php/Module:M858_module

I haven't been able to obtain it myself, but it does seem to be possible.

Regards,
John
