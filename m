Hi all,

everyone who has once got his or her patch committed to v4l received an 
auto-reply

From: Patch added by Xxxxx Xxxxx <hg-commit@linuxtv.org>
To: linuxtv-commits@linuxtv.org

with a comment:

<quote>
The patch number NNNN was added via name <user@provider.com>
to http://linuxtv.org/hg/v4l-dvb master development tree.

Kernel patches in this development tree may be modified to be backward
compatible with older kernels. Compatibility modifications will be
removed before inclusion into the mainstream Kernel

If anyone has any objections, please let us know by sending a message to:
	v4l-dvb-maintainer@linuxtv.org
</quote>

What does this mean? Does the last sentence refer to "patches may be 
modified" or to "patch was added"? And why should objections against 
either of them be sent to the maintainer instead of being discussed on the 
list? Don't understand. Does it mean that if a specific author has 
objections, the respective driver can be left off from the 
backwards-compatibility conversions?

Thanks
Guennadi
