The patch introduces two IOCTL to retrieve object detection result.
I think it should be handled by IOCTL. The interface is a little complex,
so it is not easy to handle it by CIDs, IMO.

Certainly, some generic CIDs for object detection will be introduced later and
will be handled in the object detection(the current fdif generic
driver, patch 6/7)
generic driver.

I think object detection is better. For example, face detection is very
different with face recognition, isn't it?
