Hi All,

Thanks again for your assistance with getting my HVR4k running on Hardy 
Heron, I appriciate the assistance I was given, thank you.

A quick question, and this might seem mad considering how many Radio 
channels are available on Satellite, I wondered if anyone had 
sucessfully got the FM tuner running on the HVR4000? I only ask as I 
work on a local station that is only available on FM, not on Digital or 
satellite, and I could do with being able to use the FM tuner on my card 
to dump some shows to disk for review.

I know this is the DVB mailing list, and I'm asking an analogue 
question, but hopefully because the card is DVB you'll let me off!

Thanks in advance,

Ian
