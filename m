I do not have any personal experience with anyone using this support
with latest kernels. I too am okay with removing the broken support.

Since the header file that defines the ioctl is not in include/uapi/*, I
guess it cannot be considered stable userspace ABI? Also, there are
enough warnings about instability thrown in the comments surrounding the
ioctl in include/media/davinci/vpfe_capture.h.
