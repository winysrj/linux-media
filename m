There is no concept of Interrupts/IRQ as such here, Hence no question of using
GENIRQ.

The FM device WL128x is interfaced via the UART,
(Internally inside the WL128x chip the BT-core on the chip
communicates with FM chip via i2C, and would have dedicated interrupt
lines may be...)

So, Whenever we refer to interrupt or IRQ or handlers in the driver,
It pretty much means a receive callback for the UART frame which
constitutes the FM interrupt event.
i.e FM interrupt would have occurred, If I receive a frame over UART
which starts with 0x08 as 1st byte and has 0xFF as its 3rd byte.

I hope this clarifies the non-usage of GENIRQ with threaded support.
