yes, it is in fact modification of CBC mode implemented this hacky way.
These IVs are only for compatibility with loopaes and very old trueCrypt formats.

I think your patch is ok (if it is just plain conversion), if it is
really needed, we can switch to ahash later in follow-up patch.

All common code in dmcrypt uses async API already.

p.s.
there is a lot of lists on cc, but for this patch is missing dm-devel, dmcrypt changes
need to go through Mike's tree (I added dm-devel to cc:)
