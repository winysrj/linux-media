Justin, I think you're on the wrong track here. You seem to be in a
hurry to fix all these warnings generated by gcc 4.6. There is no hurry
at all. Most warnings are false positives, and actual bugs may take
some thinking and knowledge. So rushing is not needed and not
desirable. Going too fast, you might even introduce new bugs, or
prevent old bugs from being properly fixed.

Warnings are a chance to make the code better. The goal is not to fix
them quickly, but to fix them properly. If this is not your intent,
then please stop immediately and let others deal with these warnings.
If you want to help, this is appreciated, but what we need it quality,
not quantity.

Or just LXR online if you don't want to install anything:
