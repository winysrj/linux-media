[Aside: I'm writing this while your replies trickle in, but I think
it's not yet answered already.]

Ok, I've discussed this a lot with Maarten on irc and I think I see a
bit clearer now what's the aim with the new sleep state. Or at least I
have an illusion about it ;-) So let me try to recap my understanding
to check whether we're talking roughly about the same idea.

I think for starters we need to have a slightly more interesting example:

3 threads O, M, Y: O has the oldest ww_age/ticket, Y the youngest, M
is in between.
2 ww_mutexes: A, B

Y has already acquired ww_mutex A, M has already acquired ww_mutex B.

Now O wants to acquire B and M wants to acquire A (let's ignore
detailed ordering for now), resulting in O blocking on M (M holds B
already, but O is older) and M blocking on Y (same for lock B).

Now first question to check my understanding: Your aim with that
special wakeup is to kick M so that it backs off and drops B? That way
O does not need to wait for Y to complete whatever it's currently
doing, unlock A and then in turn M to complete whatever it's doing so
that it can unlock A&B and finally allows O to grab the lock.

Presuming I'm still following we should be able to fix this with the
new sleep state TASK_DEADLOCK and a flag somewhere in the thread info
(let's call it PF_GTFO for simplicity). Then every time a task does a
blocking wait on a ww_mutex it would set this special sleep state and
also check the PF_GTFO bit. If the later is set, it bails out with
-EAGAIN (so that all locks are dropped).

Now if a task wants to take a lock and notices that it's held by a
younger locker it can set that flag and wake the thread up (need to
think about all the races a bit, but we should be able to make this
work). Then it can do the normal blocking mutex slowpath and wait for
the unlock.

Now if O and M race a bit against each another M should either get
woken (if it's already blocked on Y) and back off, or notice that the
thread flag is set before it even tries to grab another mutex (and so
before the block tree can extend further to Y). And the special sleep
state is to make sure we don't cause any other spurious interrupts.
