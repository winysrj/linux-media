IMO, the extra few MBytes are not helpful for the issue at all, considered the
kernel virtual memory address fragmentation problem, you know there is only
several MBytes DMA coherent virtual address space on ARM.

In fact, streaming DMA is more widespread used than coherent DMA in
kernel, so why can't videobuf2 support streaming dma? :-)

You know under some situation, coherent DMA buffer is very slower than
other buffer to be accessed by CPU.

Sorry, could you describe the abuse problem in a bit detail?

I don't think the two helper are required for the VIDEOBUF2_PAGE memops, why
can't driver handle DMA mapping directly?
