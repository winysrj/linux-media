I didn't know there was a more recent version of Deepthy patches,
Since they are not yet in mainline we should decide if we work on top
of that or on top of mainline. Deepthy patches are very good to
separate bt656 and non-bt656 execution inside the ISP, also add a
platform data variable to decide which mode has to be used.

But reading the documentation and from my experimental validation I
think that there are a few things that can be improved.

First the assumption that we can use FLDSTAT to check if a frame is
ODD or EVEN I find to not always be true. Also I don't know who sets
this value since in the TRM always talks as it is only used with
discrete syncs.

Also, I don't think that we should change the ISP CCDC configuration
inside the VD0 interrupt handler. Since the shadowed registers only
can be accessed during a frame processing, or more formally the new
values are taken at the beginning of a frame execution.

By the time we change for example the output address memory for the
next buffer in the VD0 handler, the next frame is already being
processed so that value won't be used for the CCDC until that frame
finish. So It is not behaving as the code expect, since for 3 frames
the CCDC output memory address will be the same.

That is why I move most of the logic to the VD1 interrupt since there
the current frame didn't finish yet and we can configure the CCDC for
the next frame.

But to do that the buffer for the next frame and the releasing of the
last buffer can't happen simultaneously, that is why I decouple these
two actions.

Again, this is my own observations and what I understood from the TRM
and I could be wrong.

Yes, probably is too much of a hack, but I didn't know of another way
that the subdev could report to the ISP of the standard and since
v4l2_pix_format has also a priv field, I think it could be at least a
temporary solution (remember that we want this to work first and then
we plan to do it right for upstream submission).
