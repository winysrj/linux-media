But it's used a lot in the kernel:

~/linux$ git grep default.y\$ | wc -l
1292
~/linux$ git grep default.n\$ | wc -l

This function is not intended to be called directly. It's used by fence_put.

The declarations are put next to the code. The inlines are defined in the headers,
so they get documented there.

No, unless you believe the fence ended up in a state where it is signaled, and now no longer is. ;)
