The machine code should be equivalent in size and speed.

CodingStyle shouldn't specify anything on the matter.  There is no
overall, optimal choice for all contexts.   Arguing either way is as
pointless as the Lilliputians' little-end vs. big-end dispute.

Correct, it does not.  I just checked CodingStyle and checkpatch
yesterday.

It depends on one's measurement criteria for "optimizing" the written
form of source code.

I prefer more explicit statement of action is taking place over
statements with fewer characters.  It usually saves me time when
revisiting code.

More genrally I prefer any coding practice that saves me time when
revisiting code.  (Note the word "me" carries a lot of context with it.)

Ambiguity and implicit behaviors ultimately waste my time.

Me too.

That is another reasonable critereon in "optimizing" the written form of
the source code.  I tend to give it less weight though.
