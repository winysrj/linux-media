The current state of mainline has doubled the kernel stack size with
KASAN, and completely turned off the warning for per-function
stack frames. In some cases, this is completely broken as we have
functions that exceed even the 32kb per-thread stacks by themselves,
so I want to turn on the warning again and fix all the outliers.

The hard part is deciding what size is reasonable for a given function,
as smaller limits cause more harmless warnings while larger limits
can hide more actual problems. Before running into the KASAN
problem, I had already determined that we can lower the warning
limit for 64-bit architectures from 2048 bytes to 1280 with just
a handful of patches that are generally a good cleanup anyway.

This led me to picking three separate warning limits, based on
what I found reasonable to work around in the code:

3072 bytes with -fsanitize-address-use-after-scope
1536 bytes with KASAN but without -fsanitize-address-use-after-scope
1280 bytes on 64-bit without KASAN
1024 bytes on 32-bit architectures

If we use higher limits, the patch series will get a bit shorter. For
the limits above, I needed a total of 51 patches, while this shorter
series of 26 patches has slightly laxer limits:

3072 bytes with -fsanitize-address-use-after-scope
2048 bytes on 64-bit architectures with or without KASAN, but
          without  -fsanitize-address-use-after-scope
1024 bytes on 32-bit architectures

The individual patches should list the highest frame size I ran
into, so I can try to reduce the number of patches if you have
a suggestion for a different set of limits.
