Is this really necessary?  If this is intended to be a
lowest-common-denominator between many drivers to allow buffer sharing,
it seems like it needs to be able to be usable by all drivers.

If the interface is not accessible then I fear many drivers will be
forced to continue to roll their own buffer sharing mechanisms (which is
exactly what we're trying to avoid here, needless to say).
