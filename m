I might still be wrong, but since such stuff did get _very_ personal
sometimes, I still ask why.

Fact is, tell me lies, that potential and good people were running for
NDAs very hard that time and some did know this game already better than
others, who were giving the patch monkeys.

I still do say, that this whole mess we saw, is fully caused by kernel
rules and accepted as collateral damage.

Tell me, who did try to intercept these obviously colliding trains from
somewhere above and backed you to stop it?

Greetings,
Hermann
