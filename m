I thought about it too, and decided for disabling the driver entirely
since I suspected that
not only the per-function stack frame is overly large here but also
depth of the call chain,
which would then lead us to hiding an actual stack overflow.

Note that this driver is almost certainly broken, it hasn't seen any
updates other than
style and compile-warning fixes in 10 years and doesn't support any of
the hardware
introduced since 2002 (the company still makes PCIe ISDN adapters, but
the driver
only supports legacy PCI versions and older buses).
