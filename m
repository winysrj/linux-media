I've tried lower resolution and YUYV with MJPG too, this has the same problem:
cvlc v4l2:///dev/video0:chroma=h264:width=320:height=240
cvlc v4l2:///dev/video0:chroma=yuyv:width=320:height=240

Mine is 2.1.4, my distro is Ubuntu 14.04. I can see libv4l2.so.0.0.0
in maps, but I have no idea what it's used for..

Tried mplayer and cheese now, and it seems they are not affected, so
it's an issue with vlc. I wonder why it doesn't like newer flags..

Ohwell, sorry for the noise.
