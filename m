I think that you should add enum dma_data_direction as an argument
unmap function. It was mentioned that the dma_buf_attachment should keep
cached and mapped sg_table for performance reasons. The field
dma_buf_attachment::priv seams to be a natural place to keep this sg_table.
To map a buffer the exporter calls dma_map_sg. It needs dma direction
as an argument. The problem is that dma_unmap_sg also needs this
argument but dma direction is not available neither in
dma_buf_unmap_attachment nor in unmap callback. Therefore the exporter
is forced to embed returned sg_table into a bigger structure where dma 
direction is remembered. Refer to function vb2_dc_dmabuf_ops_map at
link below as an example:
