It's not clear to me that it ever was resolved for the 1500q.  If the
goal is for it to get fixed, it's usually a matter of getting a sample
unit in the hands of a developer who knows how to debug the issue.  A
common problem is the lack of overlap between people who have the
board versus people who know what to do with it.
