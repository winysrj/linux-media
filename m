Yes, I think so too. Just need a nice way to handle transition, I'd
like in the end to have drivers implement only the improved methods and
map legacy methods in evdev.

No, if you want separate event devices just create a new instance of
input device for every keymap and have driver/irrcv class route events
to proper input device.
