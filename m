Yes, which would either mean we inject a second network adapter into the guest which needs to be configured to an IP address, hence possibly colliding with some other IP range that's in use outside, or reuse some real network connection, which is neither always given, nor always desired. We have a full new PV serial protocol (virtio-serial) just for exactly that reason: To be able to run a daemon inside the guest that does not require IP access to talk to the host.

USB/IP really has its own huge set of issues. Sure, it might be good for certain use cases, but it's definitely not a one-size-fits-all solution. But so far, doing FV emulation right has worked out a lot better for most use cases than inventing PV solutions. Real hardware simply seems to be supported by others, while we can't afford to write drivers for all OSs :). So IMHO, PV should be the last resort, when emulating real hardware utterly fails. In this case, I believe the hardware designers finally got the spec usable for us, so it should be good! :)

Yes, which is an issue that's hopefully gone when we're finally having xHCI actually properly emulated and all the infrastructure for it laid out. We still have UHCI and OHCI emulation today already to fall back to if really necessary, but installing an xHCI driver inside the guest really isn't more work than installing USB/IP inside the guest.
