So I'm understand you correctly, can you clarify that only people who
provide their full name and number of commits have any "credibility"?
As well, I'm under the premise that everyone is entitled to their
opinions and free to express them as they see fit.  And in doing so,
all others may interpret those opinions any way they choose, but no
single opinion is any less or more "valid" then any other.

I'm going to have to disagree with you.  I've seen negative comments
towards Mauro made first-hand in #linuxtv but those same people
unwilling to do so when Mauro has been present.  I'm sure there are
logs that can be searched if anyone is so inclined to see for
themselves.

Everyone here has the right to post their thoughts whether you
(dis)like or (dis)agree with them.  Your opinions are no more valid
and mine as no less valid.  As I've stated before, I have no personal
or financial interest in what happens and that allows me to speak more
freely because I have nothing to lose.  You are welcome to skip over
any of my posts or ignore my thoughts completely, but I'm not going to
shut up because a couple people don't like what I have to say.  That's
not how this works, sorry.

Cheers,
