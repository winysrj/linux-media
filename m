Hello Laurent,

Le Mon, 26 Sep 2011 21:02:48 +0200,
Laurent Pinchart <laurent.pinchart@ideasonboard.com> a Ã©crit :

So far, we have used VLC, Cheese, or a simple OpenCV based application
to test the V4L2 device on our ARM platform, and I have no idea which
capture method those are using. Is there a very simple V4L test
application that we could use to hack the buffer unmap/remap trick
you're suggesting as a test ?

Regards,

Thomas
