Since with cma you can assign a region exclusively to a driver you can ensure
that this problem does not occur. Of course, if you allow sharing then you will
end up with the same type of problem unless you know that there is only one
driver at a time that will use that memory.

There is obviously a trade-off. I was just wondering how costly it is.
E.g. would it be a noticeable delay making 64 MB memory available in this
way on a, say, 600 MHz ARM.

In the case of the ivtv driver the PCI device had a broken scatter-gather DMA
engine, which is the underlying reason for these issues. Since I was maintainer
of this driver for a few years I would love to have a reliable solution for the
memory issues. It's not a big deal, 99.99% of all users will never notice
anything, but still... And I don't think there are any affordable or easily
obtainable alternatives to this hardware with similar feature sets, even after
all these years.

Anyway, I agree with your sentiment, but reality can be disappointingly
different :-( And especially with regards to video hardware the creativity of
the hardware designers is boundless -- to the dismay of us linux-media developers.
