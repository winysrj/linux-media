That one is not for me

will handle these, some are fixes for 3.6, others for 3.7

These patches are among those, that I pushed for 3.6 and that have been 
lost.

3.7 or even 3.8

I didn't necessarily consider this one for me? I could help review it id 
you like, but so far I'm happy with others taking care of it;-)

A duplicate of the first patch in this list.

IIRC, a fix for 3.6-rc.
