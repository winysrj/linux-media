Those were not added yet, as no driver currently uses it.

Same here.

There are 3 parameters for Satellite and Cable systems:
	- Roll off factor;
	- Symbol Rate;
	- Bandwidth.

Only two of the tree are independent, as the spec defines:
	Bandwidth = symbol rate * (1  + roll off).

For DVB-C Annex A and C, roll off is fixed (0.15 and 0.13, respectively).

ITU-T J 83 Annex B doesn't say anything about it, but the ANSI SCTE07 spec
says that the roll-off is approx. 0.18 for 256-QAM and approx. 0.12 for
256-QAM.

DVB-S also has a fixed roll-off of 0.35, while DVB-S2 allows configuring it.

Not 100% sure, but ISDB-S also seems to use a per-modulation roll-off factor.

Anyway, when the roll-off is known, only symbol rate is needed, in order
to know the needed bandwidth.

IMHO, we should add some function inside the DVB core to calculate the
bandwidth for DVB-C (and DVB-C2), as the tuner saw filters require it,
in order to filter spurious frequencies from adjacent channels. Some
demods may also need such info.

The DVBv5 API doesn't impose any step for the carrier value, as it is
specified in Hz. So, I don't think that any change would be needed at 
the userspace API, in order to support DVB-C2 "continuous" carrier spacing.

Same here: currently, no driver implements it.

Implementing those parameters is not a matter of just adding new stuff at
the core. Developers need DVB-C2 capable hardware, and access to a broadcaster
using it (or access to some testing facility where DVB-C2 could be
simulated).
