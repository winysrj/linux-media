Good point. The for loops applying the register values (the lines just
after those changed by my patch) defuse the regmap bulk write capability.

I guess this could be improved not filling any table, but directly
calling regmap_bulk_write(), passing the u16 or u32 register value with
proper endianness. No tables, less code. This would replace the present
patch with a shorter and more effective one. Is it what you was suggesting?

I'll try that.
