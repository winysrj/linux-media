Hi Laurent,

Thank you for the patchset.

At most 80 characters per line would be nice.

How does the user discover what data_offsets are possible if the driver
returns an error if the data_offset does not match hardware capabilities?

I'd rather have the driver to adjust data_offset to match what it can do. If
the user needs to know that the data_offset was not modified, it should
check the field value after QBUF/PREPARE_BUF.
