Thank you for this suggestion.

The way I have done it is to put the new I2C address in the DT and the driver
programs the change using the original I2C address. The original I2C address
is hardcoded in the driver. So maybe we can extend the DT binding and the I2C
framework so that both addresses come from the DT and avoid hiding the
original I2C address in the driver. This sounds good to me.

Then changing the address could be device specific and also this must be done
right after power on so that there are no address conflicts. So I don't think
that we can support this through the I2C framework only, the drivers that we
want to do that will have to be expanded with this functionality. Or do you
have any other idea?

Best regards,
Todor
