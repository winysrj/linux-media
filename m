I'm in 100% agreement with you both on synchronization being a
separate problem.  The android team is working on a generic solution
for that as well, expect to see some of it coming across this list in
the next few weeks.  I do hate the idea that an implementer might
abuse this api for that purpose.

I want to make sure I understand how this would work.  I've been
planning on making cache maintenance implicit, and most of the
corresponding userspace components I've seen for android expect to do
implicit cache maintenance on these buffers if they need cached
mappings.  The android framework has a logical place for this
maintenance to take place.  I assume that you'd detect a buffer
leaving the cpu domain by using the dma_data_direction passed to
dma_buf_map_attachment?  We're definitely pushing a bunch of
complexity into the exporter, that at least on android could easily be
covered by an explicit api.  I'm not dead set against it, I just want
to make sure I get it right if we go down this road.
