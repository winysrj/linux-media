Subject: [PATCH v7 3/10] Documentation: devicetree: Update Samsung FIMC DT
 binding

This patch documents following updates of the Exynos4 SoC camera subsystem
devicetree binding:

 - addition of #clock-cells and clock-output-names properties to 'camera'
   node - these are now needed so the image sensor sub-devices can reference
   clocks provided by the camera host interface,
 - dropped a note about required clock-frequency properties at the
   image sensor nodes; the sensor devices can now control their clock
   explicitly through the clk API and there is no need to require this
   property in the camera host interface binding.

Resending only single patch which changed.

Changes since v6:
 - #clock-cells, clock-output-names documented as mandatory properties;
 - renamed "cam_mclk_{a,b}" to "cam_{a,b}_clkout in the example dts,
   this now matches changes in exynos4.dtsi further in the patch series;
 - marked "samsung,camclk-out" property as deprecated.

Changes since v5:
 - none.

Changes since v4:
 - dropped a requirement of specific order of values in clocks/
   clock-names properties (Mark) and reference to clock-names in
   clock-output-names property description (Mark).
