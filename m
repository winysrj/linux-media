Hi,

let me ask you some details of your interesting idea (how to
achieve the same functionality as with vtunerc driver):

Please stop learning me what can be called driver and what nope.
Your definition is nonsense and I don't want to follow you on it.

Can you show me, how then can be reused most important part
of dvb-core subsystem like tuning and demuxing? Or do you want me
to invent wheels and to recode everything in the library? Of course
I can be wrong, I'm no big kernel hacker. So please show me the
way for it. BTW, even if you can find the way, then data copying
from userspace to the kernel and back is also necessery. I really
don't see any advantage of you solution.
