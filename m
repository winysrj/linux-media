First I'd like to say thanks to the maintainers of the various HVR 
drivers, the amount of work that goes in is much appreciated.

I notice from www.kernellabs.com that progress on the digital side for 
SAA7164 devices is going well and a stable driver is nearly ready.

I, like many people, would really like to have analogue support for 
these devices, is there any news on when this functionality might be 
available?

Thanks in advance.

Lou
