i have installed dishes before and the usual mechanism is to stick a 
little portable meter onto the lnb and try to align the dish.
for the final finetune, i usually connect to a receiver with some sort 
of signal strength meter and have that relayed to me as i perch up on 
top of a ladder.

all in all rather unsatisfactory.

i was wondering if anyone on this list knows of any tools to help set it up?
i had in mind an app using linux-dvb and a usb dvb-s (or dvb-t for that 
matter) receiver which would provide information about:

signal strength
noise level
even some indictation of sat being pointed to by trying to tune to an 
expected transponder and decoding the information

of course you could extend it from there to include coverage maps and 
setup information (angles etc.)

it would need a very "chunky" interface so that you could see it from 
the top of a ladder while the laptop is on the ground.

any thoughts?
