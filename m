Mauro, we've already had that discussion last time. In order to
intercept ioctls of a device, the device needs to exist to begin with,
right? That's where vtuner comes in: It creates the virtual device.

For that reason your suggested approach using LD_PRELOAD won't work.

Besides that, suggesting LD_PRELOAD for something other than a hack
can't be taken seriously.

I think you didn't even understand what vtuner does, after all the
discussion that took place.

It's not a driver for supported hardware either. You named it before:
It's not a driver in your definition at all. It's a way to remotely
access digital TV tuners over a network.

Wrong. You failed to convince people why this must be implemented in
userspace. Even Michael Krufky, who's "only" against merging it, likes
the idea, because it's useful.

Just because something can be implemented in userspace doesn't mean that
it's technically superior.

What's left is your unreasonable GPL blah blah. So the answer to Honza's
question is: Yes, Mauro is nacking the driver because he's worrying
about possible misuse.
