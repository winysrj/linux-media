(I'm jumping into the discussion in the middle, and might miss something
that has already been talked about. I still hope what I'm about to say is
relevant. :-))

In subsystems such as V4L2 where drivers deal with such large buffers, the
buffers stay mapped all the time. The user explicitly gives the control of
the buffers to the driver and eventually gets them back. This is already
part of those APIs, whether they're using dma_buf or not. The user could
have, and often has, the same buffers mapped elsewhere.

When it comes to passing these buffers between different hardware devices,
either V4L2 or not, the user might not want to perform extra cache flush
when the buffer memory itself is not being touched by the CPU in the process
at all. I'd consider it impossible for the driver to know how the user space
intends to user the buffer.

Flushing the cache is quite expensive: typically it's the best to flush the
whole data cache when one needs to flush buffers. The V4L2 DQBUF and QBUF
IOCTLs already have flags to suggest special cache handling for buffers.

Kind regards,
