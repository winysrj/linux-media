I've not looked at the patches closely (or read the references paper fully yet),
but at first glance it seems on ARC architecture, we can can potentially
use/leverage this mechanism to implement the shared TLB entries. Before anyone
shouts these are not same as the IA64/x86 protection keys which allow TLB entries
with different protection bits across processes etc. These TLB entries are
actually *shared* by processes.

Conceptually there's shared address spaces, independent of processes. e.g. ldso
code is shared address space #1, libc (code) #2 .... System can support a limited
number of shared addr spaces (say 64, enough for typical embedded sys).

While Normal TLB entries are tagged with ASID (Addr space ID) to keep them unique
across processes, Shared TLB entries are tagged with Shared address space ID.

A process MMU context consists of ASID (a single number) and a SASID bitmap (to
allow "subscription" to multiple Shared spaces. The subscriptions are set up bu
userspace ld.so which knows about the libs process wants to map.

The restriction ofcourse is that the spaces are mapped at *same* vaddr is all
participating processes. I know this goes against whole security, address space
randomization - but it gives much better real time performance. Why does each
process need to take a MMU exception for libc code...

So long story short - it seems there can be multiple uses of this infrastructure !
