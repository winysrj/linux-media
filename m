Yes, you can assume the target node is an endpoint, but you cannot
assume anything beyond that. It is not a good idea to go looking for
more endpoint links in the local hierarchy that terminates the link.

I think depending on a generic graph walk is where I have the biggest
concern about the design. I don't think it is a good idea for the master
device to try a generic walk over the graph looking for other devices
that might be components because it cannot know whether or not further
links are relevant, or even if other endpoint nodes in the target
hierarchy actually conform to the graph binding in the same way.

Consider the example of a system with two video controllers (one
embedded and one discrete), a display mux, and a panel. The display
controller depends on the mux, and the mux depends on the panel. It
would be entirely reasonable to start up the display subsystem with the
embedded controller without the discrete adapter being available, but
the way the current graph pattern is proposed there is no dependency
information between the devices.

I really do think the dependency direction needs to be explicit so that
a driver knows whether or not a given link is relevant for it to start,
and there must be driver know that knows how to interpret the target
node. A device that is a master needs to know which links are
dependencies, and which are not.

I'm not even talking about the bi-directional link issue. This issue
remains regardless of whether or not bidirectional links are used.

I would solve it in one of the following two ways:

1) Make masters only look at one level of dependency. Make the component
driver responsible for checking /its/ dependencies. If its dependencies
aren't yet met, then don't register the component as ready. We could
probably make the drivers/base/component code allow components to pull
in additional components as required. This approach shouldn't even
require a change to the binding and eliminates any need for walking the
full graph.

2) Give the master node an explicit list of all devices it depends on. I
don't like this solution as much, but it does the job.
