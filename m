sorry, just reading the mail backlash on a first attempt.

But what comes into mind from what we really have seen, there are i2c
devices (tuners) with multiple addresses present on the bus, in fact
only one of them "works".

This was improved by new separate silicon radio tuner chips within the
even same range of possible four addresses. That for the radio tuner
address field was introduced.

The same goes for 0x86 and 0x4b demodulator stuff and the like.

Of course it is known that there is an address clash between tda988x and
tda 8290 and as well with that pic in tvaudio.

So, in general I'm with Hans and all here, it is better to have this
device specific in the card's entry.

But Trent is also right in so far, that we don't have it for sure for
all the devices around previously probed, no final list so far.

What gives me more concerns is, that such addresses shared by multiple
devices are on the other driver encoded in the eeprom, even manufacturer
specific (!), and we are more confronted with the mess not to be able to
identify the _type_ of the device then with identifying its address.

This is most visible for digital demodulators currently.

Good night,
Hermann
