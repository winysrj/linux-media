I notice in the original bug report that you claim that the lower framerate
clip with 2.6.34 has "much better quality", could you define this a bit better.

I think that what is happening is the code for the new (correct) sensor is
setting a higher exposure value (and thus a lighter / less dark image), but
setting a higher exposure value comes at the cost of framerate. As the framerate
can never be higher then 1 / exposure_time_for_1_frame.

2 things:

1) Go the preferences in cheese, and see which resolutions you can select, and
    make sure you are using the same resolution in 2.6.34 and 2.6.33

2) Start a v4l2 control panel applet, like v4l2ucp or gtk-v4l, and try playing
    around with the controls (note the controls inside cheese are software not
    hardware controls so don't use those).

Regards,

Hans
