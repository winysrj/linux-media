True. However, unfortunate exceptions are found in the set of sq905 
cameras and sq905c cameras, which have only Interface 0 (and, of course, 
use only Bulk Transport for all data regardless of its nature).

That is almost certain to occur. I am not sure if the cause is natural 
law, or original sin. But it is bound to happen.

I did not follow closely what they did about the issue; I am only aware 
that they confronted it.

Except, I should have said "two or more," it seems.

So, as I understand, these are all about to take place in Vancouver, 
sometime in the next two weeks? It really is the wrong time, but I really 
wish now that I were going. I would at the very minimum try to get the 
people together that I know of, who have wrestled with the issue.
