Blacklisting it won't (or shouldn't work).

>From rc-main, the registering sequence is:

	dev_set_name(&dev->dev, "rc%ld", dev->devno);
	dev_set_drvdata(&dev->dev, dev);
	rc = device_add(&dev->dev);
	if (rc)
		return rc;

	rc = ir_setkeytable(dev, rc_map);
	if (rc)
		goto out_dev;

	dev->input_dev->dev.parent = &dev->dev;
	memcpy(&dev->input_dev->id, &dev->input_id, sizeof(dev->input_id));
	dev->input_dev->phys = dev->input_phys;
	dev->input_dev->name = dev->input_name;
	rc = input_register_device(dev->input_dev);
	if (rc)
		goto out_table;

rc-main will wait for input_register_device() to finish, so even if you
blacklist it, rc-core will load it, in order to solve the symbol dependency.

Btw, there's really a race issue there: device_add is happening before
input_register_device(), so the udev rule will cause troubles.

The fix is probably simpler: we need to change the udev rules to work at
evdev registration and only if the device is a remote controller. This
should solve the current issue.

The format is, currently compatible. However, we'll likely need to change it
(or to allow the tool to handle also a different format), due to some reasons:
	1) Protocol and the device name where it is found by default is
	   currently a comment;
	2) We'll need to add a field there specifying the number of the bits
	   to be used by the keymap table, in order to use the proper length
	   with _V2 ioctls;
	3) There are hundreds of keymaps already created for lircd. It
	   would be nice to support lircd format, in order to make life
	   easier for those that use lirc.

If you want to add these to the generic tool, that's fine for me, but, IMO, this
doesn't sound a good idea. There are already specialized tools for other kinds
of input devices (mouse: gpm; joystick: jstest; etc). It seems a bad idea
to merge them into the generic tools.

I think it is better to have a tool that just handle one kind of device, but
does it well, than trying to extend a generic tool to cover all possible
devices, and adding lots of caveats there for it to handle all the specifics.

It may be broken into a few utilities, by creating a library with the
common code. I'll think about that when I have some spare time for it.
