Pure crap! Because, as I stated already, you are too lazy to read the
context.

Proofs:

1. http://www.spinics.net/lists/linux-media/msg15182.html

This guy was compeletely ignored, although he announced a kernel bug /
security risk. Neither is he banned somewhere, nor are there other ifs
or whatevers to justify just ignoring him.
Also the utmost insane Torvalds-scapegoat-theory dowes not work here at
all. This guy reported a problem, and noone except me listened: Period!

2. http://www.spinics.net/lists/linux-media/msg15356.html

This one the bums here could not ignore at all, because the noise around
was already so loud that ignoring was no longer possible.


MOST IMPORTANT: NONE of them had my overworked version.
And I do not know to which one they were referring to.
There is one at:

1. http://pluto.blackbone-ev.de/v1/AleVT%20mit%20DVB-T.html

and there is one at:


2. http://packages.debian.org/sid/alevt


BOTH are DVB compatible. So with both YOU CAN identify the kernel
security risk / the oops.

So as long as you do not know the facts, better shut up and stay quiet,
stupid!

There's no need to comment your spit-licking that follows.
Everyone knows who you moron are by evaluating your stupid rant, the sum
of self-invented lies.
