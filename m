I would like to SINCERELY urge you to cut the ad hominems. If you feel
you have arguments furthering your position, please let them stand for
themselves. No need to involve someones nationality, religion, star-sign
or whatever to make your point.

I think people on this list have more pressing issues to deal with (like
bisecting hard-to-find kernel oopses or digging up datasheets on
undocumented mixer/PLLs and the like) than listening to rants about
Brazilians not being team players.

Please, just the facts, ma'am. Trolls can feed elsewhere.

Sincerely,

Alain
