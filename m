Still keep feeling an itch to response to this. I am not interested in
any proprietary driver binaries and I tried to work with you and
contributed documentation, testing and lot of time to your em28xx
project. I feel mislead and wasted my time trying to help you. Please
don't response to this mail in this thread make a separate public thread
if you want to discus it. I don't like thread highjacking. You are more
then welcome to contribute code back in small patches for one change at
a time that meets the Linux kernel licensing and coding guidelines. I
sometimes got the feeling you are doing more good then harm working for
Empiatech.

Best regards,
