Following this standard, all satellite tuners share the same cable and each of them has a fixed intermediate frequency it is supposed to tune to. Zapping is done by sending a special DiSEqC message while SEC voltage is temporarily pulled from 14 to 18 volts. This message includes the tuner's ID from 0 to 7, the frequency, band and polarisation to tune to as well as one out of two satellite positions.

I think the kernel implementation would be superior for two reasons:
- There are some timing requirements regarding the 14/18V transitions and the DiSEqC message which could perform better directly from the frontend code,

- In many TV recording applications there is no support for SCR and it would be harder to implement in these. For VDR, there is a patch which is difficult to configure and has some technical limitations. In MythTV and XMBC I could not find any support for SCR. Their Wiki pages or forums say, that there are no plans for Unicable support as it would take huge changes.

Sure, you have to configure Unicable LNBs as you have to configure for example Universal LNBs. So the viewer software has to be aware of your DVB setup's parameters. If you want to have a configuration menu in the viewer software, this software only needs to send a simple ioctl message to the frontend to configure Unicable. If you want to use Unicable with viewers that do not support it, you only have to set your parameters at boot time using dvb-scr-setup.c.

That way, they are also a bit more protected against unintentional changes. In a Unicable system, all participants have interferences if there is one participant using bad settings. So if you start a DVB viewer which is badly or not yet configured, all other participants are disturbed. If you configure your Unicable system using e.g. an init-script, it is impossible to disturb anyone by starting some "Non-Unicable" software.

This can be compared to the setup of serial ports, I think. As far as I know, there is a setup utility to have the parameters set (probably at boot time), afterwards you start the actual application.

Thomas
