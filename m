Hi,

To get analog tv working on a hauppauge hvr-930c, I started sniffing usb and
parsing.

you can see a sample here : https://dl.dropbox.com/u/93775123/grphCable22.txt

Howeverver I am missing a lot of knowledge to jump on it right away, so I'd
as for opinion of the experts over here first.

This could be benifical for several other cards with the avf4910 as well.

thx,

Jan De Graeve
