Subject: [RFCv2 0/2] dma-parms, constraints and helpers for dma-buf
Date: Wed, 21 Jan 2015 09:46:45 +0530

Hello Everyone,

Based on review comments received, I've split my earlier patchset on
'dma-buf constraints-enabled allocation' [1] into 2 sets:
- first one is this one, to use dma_parms and related parameters from
   struct device to share constraints, and then to use these constraints in
   dma-buf to help find the least common constraint set that could then be
   used by exporters to decide on allocation.

   This is a partial re-write of what Rob Clark proposed some while ago [2];
   I've tried to take care of review comments on his patchset, but any errors
   and omissions are, ofcourse, mine.

- Second part, one which I'm working on, and will post soon, aims at adding
   allocator-helpers in dma-buf framework which could use this constraint
   information to help choose the right allocator from a list.

While I work on the second part, I thought of sending the RFC for this one,
to get feedback on whether this mechanism seems ok to everyone.
