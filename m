Hi,

Ok, so the real problem is that there is circular dependency between
<linux/sched.h> and <linux/wait.h>

true, but the real problem is the circular dependency between those
files.

I have to disagree. The fundamental problem is the circular dependency
between those two files:

sched.h uses wait_queue_head_t defined in wait.h
wait.h uses TASK_* defined in sched.h

So, IMO the real fix would be clear out the circular dependency. Maybe
introducing <linux/task.h> to define those TASK_* symbols and include
that on sched.h and wait.h

Just dig a quick and dirty to try it out and works like a charm
