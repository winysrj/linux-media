Is there a DVB-S2 card on the market yet with these features:

     1) DVB-S2 (QPSK, 8PSK) and DVB-S modes fully supported in Linux
         (i.e. not experimental, not requiring sifting through  
different driver sources
         to try to find one that works)

     2) Has no software/hardware data rate limitations (i.e. all  
symbol rates supported, no problems locking
         any symbol rate the card supports)

     3) Available to U.S. purchasers (no country restrictions when  
trying to buy the card)

     4) Delivers a full transport stream without filtering of any kind  
by the hardware.
