There are a second i2c read, but less important.It is in:

tda827xa_set_params

............
        buf[0] = 0xa0;
        buf[1] = 0x40;
        msg.len = 2;
        rc = tuner_transfer(fe, &msg, 1);
        if (rc < 0)
                goto err;

        msleep(11);
        msg.flags = I2C_M_RD;
        rc = tuner_transfer(fe, &msg, 1);
        if (rc < 0)
                goto err;
        msg.flags = 0;

        buf[1] >>= 4;
............
I supposed that buf[0] is the register to read and they read the value in 
buf[1]. The code now seem to work ok but perhaps is wrong.
