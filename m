Isn't the proposed CMA thing vulnerable to the exact same problem? If
you allow sharing of regions and plug some allocator in there you get
the same problem. If you can solve it there, you can solve it for any
kind of reservation scheme.

Well, that's a trade-off, if you want to have the memory be usable for
anything else (which I understood people did want) then you have to pay
for cleaning it up when you need to use it.

As for the cost of compaction vs regular page-out of random page-cache
memory, compaction is actually cheaper, since it doesn't need to write
out dirty data, and page-out driven writeback sucks due to the
non-linear nature of it.

Make sure you reserve pageblocks in the desired range.

I would sincerely hope PCI(e) devices come with an IOMMU (and all memory
lines wired up), really, any hardware that doesn't isn't worth the
silicon its engraved in. Just don't buy it.
