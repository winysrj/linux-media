If we decide to move away from /dev/ion we can consider it.

I don't think it will be completely replaced. A heap can have multiple
capabilities so I suspect there will need to be some cap -> allocation
instance translation. Of course all this is wild speculation since
much of the unix memory allocator isn't well defined yet.
