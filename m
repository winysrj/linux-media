Hi Philipp,

I've got lots of comments and quesitons below, but I must say thank you
for doing this. It is a helpful description.

Bear with me, I'm going to comment on each point. I'm not criticizing,
but I do want to understand the HW design. In particular I want to
understand why the linkage is treated as bidirectional instead of one
device being the master.

In this specific example, what would be managing the transfer? Is there
an overarching driver that assembles the pieces, or would you expect
individual drivers to find each other?

Similar question here, how is the above complex assembled into a logical
device? Is there an overarching controller device for this component
complex?

In all of the above examples I see a unidirectional data flow. There are
producer ports and consumer ports. Is there any (reasonable) possibility
of peer ports that are bidirectional?

This has come up in the past. That approach comes down to premature
optimization at the expense of making the data structure more prone to
inconsistency. I consider it to be a bad pattern.

Backlinks are good for things like dynamically linked lists that need to
be fast and the software fully manages the links. For a data structure like
the FDT it is better to have the data in one place, and one place only.
Besides, computers are *good* at parsing data structures. :-)

I appreciate that existing drivers may be using the backlinks, but I
strongly recommend not doing it for new users.

A whole tree parse isn't expensive. We do it all the time.

Besides, nothing useful can be done until a driver has taken
responsibility for each side of the connection. I would expect to need a
registry anyway for pairing things up. If one side gets connected
without having the backlink, then it should get registered and wait
until another port gets registered that does have the linkage. In which
case a whole tree parse isn't ever necessary.

I think the common code would be even more useful if it implemented a
port registry helper in addition to the parsing. That would make the
decoding transparent.

I don't think that makes it a better data structure.

Nah, I disagree. The binding document /should/ forbid it to make it
really clear what the common pattern is. The code doesn't have to
enforce it (you don't want to break existing platforms), but the
document should be blunt.

Another thought. In terms of the pattern, I would add a recommendation
that there should be a way to identify ports of a particular type. ie.
If I were using the pattern to implement an patch bay of DSP filters,
where each input and output, then each target node should have a unique
identifier property analogous to "interrupt-controller" or
"gpio-controller". In this fictitious example I would probably choose
"audiostream-input-port" and "audiostream-output-port" as empty
properties in the port nodes. (I'm not suggesting a change to the
existing binding, but making a recommendation to new users).
