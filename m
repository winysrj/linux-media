Subject: [Q]: Tevii S480 higher DVB-S2 symbol rate

     Hi all,
a quick question about the tevii S480: I need to tune to a transponder 
which does DVB-S2 45MS/s (QPSK). I have a dying TBS 6921 which was able 
to sustain this rate flawlessly, but the spec of the S480 seems to 
indicate that it should do it also, but I'd like to know if someone has 
actually tested it already.
Moreover if someone could comment on reliability.
TIA
Manu
