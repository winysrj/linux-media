The second best.  The best that we have got is that the user runs a fixed
kernel.

Anyway; if this is the only purpose that this interface version¹ serves,
then Mauro's subsystem-centralized solution has the benefit that it
eliminates mistakes due to oversight by individual driver authors.
Especially because the kind of implementation behavior changes that are
tracked by this type of version datum are sometimes just discovered or
documented in hindsight.  On the other hand, Mauro's solution is redundant
to the uname(2) syscall.

¹) Yes, it is still an ABI version, nothing less.  With all its backwards
and forwards compatibility ramifications.
