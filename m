Oh, and there's no "make uninstall" option in the Makefile, either.
Where does it put those tentacles, so that I can delete them again ?

Well, all I know is that it does NOT segfault without the patch,
and now it does.  At this point I should refer you back to Linus's
posts earlier in this thread for the definition of "breaks userspace".

Could be.  I really don't know.
Again, I could not care less about ir-keyboard,
as I don't use it here at all.

But also again, this thread isn't about what I need fixed,
but rather about broken userspace from 2.6.36 onward.
And the patch to "fix" it seems to possibly cause more breakage.

Cheers
