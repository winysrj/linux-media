I came down to  Russia  for a short vacation. Unfortunately, i was mugged at the park of the hotel where i stayed. All cash, credit cards and mobile phones were stolen from me but luckily i still have my passport with me. I've been to the Embassy and the Police here but they're not helping issues at all the bad news is my flight will be leaving in less than 8-hrs from now but i am having problems settling the hotel bills and the hotel manager won't let me leave until i settle the bills. I'll need your help (LOAN) financially of $2,530 USD. I promise to make the refund once i get back home. Please let me know how you can help and I need you to keep me posted via email.
