Don't shoot the messenger.

I'm just reporting what I had to do to fix a clumsy hack by someone 6
months ago who didn't test their changes.  This patch _restores_ the
operation of a subsystem broken by those changes

Perhaps those responsible for commit
2997137be8eba5bf9c07a24d5fda1f4225f9ca7d:

    Signed-off-by: David HÃ¤rdeman <david@hardeman.nu>
    Acked-by: Jarod Wilson <jarod@redhat.com>
    Signed-off-by: Mauro Carvalho Chehab <mchehab@redhat.com>

should fix the keytable.  In the meantime (next year) I'll be using this
patch.
