That is same for GPIO - it offers standard interface between modules for 
GPIO "bus".

I used it to control LNA, which is connected to demodulator (cxd2820r) 
GPIO. It is bridge which gets LNA API commands and GPIO is property of 
demod. Some interface is needed in order to deliver data between bridge 
and demod in that case.

Do you need eyeglasses? I said it is debug interface. It needs root 
privileges in order to setup and use.

I can say I could surely break more devices via I2C debug interface than 
GPIO debug interface in case both are implemented by every driver. Just 
sent garbage writes to well known eeprom addresses and kaboom. Your 
device is bricked. It is totally stupid to say you could brick your 
device using debug functionality - yes you can, but it is very unlikely 
someone does it as a mistake.

Maybe better to read Kernel GPIO documentation. There is few points 
mentioned why to use it and what are advantages.
