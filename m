Thanks for offering your thoughts on this matter.  It looks like I'll
have to keep checking eBay for cheap USB v3 (HD) webcams periodically.
 For the record, I've only got Motion set to capture four frames per
second at the moment.

I prefer the idea of captured motion to that of timed snapshots.  The
captured images and videos are automatically uploaded to my Dropbox
account.  As I'm only a 'free' user, I must limit the storage space
that these files consume.
