Steve,

Do you know if Hauppauge are willing/able to dish out the
hardware/programming specifications for these cards?

I understand that you're busy with other things, but it seems that
there are a lot of people waiting on support for these cards, and by
the sound of it there are at least a few who have enough experience
and/or time to have a good run at getting something going..

I don't want to sound ungrateful, as I (and many others) appreciate
the amount of time and effort that you put into these things but I
also appreciate that there's only so much time in the day that you can
spend on driver development, and I think that you should at least
acknowledge people who are willing and able to help (eg. Davin),
rather than just coming back with 'no progress'...

If there are problems organising things like NDA's etc or if Hauppauge
don't want to share information then that's fine - I guess we'll just
have to wait...  but if there is any way of letting someone else have
a go, then all I would ask is that you please consider letting them
take some of the burden off your shoulders.

Regards,
Dave.
