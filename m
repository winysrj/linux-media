[cc'ing gregkh because we're talking about modifying struct platform_device]

I'll back you up on this one.  It is a far better solution than the
alternatives.  At least with mfd, it covers a large set of devices.  I
think there is a strong argument for doing this.  Or alternatively,
the particular interesting fields from mfd_cell could be added to
platform_device.  What information do child devices need access to?
