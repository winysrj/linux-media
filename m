i got T328 device from geniatech , chipset: AfaTech and module number:
af9016. also, i got ubuntu 9.10 and the device output from lsusb is:
Bus 002 Device 004: ID 15a4:9016 

anyway, i was installed it correctly and i was trying to locking down
channels with the kaffeine program.

i got something like 40 % signal ( i was add an link to the picture ):
http://i37.tinypic.com/5c0gv9.png so it seems the device is working
great, but no channel locking. (cant catch them and watch them)

some of the people in $v4l channel advice me send this email. tnx for
your helping
