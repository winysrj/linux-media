You can purchase USB cables up to 80 ft long with no degradation in picture 
quality.  I personally have ordered a 36ft cable and tested the product listed 
on this website today http://www.usbgear.com/USB-Extenders.html .

After looking at the quality image produced by that Logitech camera I was almost tempted to throw my hand held digital video camera in the trash.  That said, due to the excellent image quality,  I wanted to design a DVR security solution around the Logitech Quickcam Pro (for the laptop ) cameras.  Is there an IP camera or an analog camera which rivals the  Logitech Quickcam Pro webcam (for the laptop) in terms of image quality that I can purchase for under $100.00US?
