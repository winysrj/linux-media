Well, my argument is that it should be more generic if it were
intended to be put in lib.  It'd be fine to put into drivers/media,
but this code snippet must be a separate module.  Otherwise usb-audio
would grab the whole media stuff even if not needed at all.

It was a code in lib, so it cannot be a module at all :)
