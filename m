Alan Cox raised a bunch of good points.  I'm not going to respond to 
them; they pretty much speak for themselves.

It's not a locking mechanism.  More like cooperative multi-access.

You're wrong, because what I proposed isn't a lock.  If the user 
program dies, the usbfs device file will automatically be closed and 
then usbfs will freely give control back to the webcam driver.

If the program hangs at the wrong time, then the webcam driver won't be 
able to regain control.  At least the user will have the option of 
killing the program when this happens; a similar hang in a kernel 
driver tends to be much uglier.

Two different user programs trying to drive the device at the same time 
doesn't necessarily have to cause a problem.  At any particular moment, 
only one of them would be in control of the device.

No ugly hack is needed.  usbfs can directly inform the webcam driver 
whether or not the device file was closed while the user program 
retained control.  If that didn't happen, it's safe to assume that the 
program gave up control voluntarily.

No, because there is no lock.  Programs that haven't been changed will 
continue to behave as they do today -- they will unbind the webcam 
driver and assume full control of the device.
