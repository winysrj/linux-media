No, you happened to be a complete idiot inspite of doing sane things,
being repeatedly warned with posts on the Mailing List. If you can't read,
you suffer from it. s2-liplianin was created with some cause for promoting
the hardware what you were trying to promote. So definitely it is that way.
I can't help that you ran arbitrary code on your computer  and got screwed.

half baked one's are the usual problematic one's. There used to be one crying
loud over documentation patches.

First of all i had completely no clue on it. That's why i was able to
write a driver for it.
(with sarcasm)
Mate you have no clue. The S2-1600 is based on a reference design and hence.
You have a lot to understand. I don't give it a damn which way to take
it to heart.
