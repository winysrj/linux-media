It's all good, however we need to ensure interoperability with existing
drivers. I mean it shouldn't be difficult to setup data processing
pipelines containing  various types of devices, like video capture,
resizers, filters, etc. The situation where each type of device makes up
their own interface is rather far from ideal.

I think we need a new user interface for that, the closest match would be
the Video Output Interface [1], IMHO this could be used as a base. I got
a bit confused by the additional working memory requirement and thought
the FDIF needs input and output memory buffers to process single image
frame. But that's not the case so there is no reason to bother with
the mem-to-mem interface.

Unfortunately there is no example of virtual output device driver in v4l2
yet. There is only one for the capture devices - drivers/media/video/vivi.c

For video output one uses V4L2_BUF_TYPE_VIDEO_OUTPUT buffer type instead of
V4L2_BUF_TYPE_VIDEO_CAPTURE and at the kernel side .vidioc_*_out operations
of struct v4l2_ioctl_ops should be implemented, rather than .vidioc_*_cap.

It's up to the applications in what way the image data is loaded into
memory buffer, if it comes from a file or from other device. Once it is in
standard v4l2 buffer object it can be shared between v4l2 drivers,
still user space needs to queue/de-queue buffers. See QBUF/DQBUF ioctls
[4] for more information.

That's normally handled by each v4l2 device, see [2] for details at the
user side, and vidioc_s_fmt_vid_cap() in vivi for example.

I suppose VIDIOC_STREAMON/VIDIOC_STREAMOFF would do the job, see [3] and
start/stop_streaming functions in vivi.

Perhaps we need new ioctl(s) for that. And possibly some new controls,
or even new control class [5], [6].

It would also be good to get requirements for other hardware implementations
existing out there. I might be able to look at the Samsung ones eventually,
but cannot guarantee this.
