In the early days, there was a MUX to switch the displays between the
two GPUs, but most modern systems are MUX-less and the dGPU is either
connected to no displays or in some cases the local panel is attached
to the integrated GPU and the external displays are connected to the
dGPU.

In the MUX-less case, the dGPU can be used to render, and then the
result is copied to the integrated GPU for display.
