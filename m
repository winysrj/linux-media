A host OS could chose to virtualize the whole xHCI controller if it
wanted to.  That's part of the reason why xHCI does all the bandwidth
checking in hardware, not in software.

It could be done that way too.  But that doesn't help if you're trying
to run Windows under Linux, right?  Only if all the guest OSes use the
same USB IP protocol then it would work.

I private ack by email would be great.  Or you can ack by facebook:
https://www.facebook.com/event.php?eid=229532200405657  I could add the
event in upcoming.yahoo.com if anyone uses that.
