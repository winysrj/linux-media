Hi all,
I am looking for a DVB-S/S2 card able to reliably tune to high symbol 
rates DVB-S2 (here I have a transponder with 45MS/s), I also need this 
with CI support. I have seen that mystix cards could be a good candidate 
but I am not sure. PCI or PCIe is OK, dual tuner is not mandatory.
TIA,
Bye
Manu
