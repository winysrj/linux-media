This should be an issue with `mplayer' -- the aspect ratio is
simply part of the datastream sent as an MPEG transport stream
as encoded by the broadcaster.

`mplayer' is known to have this issue with the option `-vc mpeg12'
while in recent mplayer, the default is `-vc ffmpeg12' where this
aspect ratio switching works properly.  Try adding that latter
option and see if it works as expected.
