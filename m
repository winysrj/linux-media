__process_new_adapter() calls i2c_do_add_adapter() which always returns
0. Why should I check the return value of bus_for_each_drv() when I
know it will always be 0 by construction?

Also note that the same function is also called through
bus_for_each_dev() somewhere else in i2c-core, and there is no warning
there because bus_for_each_dev() is not marked __must_check. How
consistent is this? If bus_for_each_dev() is OK without __must_check,
then I can't see why bus_for_each_drv() wouldn't be.

Which will never trigger.

Which is adding a lot of lines, and might eventually fail when the
compiler becomes smarter (if it isn't already). Thanks but no thanks.
If I really have to chose one of these evils, I'll go for BUG_ON(), at
least the intent is clear and the bloat is minimum.
