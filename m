We just found that you need image editing.

We are an image studio, we do all kinds of image editing such as for
e-commerce photos, jewelry images
and portrait mages.

Our service includes cutting out and clipping path etc , we also do
retouching.

You may send us a photo, testing will be provided to check our quality

Thanks,
Tony Glenn
