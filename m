I never found any public datasheet for this device.

Well, if you don't add an i2c_gate_ctrl() callback, the mb86a20s won't
be calling it. So, IMO, the cleanest approach would simply to do:

	fe->dvb.frontend->ops.i2c_gate_ctrl = NULL;

after tuner attach, if the tuner or the bridge driver implements an i2c gate.
I don't think xc5000 does. The mb86a20s also has its own i2c gate and gpio
ports that might be used to control an external gate, but support for it is
currently not implemented, as no known device uses it.

So, all you need is to attach both mb86a20s and xc5000 on it, and set the
proper GPIO's.

It will call fe->ops.tuner_ops.set_params(fe) inside the set_frontend() fops
logic, in order to tune the device, but this is the same thing as
zl10353_set_parameters does.

Maybe a remote controller? Do you have a high-resolution picture of the
board?
