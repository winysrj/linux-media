As long as they're relying on the -I flags provided by the build tree, that
oughtn't to be a problem.  If they're doing their own -I flags, they'll need
to add -I include/uapi too (_after_ -I include).

Do you want me to do anything?  I should be able to incorporate a patch prior
to the disintegration of linux/dvb/ if you have one.
