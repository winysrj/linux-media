How difficult is it for me to do this?  And is it obvious when it works? I have an old pc that I can put the card in that doesn't matter. And given I can't get the card to work in windows or Linux its not much use to me as it is, so if it breaks then so be it. 

I've not done any Linux driver development, but I'm happy enough compiling stuff for the most part.

I tried contacting the seller via eBay, but no response so far, so I'm guessing he's not interested, which is a shame.
