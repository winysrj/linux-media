I will look at it, we might still post a fb->mcde_hw first though, since 
it's so little work.

DSS does not have a static dependency on display drivers. DSS is just a 
"convenience library" for handling the correct display driver call 
sequences, instead of each user (fbdev/KMS/V4L2) having to duplicate 
this code.

They are the same module, just split into two files.

I see this as a side effect of DRM putting a dependency between 3D HW 
and KMS HW driver. In most embedded systems, these two are no more 
coupled than any other HW block on the SoC. So by "fixing" this 
_possible_ flaw. I see no reason why a KMS driver can't stand on it's 
own. There's no reason not to support display in the kernel just because 
there's no 3D HW driver, right?

Sure, but that is currently up to board init code. Just as for frame 
buffers, mcde_fb_create(display, ...), we will have a 
"createV4L2device(display, ...)".
