I'd rather have the real time clock everywhere, than a driver-dependent

clock, if it comes to that.

Nevertheless, I agree that the monotonic clock is better than the real

time clock.

In user space, VLC, Gstreamer already switched to monotonic a while ago as

far as I know.



And I guess there is no way to detect this, other than detect ridiculously

large gap between the timestamp and the current clock value?
