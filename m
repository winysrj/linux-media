Not sure if you didn't get this email already, I had a slip-up while
sending it. :) Anyway, there's also another supported card with a CI. A
friend of mine has it, so I guess it works quite well with Linux. It's
Mystique SaTiX-S2 (AFAIK, similar to KNC1+). Mystiques have rather
quality finish and the CI module is ready for 3.5" drive installation.
Some pictures from google:

Others might be able to tell you more details, I just know it works -
friend has a Cryptoworks CAM in it. Take a look around, bye.
