The user base is too small to get any feedback without getting the
patches into mainline.  I suggest you submit the parts you'd like to use
yourself.  That's the only way to get them tested.

I do have two mantis cards, but I don't have any CAM and I don't have
access to any DVB-C signal anymore. So that's why I didn't provide any
feedback despite being historically interested in this driver.
