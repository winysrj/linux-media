Hello Ondrej,

Bad news, the images are compressed by an unknown algorithm (unknown
from Linux point of vue). The decompression function could be found in
some part of the ms-win driver, but:
- first, I have no time to search and disassemble this function,
- then, I did have this problem with an other webcam (17a1:0118), and
  after searching for a long time, nobody could find the function, and
  the driver is in stand-by since 2 years,
- eventually, is this legal?

All I can do is to code the driver and let you or anyone find the
decompression function...

Best regards.
