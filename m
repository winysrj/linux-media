Assuming your board have only 128MB of physical memory (quite common case
for some embedded boards), leaving 16MB unused just for DMA coherent
area is a huge waste imho.

Yes, we know. We plan to recover some of that 'wasted' memory by providing
a way to allocate some kind of virtual swap device on it. This is just an
idea, no related works has been started yet.

Right, we did not cover such case. In CMA approach we tried to separate
memory allocation from the memory mapping into user/kernel space. Mapping
a buffer is much more complicated process that cannot be handled in a
generic way, so we decided to leave this for the device drivers. Usually
video processing devices also don't need in-kernel mapping for such
buffers at all.
