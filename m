Hello everybody.

First of all - this post is not meant as the flame starter, nor is it
"I DEMAND" kind of post - I just would like to know what is the policy
with driver patches.

I bought Medion CTX1921 USB DVB-T stick, since I saw patches for kernel 2.6.32:

http://article.gmane.org/gmane.linux.drivers.video-input-infrastructure/19938/match=1921

so,I thought everything above that, will support this card "out of the
box", however I tried it on kernel 2.6.38 and it still required manual
patching, after minor driver modification it works OK.

So... the question is, why isn't this tuner supported yet, even though
patches were aviable nearly a year ago (and where minor)? What is the
policy here? When can we expect support?

Thanks in advance for the answers.

Best Regards

P.S

Sorry for my English ;]
