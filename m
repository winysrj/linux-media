That seems best to me too. I'm available at both proposed time slots,
and I would like to join both discussions.

I would really like to see the dual mode camera and TV tuner discussion
separated. They are 2 different issues AFAIK.

1) Dual mode cameras:

In the case of the dual mode camera we have 1 single device (both at
the hardware level and at the logical block level), which can do 2 things,
but not at the same time. It can stream live video data from a sensor,
or it can retrieve earlier taken pictures from some picture memory.

Unfortunately even though these 2 functions live in a single logical block,
historically we've developed 2 drivers for them. This leads to fighting
over device ownership (surprise surprise), and to me the solution is
very clear, 1 logical block == 1 driver.

2) Tv tuners:

Here we have a bunch of logical blocks, each with their own driver
(and not 2 drivers for one block), which together form not 1 but 2
video pipelines, typically one pipeline for analog TV, and one
for DVB. The problem here is some blocks are shared between the
2 pipelines.

The solution here, at least to me, is clear too, we need some way
of claiming/locking the pipeline blocks. If pipe1 starts streaming
video data it locks all the blocks it uses. If some app then tries
to use pipe2 (and thus for example tune the tuner to a different
frequency), it will fail with -EBUSY when pipe2 tries to take the
tuner lock and gets told it is in use.

Regards,

Hans
