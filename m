Hi,
I'm not sure about the fix (it could break the driver for other em28xx 
cards) but I will try to post a patch for the em28xx problem on ARM

Next, I have encountered the same USB problem you described : USB 
stopping after a long capture (and ethernet stops too)
For this problem, I think a patch is available about the PHY update 
frequency
Have a look to :
http://rcn-ee.homeip.net:81/testing/beagleboard/sprz319-erratum-2.1/
I found it in a thread on the google beagleboard list)
I will try and post the results here

Regards,
Chris
