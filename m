Looks like I better get another device... :-( So which analog support
bridge did you complete? Any recommended device models?

All I need is a USB hybrid analog PAL/DVB-T TV with FM tuner. (I'm in Australia)

If you change your mind about dib0700, I can assure you that there are
hundreds if not thousands Linux users out there searching for it, from
what I've seen on forums.

It would also help if wiki dib0700 page contained a big "ANALOG NOT
SUPPORTED" note... A wiki page with known working and recommended
devices, sorted by functionality/interface, would be even better...

Thank you for all the knowledge and time invested in this important project!

Cheers,
