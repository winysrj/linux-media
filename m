That's fine.  You just need to ensure that there are no virtual aliases.
One way to do so is to increase the page size to 16kB.

Note that there is a variant of the 24K which has a VIPT cache but uses
hardware to resolve cache aliases.  That is, from a kernel cache management
perspective it behaves like a PIPT cache.

However as I understand what you're mapping to userspace is actually
device memory, right?  You probably want to map that uncached.  That's a
long standing issue in these two macros:

/*
 * Convert a physical pointer to a virtual kernel pointer for /dev/mem
 * access
 */
#define xlate_dev_mem_ptr(p)    __va(p)

/*
 * Convert a virtual cached pointer to an uncached pointer
 */
#define xlate_dev_kmem_ptr(p)   p

which are defined in arch/mips/include/asm/io.h.  These should return
a KSEG1 (uncached XKPHYS) address for anything but RAM.

Would that explain your observations?
