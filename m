Hi Arnd,

Thanks for your review!

I guess I need to clear it up in the documentation - when I said "once
all ongoing access is completed" - I meant to say "once all current
users have finished accessing and have unmapped this buffer". So I
agree with Rob - the migration would only be possible for "attached
but unmapped" buffers. I will update the documentation.

Sure.

Agreed.

:) oversight. Will correct.

Ok, that makes sense.

yes - a stupid one! will correct.

I will take yours and Daniel's suggestion, and remove these; if at all
they're needed, we can add them back again later, with
/s/device/attachment as suggested by Daniel.

Ok. Though if we keep the interface compile-time disabled, the users
can actually check and fail or fall-back gracefully when the API is
not available; If I remove it, anyways the users would need to do the
same compile time check whether API is available or not, right?
