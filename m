I asked on IRC about the KWorld ATSC 120 tuner and was told it isn't
supported currently however it could be made to work.  I was also informed
that all the pre-requisites are finally there, and all that is needed is
glue code.

Could anybody offer advice on obtaining or developing this "glue code"?  I
have minimal experience in unix programming but am always willing to learn
new things.

Thank you.
