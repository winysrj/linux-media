Hi,
I opened a bug report some times ago and this bug
(https://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=15087) has been fixed in
the hg version of v4l-dvb but it seems that this fix is not yet
arrived in a kernel release, am I right?
This bug is still here in 2.6.33.4 (but only sporadically).
Thank you in advance for the answer.
