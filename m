you can do this to, but I just keep v4l-dvb as working directory.

As said already, the tda9887 module is factored out of the tuner again.
The only thing you can do wrong is to select "Customize analog tuner
support" and then disable tuner simple and the tda9886 or the microtune
mt20xx.

Else try "modinfo tda9887" again and set the port options for it, qss=1
is default since some years.

The patches are in v4l-dvb master and 2.6.25.

Since some modules change from kernel to kernel, except tuner related
like tda9887 and tea5767 also video-buf and saa7134-oss come in mind,
it is like you would change from the recent to a very old snapshot and
also the other way round.

In such a case "make rmmod" and "make rminstall" are only fully safe
from the version of v4l-dvb you have installed from.
Since v4l-dvb master is currently in good sync with 2.6.25, a
"ls -R /lib/modules/2.6.25-rc5/kernel/drivers/media |grep .ko"
will find no remaining modules after "rmmod" and "rminstall".

On older kernels you might take a little care to get everything unloaded
with "modprobe -vr" and eventually have to remove some remaining old
modules manually before you run "make install" the first time, but that
is all.

After that it is easy for example to replace the recent v4l-dvb with the
original kernel modules again. Just "make rmmod" and "make rminstall"
from v4l-dvb and "make modules_install" from the vanilla source will do
the job. You have to take care to change the port options again for now,
sorry for that.

For the situation on that card.
The PAL and NTSC versions of the card have the same PCI subsystem and we
can't make a difference. The NTSC version only has sound with qss=0
intercarrier demodulation. Lucas Endress kindly did some testing and the
port options seem not to matter for NTSC-M, but Torsten at DScaler seems
to have reports that port1=0 improves NTSC-M. Also on PAL-I TOP
adjust=0x0e seems to do something.
Maybe we can set port1=0 and port2=0 in the card's entry without side
effects, at least we don't have to care for special radio mode settings
like on the Philips tuners, but we don't have it per tuner and tv norm,
like we would like to have for the users.

Also the analog demodulation of these cards is more card than tuner
specific, the discretes like tda9885/6/7 and SAW filters are not in a
defined tuner area or even tuner housing, this opens ways for other
unexpected manufacturer specific specials. Some power off with port2=0,
others have the ports involved in digital versus analog usage switching.

That's about where it stands.

Cheers,
Hermann
