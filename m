Nothing, it is just a number.

No, not really.

I am not planning on breaking backward compatibility.

It depends. We do not have a clear way to see if new ioctls are
supported (and I do not consider "try new ioctl and see if data sticks"
being a good way) so that facilitated protocol version rev-up. So keymap
manipulating tools might be forced to check protocol version. For the
rest I think doing EVIOCGVERSION just to check that ioctl is supported
is an OK way to validate that we are dealing with an event device, but
that's it.

BTW, maybe we should move lsinput and input-kbd into linuxconsole
package, together with evtest, fftest, etc?
