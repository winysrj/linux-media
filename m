Please use snd_pcm_stream_lock_irqsave() so that I can avoid sending
out similar patch later, :-)

OK, thanks for dealing with that.

It is a cleanup since the patchset only addresses lock problem which
is caused by the tasklet conversion.

Interrupt is't enabled until all current drivers are cleaned up, so it is really
safe, please see patch [2].

We discussed the problem in the below link previously[1], Steven
and Thomas suggested to use threaded irq handler, but which
may degrade USB mass storage performance, so we have to
take tasklet now until we rewrite transport part of USB mass storage
driver.

Also the conversion[2] has avoided the tasklet spin lock problem
already.
