There are several style problems with this function.
1) Bogus comment doesn't add any information.
2) Multi-line indents get curly parens, for stlye reasons even
   though it's not needed for semantic reasons.
3) Preserve the return codes from lower levels.
4) Don't return -1.  -1 means -EPERM and this is not a permision
   issue.
5) Put spaces around math operators.  These were correct in the
   original code.

This function should look like:

static int write_reg(struct i2c_client *client, u8 reg, u8 value, int channel)
{
	int ret;
	int i;

	for (i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
		ret = i2c_smbus_write_byte_data(client,	reg | (channel << 6),
						value);
		if (ret)
			return ret;
	}
	return 0;
}

Now that the function is readable, why are we writing to the
register 10 times?

Bogus comment adds nothing.

The comma was in the correct place in the original code...  This
change is wrong.

The style was correct in the original code.  This change is wrong.

This seems like a very spammy printk().  :/  Put a space after the
KERN_INFO.

The input was better here, where it was declared originally.

These kinds of unrelated changes don't belong in a new feature
patch.  Cleanups, fixes, and features don't mix.  In this situation,
I would just leave it as is.  I know checkpatch.pl complains, but
it's up to the maintainer to decide what to do.  If you decide to
change it (in a separate patch) the format would be:

			printk(KERN_ERR
			       "wis-tw2804: channel %d is not between 0 and 3!\n",
			       *input);

When people submit big patches there is a lot to complain about and
they don't get merged.  I'm a hundred lines into the review and I
haven't even got to any changes which matter or are improvements.
