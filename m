Please look at from analog device point of view which is interfaced to ISP.

OMAP3 ISP => TVP5146 (video decoder)

As a user I would want to expect the standard to be supported on streaming device node, since all standard streaming applications (for analog devices/interfaces) does this.

Setting up the links and format is still something got added with MC framework, and I would consider it as a separate plug-in along with existing applications.

Why do I need to write/use two different streaming application one for MC compatible device and another for non-MC?

I don't agree with you here, I think we made it clear when we started with MC development activity, we will not break existing standard applications. Media-controller will play a roll to setup the links, connecting the pads and stuff.
