Hi Alan,

can't we have the list defaults back, like it was previously?

Means, everyone is just replying to the list and all other is a private
decision, out of what ever reason.

This would avoid at least, that mails with totally unacceptable content
can reach one privately only, because they are filtered on the list.

You don't even have the chance to show, that something really strange
did hit you, since you can not even quote it, because for good reasons
it never makes it through the list's filters.

Cheers,
Hermann
