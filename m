Hi Chris,

You would be well served to break this into a patch series, as it
tends to be difficult to review a whole series of changes in a single
patch.

You seem to be mixed in a bunch of "useless" changes alongside
functional changes.  For example, if you're trying to add in a missing
goto inside an exception block, doing that at the same time as
renaming instances of "errCode" to "retval" just creates confusion.

And finally, the mutex structure used for the modules is somewhat
complicated due to to the need to keep the analog side of the board
locked while initializing the digital side.  This code was added
specifically to prevent race conditions that were seen during
initialization as things like udev and dbus attempted to connect to
the newly created V4L device while the em28xx-dvb module was still
coming up.

In other words, I don't doubt there are bugs, and I cannot say whether
your fixes are appropriate without giving a hard look at the logic.
But you should be aware of the thinking behind the way it was done and
it would be very worthwhile if you could test with at least one hybrid
product to ensure the changes you are making don't break anything (the
em2874 used in the 290e is a poor test case since it doesn't have
analog support).

> BTW, was there a reason why the em28xx-dvb module doesn't use dvb-usb?

This is largely a product of the history of the devices using the
framework.  The em28xx driver was originally analog only, and DVB
support was added later as new chips came out which needed it.  The
dvb-usb driver came from dedicated DVB devices that had no analog
support.  In fact, even today the lack of analog support is a huge
deficiency in that framework which is why we don't support the analog
side of any hybrid devices that use dvb-usb.

In other words, if we were reinventing this stuff today, there would
probably be only a single framework shared by dvb-usb and em28xx.  But
at this point it's too much cost and too little benefit to go through
the work to attempt to merge them.

Devin
