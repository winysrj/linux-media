I don't think the current implementation is wrong, it's just different
from other drivers; there's really no requirement regarding this AFAIU.
It's one of the things where no attention has been paid I presume.

However doing anything that can fail earlier on would be nicer since
there's no reasonable way to signal an error from complete callback either.
