Resending once again to remove an unused empty struct in second patch.
I have kept the received tags because the change is rather trivial.

Changes since version 8:
- removed unused empty struct ov5645_subdev_internal_ops;
- removed two redundant new lines above and under ov5645_remove().

Changes since version 7:
- "unsigned int i" changed to "int i" in ov5645_find_nearest_mode();
- unused varialbe removed from ov5645_entity_init_cfg().

Changes since version 6 include:
- keep a pointer to the current sensor mode and remove enum ov5645_mode;
- do not keep v4l2 control values and xclk frequency in the main data struct;
- add caching variables in then main data struct for some of the register values
  to avoid i2c read commands;
- use reference counting for power state;
- enable xclk only after regulators are enabled;
- add check for xclk rate that it is supported;
- register v4l2 subdev only at the end of probe when the rest is succeeded;
- add hardware pin names in gpio descriptions in the dt binding document;
- other minor changes: uppercase to lowercase, add const modifier, remove
  unnecessary local variables, fix return values.

Changes since version 5 include:
- external clock frequency set in DT;
- added v4l2_subdev_pad_ops.init_cfg function to initialize formats;
- current sensor mode not updated if set_fmt is TRY (not ACTIVE);
- other small changes - debug messages removed, register addresses defines
  renamed, redundant safety checks removed, unnecessary labels removed,
  mutex_destroy added.

Two one-line changes since version 4:
- return current format on set_format;
- return all frame sizes when enumerating them.

Only one change since version 3:
- build failure on kernel v4.7-rc1 fixed:
  s/media_entity_init/media_entity_pads_init/

Changes from version 2 include:
- external camera clock configuration is moved from DT to driver;
- pwdn-gpios renamed to enable-gpios;
- switched polarity of reset-gpios to the more intuitive active low;
- added Kconfig dependency to OF;
- return values checks;
- regulators and gpios are now required (not optional);
- regulators names renamed;
- power counter variable changed to a bool power state;
- ov5645_registered() is removed and sensor id reading moved to probe().

Changes from version 1 include:
- patch split to dt binding doc patch and driver patch;
- changes in power on/off logic - s_power is now not called on
  open/close;
- using assigned-clock-rates in dt for setting camera external
  clock rate;
- correct api for gpio handling;
- return values checks;
- style fixes.
