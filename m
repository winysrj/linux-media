Just let this driver depend on VIDEO_V4L2_SUBDEV_API: most of the i2c drivers
depend on it already.

I think that the CONFIG_MEDIA_CONTROLLER and CONFIG_VIDEO_V4L2_SUBDEV_API will
disappear in the not too distant future and are always enabled. Certainly
CONFIG_VIDEO_V4L2_SUBDEV_API doesn't serve much of a purpose anymore IMHO.
