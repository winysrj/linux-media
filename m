OK, maybe it is safer then. I have no any hybrid hardware to test...

Anyhow, I wonder how many years it will take to resolve that V4L2/DVB 
API hybrid usage p≈ïoblem. I ran thinking that recently when looked how 
to implement DVB SDR for V4L2 API... I could guess problem will not 
disappear near future even analog TV disappears, because there is surely 
coming new nasty features which spreads over both V4L2 and DVB APIs.
