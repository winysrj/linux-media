It's sort of indirectly related, anyway, I utterly hope that the
generic IC drivers will be ready and accepted for v4.21, see 
https://lwn.net/ml/devicetree/20181008211205.2900-1-vz@mleia.com/

Adding more ICs and cell devices to the framework is appreciated, 
in the queue there are DS90UB913, DS90Ux929, DS90Ux947, DS90UB964.

Steve, in case if you're unaware, that's FYI also.
