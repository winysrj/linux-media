I don't like that patch at all. My opinion is that you should put hacks 
like to the interface driver. Override demod .read_signal_strength() 
callback and route it to the tuner callback. No any changes for the 
demod driver should be done.

Estimation of the signal strength is a little bit hard when looking 
demod point of view. Demod gets IF as input signal and thus have mainly 
idea of IF AGC values. Estimating RF strength is thus very inaccurate 
from the IF AGC gain. And those IF AGC values are tuner/demod 
combination dependent too. Sometimes there is also RF AGC available for 
the demod. With both IF and RF AGC you could estimate more better - but 
still very inaccurate.
