The versions are increased at the discretion of the driver maintainer,
usually when there is some userland visible change in driver behavior.
 I assure you the application developers don't *want* to rely on such
a mechanism, but there have definitely been cases in the past where
there was no easy way to detect the behavior of the driver from
userland.

It lets application developers work around things like violations of
the V4L2 standard which get fixed in newer revisions of the driver.
It provides them the ability to put a hack in their code that says "if
(version < X) then this driver feature is broken and I shouldn't use
it."

It's the best (and really only solution) we have today.

The driver maintainer doesn't *have* to increase the version - he does
it when he thinks it's appropriate.  The point is you are taking that
discretion out of *their* hands, and you yourself are unaware of when
it is actually needed.

You need to stop looking at this from a purist standpoint and think of
how application developers actually use the API.  They need tools like
this to allow them to work around driver bugs while having a source
codebase which operates against different kernels (including kernels
that may still have those bugs).

Sure, in a perfect world where drivers don't have bugs and
applications don't have to run against older kernels, what you are
saying is not illogical.  But then again, we don't live in a perfect
world.
