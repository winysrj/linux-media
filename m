It's of course hard to get an overall view of all users, but the more I look 
at the problem the more it seems like both out-of-tree kernel drivers (in 
particular a Marvell CSI-2 receiver driver) and userspace (in particular 
gstreamer) have implemented support for the data_offset field as proposed in 
this patch series. We could of course argue that this is incorrect, and that 
there are out-of-tree drivers and userspace code that use data_offset for the 
purpose it was initially envisioned for (I'm thinking about Cisco code 
possibly, at least the one you've had the opportunity to review :-)). However, 
if the majority of users use data_offset "incorrectly", maybe we should 
consider that usage as being the de-facto standard and consider this series as 
a documentation fix.

The question is thus, what does the majority of the users do ?

I certainly second that :-) Sakari, do you have something in mind ?
