I'm not kernel developer and probably my opinion would be a little
naive, but here it is.


Please, make the kernel load firmware from the filesystem on its own.


This should solve almost 99.9% of the problems related to firmware loading.

I don't mind if there is still userland component that could be used
to request a firmware from repository. You can even keep the udev
userland piping as a fallback if you want, but I think you can
simplify a lot of code if you phase it out. The firmware loading
should follow the same concept as modules loading.

I've heard that the udev userland piping of firmware is done to avoid
some licensing issues. But honestly, if you can not store the firmware
on the user's disk, no free operating system should support it at all.

This piping thing have been feature creep that have metastasized all
over the kernel while keeping a lot of obscure modules broken (in hard
to find way) and requiring increasingly complicated schemes to
workaround its flaws.

KiSS.
