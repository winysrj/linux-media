I'm not sure if this is the right list or not but I thought I would give 
it a try.

I've got a HVR-1600 which works great and I can get MythTV to record an 
analog and digital at the same time.

I decided that I needed a second tuner to record another digital signal. 
  I picked up an HVR-1250 (Linux sees it as a HVR-1255).  It's one of 
the newer cards in the 22xxx model.

Once I got it setup I could record two digtal's no problem but my analog 
on the 1600 lost audio.  It also won't tune above ch 13. I'm wondering 
if there is anything I can do to get these cards to play nicely.

Thanks
Stephen
