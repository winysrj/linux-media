Certainly, we can introduce plenty of new callbacks, another levels of 
indirection that would just obfuscate things. It should rather be done 
like v4l2-mem2mem does, where file operation handlers are implemented 
by each driver and from their open()/close() handlers relevant init
and release functions are called (v4l2_m2m_init/v4l2_m2m_release).

I think we can always change the kernel interfaces once there is more 
devices like OMAP4 FDIF. It may look easy for you when you refer to 
just one hardware implementation with your theoretically generic module. 
Or have you referred to other devices than OMAP4 FDIF when designing it ?

Consider scenario where one thread writes image data and multiple threads
read the FD results. Having all data discarded on first read only one 
thread could get the data. This is not what we want in a standard API.

Also in V4L2 it is always assumed that multiple applications can read
state of a device, and the application priority API [1] aims at
managing the devices state modifications among multiple processes.

Not necessarily, sometimes device specific logic needs to be implemented
in these callbacks. And the ioctl handlers (vidioc_*) should be just 
pass-through for the vb2 callbacks.

Right. This is a policy decision that this module makes for all future drivers
that would use it. Some hardware also allows to limit number of detected faces,
making it easy to allocate in advance the result data buffers.

The video device also represents a media entity. You would just have to
embed a media pad in the video device driver, so the first subdev can be 
linked to it. However the truth is that some devices might need a subdev 
instance to model FD engine, while for others it would be completely 
irrelevant.

I know from experience that inflexible frameworks are worse than no frameworks. 
And I feel we have not enough experience with the object detection devices 
right now to come up with decent generic kernel framework. With only one 
device using your generic OD module it just adds complexity and obfuscates 
things.

I'm still not convinced. I can't see a value in having generic module
the is used only by one driver, given diversity of nowadays media systems.

I finally managed to find a time to review it. Sorry about the delay.
