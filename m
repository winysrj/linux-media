I intended to submit this patch in a pull request, with subject line
fixed as mentioned in comments to the submitted match: 
https://patchwork.linuxtv.org/patch/48784

It might not be a big deal but it's not the first time patch gets
applied with review comments ignored. Then it looks like I acked 
something that I actually didn't.
