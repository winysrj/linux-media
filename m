Hi,

As you may have noticed, I'm very busy and my reviews are very slow lately. I'm
sorry for that, as my work pumps out every bit of energy I have.

Except for patch 11 where I'd like a little amendment, I have tested the full
serie, and my feeling is that things work at least as well as before, and
probably even better.

Therefore, as I won't have much time ahead, please find my ack, for the full serie:
Acked-by: Robert Jarzmik <robert.jarzmik@free.fr>

Cheers.
