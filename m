The alternative seems to be to define a device-sharing protocol for USB
drivers.  Kernel drivers would implement a new callback (asking them to
give up control of the device), and usbfs would implement new ioctls by
which a program could ask for and relinquish control of a device.  The
amount of rewriting needed would be relatively small.

A few loose ends would remain, such as how to handle suspends, resumes,
resets, and disconnects.  Assuming usbfs is the only driver that will
want to share a device in this way, we could handle them.

Hans, what do you think?
