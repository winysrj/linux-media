I am the one who has tried original Marton's patches this year.
After applying I was able to get stereo working with Aver TV Studio 303 
using mplayer / mencoder. When there were multiple audio streams 
broadcasted I was getting them in the respective channels I.E. I had no 
mono sound.
I am using this setup for recording only so actually this is great for 
me as I can do multidub rips when available.

Do you recommend to update to latest V4L and apply new patches?

Regards

Peter VÃ¡gner
