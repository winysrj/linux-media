Okay, are there some other cameras avaiable with 160x120 pixels or output in 
rgb? I only have an ARM Cortex-A8 with 500MHz to process the image data and 
converting between different pixelformats take a long time. So it would be 
fine if a resolution of 160x120 pixels is supported or the output is in rgb.

Hi Joern,

The resolutions are only 640x480 and 320x240. The images are transfered
in YUYV (16 bits YUV 4:2:2).
