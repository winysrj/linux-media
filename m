So, this is a bit of a blast from the past since the omap4 CEC development
has been on hold for almost a year. But I am about to resume my work on this
now that the CEC framework was merged.

The latest code is here, if you are interested:

https://git.linuxtv.org/hverkuil/media_tree.git/log/?h=panda-cec

It's pretty much unchanged from the version I posted a year ago, just rebased.

But before I continue with this I have one question for you. First some
background:

There is a special corner case (and I wasn't aware of that a year ago!) where
it is allowed to send a CEC message when there is *no HPD*.

The reason is that some displays turn off the hotplug detect pin when they go
into standby or when another input is active. The only way to communicate with
such displays is via CEC.

The problem is that without a HPD there is no EDID and basically no way for an
HDMI transmitter to detect that something is connected at all, unless you are
using CEC.

What this means is that if we want to implement this on the omap4 the CEC support
has to be on all the time.

We have seen modern displays that behave like this, so this is a real issue. And
this corner case is specifically allowed by the CEC specification: the Poll,
Image/Text View On and the Active Source messages can be sent to a TV even when
there is no HPD in order to turn on the display if it was in standby and to make
us the active input.

The CEC framework in the kernel supports this starting with 4.12 (this code is
in the panda-cec branch above).

If this *can't* be supported by the omap4, then I will likely have to add a CEC
capability to signal to the application that this specific corner case is not
supported.

I just did some tests with omap4 and I my impression is that this can't be
supported: when the HPD goes away it seems like most/all of the HDMI blocks are
all powered off and any attempt to even access the CEC registers will fail.

Changing this looks to be non-trivial if not impossible.

Can you confirm that that isn't possible? If you think this can be done, then
I'd appreciate if you can give me a few pointers.

Regards,

	Hans
