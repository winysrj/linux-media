Please do! That's an easy patch, and then it is clear someone is actively maintaining
this.

Good to know.

I will investigate this driver in more detail so I can explain what would be needed
to get this driver out of soc-camera.

BTW, vb1 refers to videobuf-core.h whereas vb2 refers to its successor videobuf2-core.h
and videobuf2-v4l2.h. The vb2 framework is vastly superior and integrates nicely with
dmabuf for buffer sharing between hardware components.
