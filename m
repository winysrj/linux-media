It is first time I hear about QEMU virtual CCID. Now we have all parts 
needed for USBIP VHCI and QEMU virtual CCID, just glue those together.

I wonder if it is wise to even create virtual CCID "core" to Kernel. 
There is few other readers that can use that too, actually I think all 
USB readers that have unique USB ID (blocking out those which uses 
USB-serial converters with common IDs).

As I see that CCID still more complex as serial device I will still look 
implementing it as serial as now.
