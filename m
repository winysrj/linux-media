Hello.

Today I became to be (un)happy owner of 06a2:0003 device. I found nice
discussion here in this list, but I've just subscribed to it.
So, I have some free time to test and improve existent code. If I will
be helpful, tell me, please!
(I'm using Fedora 9, but I could compile any additional driver for
that 2.6.27.15 kernel)
