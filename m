I use /dev/radio & /dev/video24 for FM radio using ivtv-radio, myself.

BTW, the cx18-alsa module annoys me as a developer.  PulseAudio holds
the device nodes open, pinning the cx18-alsa and cx18 modules in kernel.
When killed, PulseAudio respawns rapidly and reopens the nodes.
Unloading cx18 for development purposes is a real pain when the
cx18-alsa module exists.

Gah, I think you are right.  It probably was a multiple open() problem
on /dev/radio for the app author.

I do remember researching that cx18 and ivtv are single open()
on /dev/radio.

I also remember finding that the V4L2 spec doesn't require multiple
opens, and implies drivers need not support it in at least two places:

        "Multiple Opens
        
        In general, V4L2 devices can be opened more than once. When this
        is supported by the driver, ..."


        "Name
        v4l2-open â€” Open a V4L2 device
        
        ...
        
        EBUSY
                The driver does not support multiple opens and the
                device is already in use.
        ..."

Andy
