Reasons I'd like to keep both lists going:  

1. My subscription requests to linux-media have yielded nothing.  Anything broken with the approval process?

2. I agree with another poster: I only care about broadcast and cable video, both analog and digital.  I eventually hope to help get my "AnyTV AUTV002 USB ATSC/QAM Tuner Stick" supported by V4L, and then use it in a MythTV system.  I'd prefer a list that focuses on such devices and systems, if possible.  Which seems to match the mission of linux-dvb!

The general issue of multi-posting seems typical of list forking/merging/moving, and should settle down as the intent of each of the lists in the group of lists becomes better established in practice.
