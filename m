Hi all,

I have an ATI TV Wonder 600 USB and have successfully used it for its
DVB features, thanks to the work of many of you on this list. However,
this device also has an auxiliary s-video/composite input[1] which I'd
like to use in VLC, and I can't figure out how. Is there any capability
in the driver to switch to that?

I'm using kernel 2.6.32 on Debian, with firmware xc3028L-v36.fw. The
device's USB id is 0438:b002.

I'm happy to provide any other logs or info requested and appreciate any
help I can get.

Thanks!

Steve
