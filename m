Subject: Looking for a well suppord TV card with some requirements

Hi,

I am looking for a well support TV card with the following feature list:

   - Must have at least one tuner (PAL), preferably two
   - Must have composite input (for connecting a Nintendo Wii)
   - Should not have any delay between input signal and output
   - Works on kernel 2.6.18 (either vanilla, or by adding a driver)
   - Additionally, DVB-T would be nice

I bought a Hauppauge PVR-150 because I thought it complied to the above, 
but apparently (because it is an MPEG encoder and not a real TV card) 
there was a 2 second delay between the image from the Wii and the output 
on screen which is unacceptable for playing games.

(And the sound didn't work, but I didn't try to look for a solution 
because of the delay)

I still have an old Hauppauge WinTV card from 2000, based on the bttv 
driver which works fine, but does not have composite input.

Who can help me find something acceptable ?
