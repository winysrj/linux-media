While the DVB-T2 multiplex (MUX B) cannot be tuned by existing
DVB-T-only devices, and I don't know if the dvb-apps are being
prepared for DVB-T2 (there don't appear to be any of the
known DVB-S2 transponders listed in a couple positions), the
modulation parameters, for future reference, are probably
something like

+# T2 738000000 8MHz 2/3 NONE QAM256 32k 1/128 NONE	#E54 DVB-T2 HD MUX B

There may need to be additional details specified, I'm no expert.
These values are, of course, unconfirmed.

The same would be true for Crystal Palace at 10kW, but on channel
E31, or 554000000, no offset.
