I know a few people who have tried dvb-s2 v4l and all of them have had
problems.  From what I've been told, S2 is a total mess and has a ton
of things that need to be fixed.  I'm sure someone will crawl out of
the woodwork and state how awesome it is however so take everything
with a grain of salt and let your own experience tell you the truth.
