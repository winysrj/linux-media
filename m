I do try to handle patches sent to me for misc/ in time for the
different merge windows as that directory contains drivers that have
moved out of the staging/ directory.

But yes, I'm not the overall drivers/misc/ maintainer, do we really need
one?  If so, I can easily start maintaining a development tree for it to
keep it separate for the different driver authors to send me stuff and
start tracking it more "for real" if Arnd doesn't want to do it.
