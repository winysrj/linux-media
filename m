None of the patches of this series were caught by patchwork :(

Btw, patchwork is broke again today: it is refusing to accept any commands to
update via pwclient interface. On the last 7 days, I counted 7 days of partial
outage at patchwork :(

It is time for us move from patchwork to something that works. 

I intend to finish to apply the patches that patchwork caught and work on another 
process to get those patches from my imap server, probably writing a script using
perl Mail::IMAPClient. The bad news is that, without patchwork, we'll loose some
visibility about the patch status. I need to think a little more about that.
