I've also raised the issue for ARM. However, I don't see what is the
big problem.

A generic solution (that I think I already proposed) would be to
reserve a chunk of memory for the CMA that can be removed from the
normally mapped kernel memory through memblock at boot time. The size
of this memory region would be configurable through kconfig. Then, the
CMA would have a "dma" flag or something, and take chunks out of it
until there's no more, and then return errors. That would work for
ARM.

Cheers.
