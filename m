Your points are duly noted ... and I have attempted to convey the crux
of your message in the note provided here:

Well, in these particular regards, I can only reply with what I have
previously noted in the wiki in several places, such as:
- from the Main page "welcome" message:   "Like all other wikis, the
V4L-DVB wiki relies upon the contributions of its users. Hence, it will
only be as useful as we make it!"
- from the DVB-T PCI Cards' note entitled "Please be aware that":  "The
information contained here is likely non-exhaustive and, despite best
efforts to do otherwise, may contain errors. (Please help to keep these
lists up-to-date so that they are useful for everyone!)"
