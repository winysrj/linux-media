Hi Grant,

thank you for the comments.

Alright. The main point of this binding is that the devices may have
multiple distinct ports that each can be connected to other devices.
So, contrary to the other graph bindings, devices are not simple nodes
in a directed graph. For example a single capture device with two
separate inputs connected to camera sensors:

	,--------.
	| cam [port]-.   ,-----------------.
	`--------´    `-[port@0] capture   |
	,---------.   ,-[port@1] interface |
	| cam [port]-´   `-----------------´
	`---------´

Or two separate display controllers with two parallel outputs each, a
4-port multiplexer, and an encoder (e.g. lvds):

	,------------------.
	| display    [port@0]--.   ,-------------.
	| controller [port@1]-. `-[port@0]       |
	`------------------´   `--[port@1]  mux  |
	,------------------.   ,--[port@2]       |    ,-------------.
	| display    [port@0]-´ ,-[port@3] [port@4]--[port] encoder |
	| controller [port@1]--´   `-------------´    `-------------´
	`------------------´

Optionally, the same with the multiplexer integrated into the
encoder device:

	,------------------.
	| display    [port@0]--.   ,----------------.
	| controller [port@1]-. `-[port@0]          |
	`------------------´   `--[port@1] encoder  |
	,------------------.   ,--[port@2] with mux |
	| display    [port@0]-´ ,-[port@3]          |
	| controller [port@1]--´   `----------------´
	`------------------´

Or display controller, encoder, and panel:

 ,--------.    ,---------.
 | dc [port]--[port@0]   |
 `--------´    | encoder |    ,-----------.
               |   [port@1]--[port] panel |
               `---------´    `-----------´

Ok. In principle it would be possible to use the same scheme for other
connections than data links.

According to video-interfaces.txt, it is expected that endpoints contain
phandles pointing to the remote endpoint on both sides. I'd like to
leave this up to the more specialized bindings, but I can see that this
makes enumerating the connections starting from each device tree node
easier, for example at probe time.
If the back links are not provided in the device tree, a device at the
receiving end of a remote-endpoint phandle can only know about connected
remote ports after the kernel parsed the whole graph and created the
back links itself.

On the other hand it is really easy to test for and warn about missing
or misdirected backlinks.

But this is not what the current binding in video-interfaces.txt
describes. I don't think it is a good idea to explicitly forbid
backlinks in this binding.
