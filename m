Because they are insufficient.  Either that or I don't understand gfp_t.

With CMA, platform can define many memory types.  For instance, if there are
two memory bans there can be two memory types for the two banks.  For at least one
of the device I'm in contact with, another type for it's firmware is also needed.
Bottom line is that there may be possibly many types which won't map to gfp_t.

Two things: I'd prefer a "cma" prefix rather then "dev" and I think it should
be "pages", right? Then, size should be given in pages rather then bytes.

Nonetheless, I don't really see at the moment why this should be better.

I'll try to look at it later on and think about it.  I'm still somehow reluctant
to change the names but still, thank you for suggestions.
