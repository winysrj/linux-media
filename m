Well a problem which wasn't mentioned so far is that while GPUs do have 
a page table to mirror the CPU page table, they usually can't recover 
from page faults.

So what we do is making sure that all memory accessed by the GPU Jobs 
stays in place while those jobs run (pretty much the same pinning you do 
for the DMA).

But since this can lock down huge amounts of memory the whole command 
submission to GPUs is bound to the memory management. So when to much 
memory would get blocked by the GPU we block further command submissions 
until the situation resolves.

Depends on the policy in command, but currently it's the other way 
around most of the time.

E.g. we allocate memory in VRAM, the CPU writes to it WC and avoids 
reading because that is slow, the GPU in turn can access it with full speed.

When we run out of VRAM we move those allocations to system memory and 
update both the CPU as well as the GPU page tables.

So that move is transparent for both userspace as well as shaders 
running on the GPU.

The whole purpose of this effort is that we can do I/O on VRAM directly 
without migrating everything back to system memory.

Allowing this, but then doing the migration by the first touch of the 
CPU is clearly not a good idea.
