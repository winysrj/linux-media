Ok, I'm happy to hear that the thing should be fixed. My grepping
still found a fair amount of EINVAL returns both in code and in the
Documentation subdirectory for media ioctls, but it really was just
grepping with a few lines of context, so I didn't look closer at the
semantics. I was just looking for certain patterns (ie grepping for
"EINVAL" near ioctl or ENOIOCTLCMD etc) that I thought might indicate
problem spots, and the media subdirectory had a lot of them.

Can you test the patch with some media capture apps (preferably with
the obvious fix for the problem that Paulo already pointed out -
although that won't actually matter until some block driver starts
using ENOIOCTLCMD there, so even the unfixed patch should mostly work
for testing)?
