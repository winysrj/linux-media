Ehh...., this is very embarrassing, but please disregard all my
statements about a hanging system related to IRQF_DISABLED.

It turns out that I've had a faulty SATA hard drive which probably have
caused all these problems.  I do not understand the inner workings of
the SATA hardware and software, but it appears that this drive has been
able to block interrupts for a considerable time without SMART detecting
any error at all.  I wrongly suspected saa7146 to be the cause because
these problems appeared after adding the saa7146 hardware.  But that was
probably just a coincidence (or maybe not really, only unrelated: I
suspect that the problem was triggered by the powercycle when adding
this card)

The drive has now been replaced, and I will start verifying that use of
saa7146 with IRQF_DISABLED does not in fact pose any real problems at
all.

I still find the discussion about it's usefulness interesting though...

Yes, it probably was ignored.  Sorry for not being able to sort that out
earlier.

Because any other driver sharing the interrupt otherwise will cause
unpredictable results.  

But your suggestions that one should be able to detect the current state
and make system level policy decision would make that argument void, and
are generally much better solutions.

Sure, I can see that problem.  But you can't avoid it unless you find
some way to ensure that IRQF_DISABLED is enforced.  And today, that
would mean not sharing at all, would it not?

Sounds like a solution to me.

And the current warning should be disabled in case 1, as the behaviour
is predictable.  But this means that the kernel also need to be smart
enough to notice both when the case changes from 1 to 3 and from 2 to 3.

OK.

Yes, that would be useful.  Like it is now, you have to inspect the
source code and the current driver load order to know the actual state.
