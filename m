What that means is that the presence of the fault *on the chip* may limit
the device's willingness to actually strobe. The driver does not need to
enforce it; the chip does.

The V4L2 control's unit is mA. Does this mean that the unit in the LED API
also becomes mA then?

The application's resources are released by the kernel when the application
exists but V4L2 control's don't behave that way.

How about using the information on open file handles to the flash sub-device
instead? If someone holds a file handle there, sure then the device is in
use by that program? The advantage compared to the control value is that the
file handles are released when the application quits whether or not any
cleanup is performed by the application. I don't immediately see other
reasons to keep a file handle to a V4L2 flash sub-device open, except, well,
to find about its capabilities.

Have you seen a LED flash controller which does not implement the torch
mode?

I have no objections to keeping the check though, but there were more
important things missing at the time.
