Today I had the chance to test these patches with a Hauppauge HVR-930c.
Couldn't test analog TV (not supported yet), but DVB works fine, too.

So patches 1 to 21 have been tested now and do at least not cause any
regressions.

I would like to drop the last two patches (22+23) of this series, because
- they are actually not related to USB bulk transfers
- patch 22 needs to be fixed for analog+vbi (will get an analog device
for testing next week)
- I'm working on further improvements/changes in this area (including
em25xx support)
So I will better come up with a separate patch series later.

Will send a v2 of this patch series soon.

Regards,
Frank
