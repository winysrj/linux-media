hi all, i am pretty new to video for linux. Last weekend i have 
successfully installed aver nv3000 (4 analog video-in pci card) on my 
debian machine. As i am new to video, i quickly found out that many 
cards have only one chip for 4 video inputs and work with signal as 
channels 1-4(as /dev/video0 witch 4 channels). My question is if there 
is some documentation or whatever where can i start to learn how to work 
with these multi channels to be able to view all 4 channels at the same 
time. When searching the web i found some software called zone minder, 
where they have the source in perl, so i hope i can understand their 
solution to use it in different place.

thank you very much for any advice or showing me the right place where 
to start, have a nice day
pavel
