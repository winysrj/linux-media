That sounds good to me, I'll be glad to collect the patches and push
them to Linus for both of those trees (might as well keep them in the
same git tree, no need to separate them, right?) and I'll rely on you
for review and acking them.  Much like I do today for the tty and serial
trees.

I'll go set up the trees locally today and when kernel.org opens back
up, make them public and add them to linux-next.
