Yeah. Documentation patches are harder to handle than normal patches. I did several
changes on the existing patches, but perfecting each patch individually will probably
take forever.

Thanks!

Yes, that's my plan. Having both patch series merged together seemed a good idea to me, as
it becomes easier for applications to benefit of that.
