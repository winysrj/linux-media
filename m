Hy there,
My name is Rafael Vieira. Sorry, if I say something stupid, but let me
share with you my point of view, and you can correct me at anytime.
I have a USB PixelView SBTVD Hybrid device and it seems to me that the
only thing that keeps it from working is its firmware. Since there is
a younger brother from this board
http://dougsland.livejournal.com/103169.html that works already. I
found a rom(merlinD.rom that I can send it to the list, if you want),
from the CD of the device, that I suspect is its firmware.
Yes, I've heard of usbsnoop, but my question is, if I have the
firmware(If I'm right), can't I just rename it? Or do some operation
directly on the firmware? Do I really need to use usbsnoop? (I didn't
wan't to install windows to do this, honestly)


Thanks,

Rafael Vieira - programmer and student.
