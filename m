You can create something similar to the existing API for memory
allocator.

For example, blk_kmalloc/blk_alloc_pages was proposed as memory
allocator API with notion of an address range for allocated memory. It
wasn't merged for other reasons though.

I don't mean that this is necessary for the inclusion (I'm not the
person to ack or nack this). I just expect the similarity of memory
allocator API.

Well, why can't we do the above before the inclusion?

Anyway, I think that comments from mm people would be helpful to merge
this.
