The lack of TX capability does necessitate switching to an A31 compatible.
So yes, please switch. Lets leave the A10s/A13 alone for now, unless
someone complains. I think this was done from inception, so if it was
broken, someone should've complained a long time ago. I just want to
be sure where the error is, and put in a comment explaining it. However
I don't have the hardware either.
