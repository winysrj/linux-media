I think the rule is "no regressions". Was cx231xx broken by some recent
change or was it broken forever?

Anyway the patch itself is in -next as of next-20101019. What the hell
is -next good for then if people skip it? (Yes, 10 workdays is too few
for people to really test kernels. Especially when we are talking about
DVB.)

What about this hunk? Could it be a source of the problem?

I will test whatever you send me. I have nothing to test yet...

So I personally NACK this patch whatever it means.
