The API will round up so that the correct region covers the API.
However, if you have other structures packed into the space (as very
often happens on stack), you get cache line interference in the CPU if
they get accessed:  The act of accessing an adjacent object pulls in
cache above your object and destroys DMA coherence.  This is the
principle reason why DMA to stack is a bad idea.

No, it doesn't take any precautions like this.  the DMA API is just
mapping (possibly via an IOMMU).  If the transfer times out, that's done
in the DMA engine of the card, and must be cleaned up by the driver and
unmapped.

The general rule though is never DMA to stack.  On some processors, the
way stack is allocated can actually make this not work.
