I understand your point.

I tryed this. Also I was in that country last week to record a near 
country, and I personally checked that wasn't heat problem (I have 
remote hands there which reported me the same).

Before going there, I got same idea you're proposing so I implemented 
into restart script a 5 minutes delay before tuning it again. I also 
tryied 10 minutes to be sure that wasn't heat problem.

And regarding 2 hours, normally it's about 2 or 3 days before fails. 
Sometimes it's some hours later. Totally random. For example today I 
restarted this morning, and no failure for the moment on any of both 
transponders.

The problem is really very strange.
