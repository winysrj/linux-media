Thank you!

I've just posted a little patch that adds function descriptions,
hopefully that is one step in the right direction.

Yeah, supporting USERPTR with vivi sounds like a good plan. I'm not
sure how much work it involves though. The comment in the
videobuf-vmalloc header says that the buffer code assumes that the
driver does not touch the data, but I think that's exactly how vivi
generates the frame data for us. =)

I need to figure out the best way to grab references to user space
pages and map them virtually contiguous like vmalloc does. This will
take a bit of time, so don't expect anything submitted in time for
v2.6.31. I've put it fairly high on my TODO list.

Thanks for your help!
