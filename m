The board had a pull-down 4k7 resistor which I removed in these lines
(D8/D9). The board is prepared to accept sensors from 8 to 12 bits,
lines from D8 to D12 have a pull-down resistor to tie down the line by
default.

With the oscilloscope I saw that D8/D9 had problems to go to high
level like you said, then I checked the schematic and I saw these
resistors.

The datasheet (p.10,11) says that the Pixel Color Pattern is as follows.

<------------------------ direction
n  4    3    2    1
.. GB GB GB GB
.. RG RG RG RG

So seems you're right, if the first byte is on the right the sensor
produces BGGR. But for some reason the mt9v032 driver uses GRBG data.
Maybe is related with following lines which writes register 0x0D Read
Mode (p.26,27) and presumably flips row or column bytes (not sure
about this I need to check)

334         /* Configure the window size and row/column bin */
335         hratio = DIV_ROUND_CLOSEST(crop->width, format->width);
336         vratio = DIV_ROUND_CLOSEST(crop->height, format->height);
337
338         ret = mt9v032_write(client, MT9V032_READ_MODE,
339                     (hratio - 1) <<
MT9V032_READ_MODE_ROW_BIN_SHIFT |
340                     (vratio - 1) << MT9V032_READ_MODE_COLUMN_BIN_SHIFT);

Nonetheless, I changed the driver to configure for BGGR pattern. Using
the Sensor->CCDC->Preview->Resizer pipeline I captured the data with
yavta and converted using raw2rgbpnm program.

    ./raw2rgbpnm -s 752x480 -f UYVY img-000001.uyvy img-000001.pnm

and the result is

The image looks better than older, not perfect, but better. The image
is only a bit yellowish. Could be this a hardware issue ? We are close
to ...
