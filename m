I have a Canalsat (in the caribbean) subscription and, with MythTV at 
least I just had to plug in the cam, put the subscription card in it 
and voila!
The TV application must "talk" to the cam; also there are some cams 
which are known not to work well/reliably with the TT CI.
For my part I am more than happy with my aston crypt CAM which can 
decrypt two streams simultanueously, which means you can watch 2 
channels (on different PC or using PIP) or record two, or watch one 
record one, just one restriction though: they have to be on the same
 transponder.
HTH
Bye
