Please see the discussions about that at:

If there are enough user-only threads and enough users intended to have
discussions that aren't interesting for developers, nor needs developers
answers, then, we can create later a v4l-dvb-users ML. 

However, what I've seen since the creation of linux-media is that the
discussions on linux-dvb are interesting also for developers, and are posted
there, instead of linux-media, just because people were still thinking that
such discussions should be handled there.

For now, it seems better to focus everything into one ML.

Someone proposed to send a daily email asking for people at linux-dvb to use
linux-media instead, but this is a sort of unsolicited bulk email (aka: SPAM).
It is better to warn just the ones that are still posting at linux-dvb about
the changes.
