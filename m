If performing divides on 64 bit numbers, please check to make sure your
code compiles, links, and loads on a 32-bit system.

We've had problems in the past in where gcc will build the module to
reference __udivdi3 under 32-bit kernels; but that symbol is not in the
kernel.

Search for 'do_div' in:

	linux/drivers/media/video/cx18/cx18-av-core.c

for a simple example divide that works on both 64 and 32 bit machines.

Regards,
Andy
