Nice

Ok, to be flexible and consistent, we could do the same as with other 
parameters. We could design a query like "to which pin can you route data 
lane 1?" with possible replies "I can only route lane 1 to pin 1," or "I 
can route lane 1 to pins 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5" (for 4 data-lanes and one clock 
lane. Then the configuration request could do "please, route your data 
lane 1 to pin 1." Or we can hard-code this routing in the platform data 
for now.

I, probably, already mentioned this before, but this is also how the 
present soc-camera API evolved in the past: in the beginning it also was 
completely static, then I noticed, that instead of hard coding the 
configuration, I can let drivers negotiate parameters automatically. Then 
gradually the number of auto-negotiated parameters grew, as more flexible 
hardware had to be handled.

We could do the same here: first hard-code this, then see, if it is 
becoming a burden, having to hard-code these. Notice, that 
auto-configuring these should not be a problem. This is not like 
configuring a signal polarity, of which one can work better, than the 
other.

Well, yes, a union can be a good idea, thanks.

Disagree, O'm quite happy with the current flag system, used for both 
capabilities and configuration.

Yes, but what exactly do you want to make configurable? The _number_ of 
lanes, or their routing?

Thanks
