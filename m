I'm confused why you think this email was a flame.  It's asked three
very straight-forward questions that could have easily have been asked
of any submitter who failed to cc: the maintainer for a particular
driver in the patch submission.

Stating that a clerical error had been made during the git send-email
and thus you forwarded it to him in private would have been a
perfectly reasonable answer to my question.

No need to create drama where there isn't any.
