It's easy to merge unlock_single and unlock, which I did in the next version I'll post.
Lockdep will already warn if ww_mutex_lock and ww_mutex_lock_single are both
used. ww_test_block_context and ww_test_context_block in lib/locking-selftest.c
are the testcases for this.

The locking paths are too different, it will end up with doing "if (ctx == NULL) mutex_lock(); else ww_mutex_lock();"
