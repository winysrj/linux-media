There are several things that are very bad on passing a table via
platform data:

	1) you're adding saa711x-specific data at the bridge driver,
	   so, the saa711x code is spread on several places at the
	   long term;

	2) some part of the saa711x code may override the data there, 
	   as it is not aware about what bits should be preserved from
	   the new device;

	3) due (2), latter changes on the code are more likely to
	   cause regressions;

	4) also due to (2), some hacks can be needed, in order to warn
	   saa711x to handle some things differently.

That's why it is a way better to add meaningful parameters telling what
bits are needed for the driver to work with the bridge. That's also
why we do this with all other drivers.
