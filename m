I just had a look myself. carma has been removed fortunately in linux-next,
so we don't have to worry about that any more.

I assume that the sst-firmware.c case is a mistake, it should just use a
plain DMA_SLAVE and not DMA_MEMCPY.

Aside from these, everyone else uses either DMA_CYCLIC in addition to
DMA_SLAVE, which seems valid, or they use DMA_PRIVATE, which I think is
redundant in slave drivers and can be removed.

What I meant was that we don't need to handle them with the unified
simple interface. The users of DMA_CYCLIC can just keep using
an internal helper that only deals with the legacy case, or use
dma_request_slave() or whatever is the new API for the DT case.
