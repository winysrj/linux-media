OK.

What about graph_ as the internal prefix? Or mctl_?

So now we have SDTV and HDTV, the next entity will have YUV_420 and YUV_422 pads,
or whatever. The number of types will quickly escalate. It's similar to the
'entity type' problem (e.g. sensor, flash, video encoder, scaler, etc.).

I think names would work: we can make a number of 'core' names that should be
used where appropriate, and leave it up to the driver otherwise.

So if there is only one video source pad, then call the pad "video". If there
are multiple video source pads, then zero or one pads can be called "video",
the others should get different names "video-sdtv").

To be honest, I'm not terribly keen on this. I think a data/pad type + name
would work better.

OK, so everything has to be copied in userspace, unpacking the objects.

Type can be dropped.

This makes more sense without the pointer. But this also means that the
objects pointer in media_graph_topology isn't an array. Instead the
next graph object starts at ((void *)objects + objects->length).

That's not what I meant. If we end up with so many different object types,
then the MC API has gone crazy and becomes unusable. The MC is supposed
to have just a few types: originally entity, pad, link and now we are adding
interface and property. Perhaps there will be one or two more, but if we
end up with 30 types, then there is something seriously wrong.

Doing it this way means that you return a blob that needs to be unpacked
first. It's useless without that unpacking step. Is that what I want? I
would like to hear what others think about this. It makes this a very
complicated and hard-to-use ioctl.
