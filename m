Thanks to tremendous help from folks who are passionate about seeing Linux work with my WinTV-HVR-1800 card, I'm alllllllmost watching television.  I have used scandvb, found some digital channels, verified that my card works and my cable line has some digital signal...and used a script from DVB Search to pare the channels to a few working channels rather than the 300 plus that were found to have signal.

My question is, from this point, what do I need to do?  I don't mind using a simple command line if need be, and I tried to install MythTV and got mired in a dependency issue related to an extinct library that's somehow still "required."  I just want to watch a program...I don't need to record it or anything.  I don't care if I'm watching an mpg stream from the card or watching live tv (if there's even a difference).

Are there any command line things I can type to tune to a particular channel and watch it for a while?  

Can I use Mplayer, Kaffeine, or Xine?

Am I better off trying to use something like TVTime or Xawtv (which appears to be only for analog channels, and I'm using digital ones.)

Any help or suggestions would be wonderful.  Thank you in advance.
