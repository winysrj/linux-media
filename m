Subject: [PATCH] dma-fence: dma-buf synchronization
Date: Wed, 11 Jul 2012 17:29:41 -0500
Message-Id: <1342045781-29351-1-git-send-email-rob.clark@linaro.org>
Sender: linux-media-owner@vger.kernel.org
List-ID: <linux-media.vger.kernel.org>

From: Rob Clark <rob@ti.com>

A dma-fence can be attached to a buffer which is being filled or consumed
by hw, to allow userspace to pass the buffer without waiting to another
device.  For example, userspace can call page_flip ioctl to display the
next frame of graphics after kicking the GPU but while the GPU is still
rendering.  The display device sharing the buffer with the GPU would
attach a callback to get notified when the GPU's rendering-complete IRQ
fires, to update the scan-out address of the display, without having to
wake up userspace.

A dma-fence is transient, one-shot deal.  It is allocated and attached
to dma-buf's list of fences.  When the one that attached it is done,
with the pending operation, it can signal the fence removing it from the
dma-buf's list of fences:

  + dma_buf_attach_fence()
  + dma_fence_signal()

Other drivers can access the current fence on the dma-buf (if any),
which increment's the fences refcnt:

  + dma_buf_get_fence()
  + dma_fence_put()

The one pending on the fence can add an async callback (and optionally
cancel it.. for example, to recover from GPU hangs):

  + dma_fence_add_callback()
  + dma_fence_cancel_callback()

Or wait synchronously (optionally with timeout or from atomic context):

  + dma_fence_wait()

A default software-only implementation is provided, which can be used
by drivers attaching a fence to a buffer when they have no other means
for hw sync.  But a memory backed fence is also envisioned, because it
is common that GPU's can write to, or poll on some memory location for
synchronization.  For example:

  fence = dma_buf_get_fence(dmabuf);
  if (fence->ops == &mem_dma_fence_ops) {
    dma_buf *fence_buf;
    mem_dma_fence_get_buf(fence, &fence_buf, &offset);
    ... tell the hw the memory location to wait on ...
  } else {
    /* fall-back to sw sync * /
    dma_fence_add_callback(fence, my_cb);
  }

The memory location is itself backed by dma-buf, to simplify mapping
to the device's address space, an idea borrowed from Maarten Lankhorst.

NOTE: the memory location fence is not implemented yet, the above is
just for explaining how it would work.

On SoC platforms, if some other hw mechanism is provided for synchronizing
between IP blocks, it could be supported as an alternate implementation
with it's own fence ops in a similar way.

The other non-sw implementations would wrap the add/cancel_callback and
wait fence ops, so that they can keep track if a device not supporting
hw sync is waiting on the fence, and in this case should arrange to
call dma_fence_signal() at some point after the condition has changed,
to notify other devices waiting on the fence.  If there are no sw
waiters, this can be skipped to avoid waking the CPU unnecessarily.

The intention is to provide a userspace interface (presumably via eventfd)
later, to be used in conjunction with dma-buf's mmap support for sw access
to buffers (or for userspace apps that would prefer to do their own
synchronization).
