Can I get as much disassembly of the PAC7302 drivers with your comments next to 
it? I am trying to improve my webcam and currently disassembling the driver, in 
Vista64 with IDA Pro. (I still have the 32 bit driver files as I upgraded from 
xp32) 
I am helping on the gAIM/Pidgin voice/video chat and this driver isn't where I  
would like it to be. I need better color balance, even after changing alot of 
options I still turn out orange quite a bit. 
I have Assembly expierence, I own the Intel Instruction Manuals, so figuring out 
the actual given driver with a little bit of help based on the current progress 
should not be difficult
