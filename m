Isn't a discussion part of how information is conveyed and finding parts=20
that require more knowledge?

I'm sorry, I'm not sure I follow you here. What do you mean I don't have=20
any interest in where TSN comes from? or the reason why 1722 use IEC 61883?=
=20
What about "they picked 61883 because it made sense?"

gPTP itself is *not* about transffering audio-data, it is about agreeing on=
=20
a common time so that when you *do* transfer audio-data, the samplerate=20
actually means something.

Let me ask you this; if you have 2 sound-cards in your computer and you=20
want to attach a mic to one and speakers to the other, how do you solve=20
streaming of audio from the mic to the speaker If you answer does not=20
contain something akin to "different timing-domain issues", I'd be very=20
surprised.

If you are interested in TSN for transferring *anything*, _including_=20
audio, you *have* to take gPTP into consideration. Just as you have to=20
think about stream reservation, compliant hardware and all the different=20
subsystems you are going to run into, either via kernel or via userspace.

No, I do not.

I have only passing knowledge of the firewire standard, I've looked at the=
=20
encoding described in 1722 and added that to the alsa shim as an example of=
=20
how to use TSN. As I stated, this was a *very* early version and I would=20
like to use TSN for audio - and more work is needed.

There are tons of details left and right, and as I said, I'm not  all to=20
familiar with firewire. I know that one of the authors behind the firewire=
=20
standard happened to be part of 1722 standard.

I am currently working my way through the firewire-stak paper you've=20
written, and I have gotten a lot of pointers to other areas I need to dig=
=20
into so I should be busy for a while.

That being said, Richard's point about a way to find sample-rate of a=20
hardware device and ways to influence that, is important for AVB/TSN.
