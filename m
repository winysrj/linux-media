Waking up the entire hardware just because an IRQ was triggered doesn't seem
a good idea on PC's. Here, I had to put the IR sensors behind the table
to avoid receiving too many noise from my room's lamp.
If I put it on the right place, I start receiving several of glitches per
second. I doubt this would be useful for suspend/resume operations.
