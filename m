this may be a busted switch

i have a dm1105 connected to 4 lnbs via a 4 way switch

i've checked each lnb individually and i can tune to boradcasts on each 
one when i am not using the switch

however i can only tune to lnbs on the first two positions but not the 
third and fourth

has anyone else had this problem?
