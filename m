I think we decided to completely leave cpu virtual mappings out of the
API to start with, because (a) we can already get significant value
out of the API without this, and (b) it is not quite clear how to
handle virtual mappings in a way that can deal with all cases.  For
now, userspace virtual mappings must come from the exporting device,
and kernel virtual mappings (if needed by the importing device) are
not supported.. although I think it is a smaller subset of devices
that might need a kernel virtual mapping.

This sidesteps the whole issue of cache handling, avoiding aliased
mappings, etc.  And leaves cpu access synchronization and cache
handling to be handled however the exporting device handles this
today.
