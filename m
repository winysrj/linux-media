The led support could be #ifdef CONFIG_LEDS_CLASS, the problem with that
approach is the whole module versus build-in thing:

led-class	shark		enable-led-support
build-in	build-in	yes
build-in	module		yes
module		build-in	no
module		module		yes

Now this can be coded into #ifdef magic, but it won't be pretty,
of course we only need the non pretty version once at the top
to set a SHARK_USE_LEDS define, but still.

I'm fine with either solution (depends or ifdef magic), although
I think that people will get unpleasantly surprised if they want
to use the shark driver and they don't get to see it in the
menu because they don't have leds enabled.

Regards,

Hans
