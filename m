My advice: choose hardware that already has good kernel and userspace
(if needed) support, even if it's not the best hardware solution.

Then you will "only" have to put together various pieces of software
to get what you want. When you have a working prototype then you can
think about switching to the best hardware, develop kernel drivers...
