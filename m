Hello Greg,

Thanks for reviewing the sysfs part.  Actually, I was never really sure
if I shouldn't rather put this code to debugfs and you got me convinced
that I should.  Sysfs somehow looked more appealing from kernel's API
point of view -- things seem to be more organised in sysfs than in
debugfs.  It seems I'll have to port it to debugfs after all

Nonetheless, a few responses to your comments:

Aren't thing like cpufreq governors listed in a single sysfs file?
I remember there was such a file somewhere.  Has that been made
deprecated? I cannot seem to find any information on that.

regions is actually a directory with subdirectories for each
region. ;)

I prefer being on the safe side -- I have no idea what user will provide
as region name so I assume as little as possible.  For numeric values you
are right that snprintf() is a bit paranoid, still I see no good reason
why not to use it.
