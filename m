Hello,
I have seen that the v4l-dvb modules work only for kernel > 2.6.15. I
have a Pinnacle 72e USB DVB-T stick i would like to use with a 2.6.15
(ARM)kernel. This would be a dibcom 0700 driver. Is there any
possibilty at all to get this working, or do I have to get a dvb-t usb
stick that is supported by the 2.6.15 kernel? How good was the dvb-t
support using the 2.6.15 kernel? Thanks for any help.
