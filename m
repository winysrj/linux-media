This is not a sort of game to see who has a better solution for end users.

A company that has a serious commit to open source opens their datasheets to
allow public development and contributions and submit patches regularly
upstream, without any userspace hooks.

Closed source drivers don't fit well at open source market. There are lots of
examples of failures to this approach with all sorts of vendors, and lots of
buyers decision of not buying a card X because open source driver doesn't exist
or is crappy.

Anyway, it might have some space for your driver, but not on this forum.

Cheers,
Mauro
