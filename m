One typical scenario we would like to support is full-hd decoding. One frame is
about 4MB (1920x1080x2 ~= 4MB). Depending on the codec, it may require up to 15
buffers what gives about 60MB. This simple calculation does not include memory
for the framebuffer, temporary buffers for the hardware codec and buffers for 
the stream.

Hmmm, right, this might also help solving the problem.
