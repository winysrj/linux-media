Hello,
I successfully use a Terratec Cinergy HTC Stick HD (ID 0ccd:00b2) in
my Ubuntu 12.10 machine (Kernel  3.5.0-28).

I just had to plug it in and it worked out of the box with tvheadend,
i also didn't need to add any firmware.

I noticed that only DVB-C seems to work out-of-the-box, but in my
opinion it can be added in the wiki as a working DVB-C device.

Thanks a lot in advance for your efforts!
All the best!

J.H.
