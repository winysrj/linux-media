Thank you for the clarification.

When a driver is merged for the first time in the kernel it is always as
a single change, i.e. you don't include the development history as that
would pollute the kernel's history. Those earlier versions have never
been tested/reviewed to the same extent as the final version and adding
them could break git bisect. So as a general rule this isn't done.

Your code is attributed in the source code and your patches are all archived
in patchwork and on mailinglist archives.

And should you decide to make patches for the merged driver adding back the
lost functionality, then feel free to yell loudly at Ezequiel in the commit
log (within reason, of course :-) ). Heck, I might add some lines of my own
to that.

It is a quite unusual situation and the only way I could make it worse would
by not merging anything.
