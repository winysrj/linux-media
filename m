I'm afraid that there may be my missing points. I'm confusing. who is
Importer and who is Exporter you think? Importer is fd goes to private
buffer and Exporter is private buffer goes to fd? if so, yes, when the
importer needs to drop that reference(the importer want to release
that buffer), dma_buf_put() should be called somewhere and in my case,
that function is called by drm_prime_gem_destory(). this function is
included at Dave's patch sets and also dma_buf_detatch() is called
there. and I just thought that here is right place. I didn't find the
place dma_buf_put() is called anywhere. could you please tell me where
dma_buf_put() should be called at you think?.

for this, you can refer to Dave's repository:
http://cgit.freedesktop.org/~airlied/linux/log/?h=drm-prime-dmabuf

 I mean  when fd goes to private buffer, that reference(file->f_count)
would be increased by dma_buf_get() and  only ->detach is used to drop
that reference.

yes, my understanding is that if user app requested close(fd) call to
the Importer, after close(fd), file->f_count would be decreased but
would still has 1. because file->f_count already was 1 by the
Exporter.

I need to stop the confusing. thank you for your answer. :)
