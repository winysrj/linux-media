I agree with that: devnodes should be entities, as they're the points to control
the hardware, and need to be known by the Kernel, no matter if they have DMA
engines associated with it or not. The better seems to map the DMA engine
as a property on those entities.

It should be easy to create an entity for each v4l-subdev node. I just
don't see much usage on it, and this will almost double the number of
entities. Also, in order to keep it backward-compatible, both the subdev
devnode and the subdev no-devnode entity should accept the same set of
ioctls.
