(apologies for delayed reply - I am travelling in Europe this month
and not checking all my email every day)

Mauro,

get_if_frequency will work, but for *optimal* settings for the
hardware that my company manufactures, this is it.  The hardcoded IF
is the correct setting for *this* hardware.  There are more factors
than just a tuner and demodulator, here.  I know the board layout and
the crystal configurations, and we did extensive testing.  Sure, you
can use get_if_frequency and it will "work" ... but when I have
information about how it will work *best* then you should merge my
patch.

This is the fix.  You can merge it or you will not merge it.  I did my
part, Mauro.  My customers need this fix and I will not argue.

ALSO, for -stable, there is no get_if_frequency.  I cannot have the
patch merged into stable unless you merge it into mainline. There is
no time for opinion - only facts.  Please merge.

-MK
