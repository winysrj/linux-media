Yes :)

I guess no one reads cover letters, but indeed. To be clear, this last
patch should only go in after a few kernels from now all kthreads
are vetted for piece-meal wise.

This patch would be the nail on the kthread freezer coffin. It should
go in last, who knows how many years from now, and if ever.
