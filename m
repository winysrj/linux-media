I'm not sure what you mean by "natural alignment".  If 1M alignment of a 64K buffer
is natural then yes, presented API requires alignment to be natural.  In short,
alignment must be a power of two and is never less then a PAGE_SIZE but can be more
then the size of the requested chunk.

Yes.  I hope to came up with a CMA version that will allow reserved spec to be
reused by the rest of memory management code.  For now, I won't respond to your
suggestions regarding the use of page allocator but I hope to write something
later today in response to Peter's and Minchan's mails.  I'll make sure to cc you
as well.

It's in the header to allow cma_info() and cma_info_about() to be static inlines.
The idea is not to generate too many exported symbols.  Also, it's not like usage
of __cma_info() is in any way more dangerous then cma_info() or cma_info_about().

No WARN() is generated but -ENOENT is returned so it is considered an error.
I've also changed the code to use pr_err() when chunk is not found (it used
pr_debug() previously).

I'm still wondering whether the use of address is the best idea or whether
passing a cma_chunk structure would be a better option.  In this way, cma_alloc()
would return cma_chunk structure rather then dma_addr_t.

It's meant to be used by drivers even though the idea is that most drivers will
stick to the API above.

Not sure what you mean.

I'm not sure how resources.c could be reused.  It puts resources in hierarchy
whereas CMA does not care about hierarchy that much plus has only two levels
(regions on top and then chunks allocated inside).

I dunno, I first created two header files but then decided to put everything
in one file.  I dunno if anything is gained by exporting a few functions to
a separate header.  I think it only complicates things.

True.

CMA defaults to n.

Why wouldn't it?  All it says is that this particular file can be distributed
under GPLv2 or GPLv3 (or any later if FSF decides to publish updated version).
There is no difference between licensing GPLv2/BSD and GPLv2/GPLv3+.

I haven't looked at bootmem in such perspective.  I'll add that to my TODO list.
On the other hand, however, it seems bootmem is passée so I'm not sure if it's a
good idea to integrate with it that much.
