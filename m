I have not followed this thread, so I don't know exactly your issue, but FYI I
have an MT9M131 (of which the driver should hopefully be close to the MT9P031's)
working on i.MX35 with Linux 3.4.

I have local changes for that adding support for all possible formats to
mx3_camera and its IPU. I still have to upgrade to the latest Linux and to
prepare patches before posting them. I won't be able to do that before a few
weeks. However, if someone needs it, I can share my local changeset as a global
patch.

Best regards,
Beno√Æt
