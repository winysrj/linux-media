Hi Folks <BR>
<BR>
I have mistakenly bought a Fusion HDTV DVB-T dual express (cx23885) as a re=
sult of misreading some other posts and sites. I was under the impression t=
hat it would work either from the current kernel source or using Chris Pasc=
oe's modules.&nbsp; Unfortunately I didn't realise that the American and Eu=
ro/Australian version were different. <BR>
<BR>
The kernel modules and those from the mercurial tree seems to get everythin=
g going, but when I try to tune it, it seems to only give "ATSC" tuning opt=
ions. (This seems ridiculous as it is the "Europe/Australia" model). I beli=
eve it must be recognising the card as the American model (confirmed on the=
 PC Board that it is the Aus/Euro model). There are no error messages e.t.c=
.. it just can't find a signal and only gives ATSC tuning options. <BR>
 <BR>
Chris had offered to take a look at what was going on in my system but hasn=
't responded to any mails for a few weeks now and I can't see any evidence =
of him doing anything, so I am assuming he is too busy for the moment to ta=
ke a look. <BR>
<BR>
I bought this as a second and third tuner for my mythtv/gaming system . The=
 system already has a Fusion Lite card in it which is working very well.&nb=
sp; The importance of this was highlighted when I missed the Henry Rollins =
interview on Rove so my gf could watch Grey's Anatomy (puke!!!). <BR>
<BR>
If there are any local developers (Melbourne, Australia or even elsewhere i=
n Australia)&nbsp; then I would be happy to trade it with a confirmed worki=
ng dual tuner card on a temporary basis to enable the driver to be complete=
d/ amended to cope with the Australian/European version of the card. <BR>
<BR>
Otherwise for any developers not in Australia,I can setup a login for you (=
ssh only, no remote X or anything). Just contact me via aklinbail at gmail.=
&nbsp; The PC it sits on is our one and only TV tuner (our analog signal is=
 crap) so there are some limitations as to the times you can login to the b=
ox and also with regards to keeping the current kernel build in place so we=
 can use it on our return home from work in the evening. <BR>
<BR>
cheers <BR>
