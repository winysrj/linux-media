Dear Tomi,

This was on 3.10 from Laurent's board/beagle/mt9p031 branch. I am in the 
middle of doing some "bisecting" to figure out some unrelated problems 
with omap3isp so in a couple days I may have more data about which 
versions work and which do not.

Laurent's live application is using the V4L2 API for video output (to 
get free YUV conversion and DMA) so I guess this unfortunatelly counts 
as using omap_vout. Are there any alternatives I should look into? IIUC 
to use omapfb I would need to manually copy RGB data into the 
framebuffer on each frame.
