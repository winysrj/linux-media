Is that Káº‚orld device dual model (I guess yes, because of it9137)? Is it 
version 1 (AX) or version 2 (BX) chip?

If it is dual with version 1 chips, it is similar than that:
http://blog.palosaari.fi/2013/06/naked-hardware-9-terratec-cinergy-t.html

I suspect firmware is same for both it9135 or it9137 and only difference 
between chips is pins to connect slave demodulator.

Maybe difference is just firmware version and it is likely older (as I 
extracted one it9135 ver. 1 fw from latest windows driver). Have to 
check that.

Antti
