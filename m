> This is where the fun ended.  I banged my head on VLC, MythTV, me-tv, tvtime, vdr and others to no avail.  A little digging in the lists seemed to suggest I might be able to bring in over the air stations.  But my hope is to bring in analog NTSC cable channels and (gasp), possibly even Clear QAM HD channels.  Is there any hope or current effort to get analog NTSC working on this dongle?  Also, are there any USB dongles which support HD Clear QAM?  While I am primarily interested in analog NTSC (yeah, I hear ya, shoulda bought an HVR-950), getting analog and Clear QAM HD would be great.  While I would love to get my HVR-950Q working, I would settle for another well supported USB dongle with at least analog cable support that in known to work well with MythTV.

NTSC is not supported.

The 950Q works well with MythTV for ATSC and ClearQAM. I suggest you google or 
read the wikis at linuxtv.org. You might also want to check on linux support for 
any new product before purchasing and 'banging your head'.
