Nice job!

I have some minor comments on each patch, but also I don't agree
with the patch splitting: what's the point in splitting and sending
one patch per file?

It doesn't make it any easier to review, so why don't you just
send one patch: "Introduce smi2021 driver"?

The rule is one patch per change, and I believe this whole patchset
is just one change: adding a new driver.
