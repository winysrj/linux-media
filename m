Ok, but others on reading this thread may misunderstand the meanings.

I'm fine if you call it as an extension, but the original NEC _is_
16 bits, and most drivers are compliant with it.

We should not break what's working.

Well, if all drivers but one only have 16 or 24 bits tables, this is
an exception.

That's messy. We should either change everything in Kernelspace to
32 bits or keep as is.

If such emulation is needed, it should be only for userspace tables.

If I let this pass, we should revert it before it reaches upstream.

What patch caused regressions?

On the devices I have here, it is not broken. Let's fix it where this
is broken, and not use it as an excuse to break even more things.

Yes. That's one of the reasons why this was not fixed yet (and the other
one is that I don't have any of such device in hands, in order to be
sure that this is not another vendor that, by coincidence, has address
0x6b86).

It should be consistent, and it should be able to support the existing
hardware.

I think you're meaning 0x0000ffff, right?

Yes, we could do it, but the current userspace should keep working.
Eventually, that means to add some backward compat code there, in order
to preserve the behavior with current tables.
