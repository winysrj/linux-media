Subject: cx18, HVR-1600 Clear qam tuning

What is the status of clear qam tuning with the HVR-1600?

I've got me card setup and working, analog captures work well with
cable, and ATSC tuning of ota signals work great with an antenna, but
I can't find any clear qam cable stations.

I have a FusionHTDV5 usb tuner which finds 336 stations using qam256,
so I know that they are there, and the cable signal is good.

The HVR-1600 is even working with clear qam in Windows7... and has a
SNR of around 30 dB.
