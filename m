Subject: [PATCH v5 12/12] media: imx.rst: Update doc to reflect fixes to interlaced capture

Also add an example pipeline for unconverted capture with interweave
on SabreAuto.

Cleanup some language in various places in the process.

Changes since v4:
- Make clear that it is IDMAC channel that does pixel reordering and
  interweave, not the CSI. Caught by Philipp Zabel.
Changes since v3:
- none.
Changes since v2:
- expand on idmac interweave behavior in CSI subdev.
- switch second SabreAuto pipeline example to PAL to give
  both NTSC and PAL examples.
- Cleanup some language in various places.
