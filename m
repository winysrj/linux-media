It seems that you're using some game console to generate images.
Those usually output video in progressive mode, instead of using
interlaced mode. Maybe that's the cause of the issues you're
having.

You could try to write a quick hack by patching em28xx_v4l2_init, at 
drivers/media/usb/em28xx/em28xx-video.c.

Seek for those lines:

        if (dev->board.is_webcam)
                v4l2->progressive = true;

And comment the first one. If this works, then we may add a modprobe
parameter (like saa7134) or something else to fix it.

Thanks,
Mauro
