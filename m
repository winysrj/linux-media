I didn't want to say that it is easy to know the right interface. It is 
definitely not.
But I think we could do it better than we currently do.

Anyway, it seems there is no interest in such a patch.
Thanks for you explanations.

Isn't it also possible that we don't know the right interface and it is 
not interface 0 ? ;-)
