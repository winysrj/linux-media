Hello,

I'm trying to create a bitmap image such that when output via a
composite port it will translate into captions, very similar to this:
http://al.robotfuzz.com/generating-teletext-in-software/ except NTSC.
I have some ideas but wanted to check if anyone had tried something
similar as Google didn't turn up much, thanks!
