Ok, although it will only be allocated for MIGRATE_CMA-compatible
requests so it is not a disaster.

This will allocate the page from a pageblock we are trying to isolate
pages from, but only for a movable page that can still be migrated. It
does mean that CMA is doing more work than it should of course and
the problem also impacts memory hot-remove. It's worse for memory
hot-remove because potentially an UNMOVABLE page was allocated from
a MIGRATE_ISOLATE pageblock.

Ok, it's crazy but the problem is there.

Ok, thanks for persisting with this.
