The idea was to create a tsn-driver and then allow userspace to use it=20
either for media or for whatever else they'd like - and then a socket made=
=20
sense. Or so I thought :)

What is the rationale for no new sockets? To avoid cluttering? or do=20
sockets have a drawback I'm not aware of?

So something thin that is placed between to subystems should rather be=20
called.. flimsy? The point of the name was to indicate that it glued 2=20
pieces together. If you have a better suggestion, I'm all ears.

I'm not aware of any such discussions, could you point me to where TSN has=
=20
been discussed, it would be nice to see other peoples thought on the matter=
=20
(which was one of the ideas behind this series in the first place)

Well, in all honesty, I did say so :) It is marked as "very-RFC", and not=
=20
for being included in the kernel as-is. I also made a short list of the=20
most crucial bits missing.

I know there are real issues, but solving these won't matter if you don't=
=20
have anything useful to do with it. I decided to start by adding a thin=20
ALSA-driver and then continue to work with the kernel infrastructure.=20
Having something that works-ish makes it a lot easier to test and get=20
others interested in, especially when you are not deeply involved in a=20
subsystem.

At one point you get to where you need input from other more intimate with=
=20
then inner workings of the different subsystems to see how things should be=
=20
created without making too much of a mess. So where we are :)

My primary motivation was to
a) gather feedback (which you have provided, and for which I am very=20
   grateful)
b) get the discussion going on how/if TSN should be added to the kernel

Why is configfs wrong?

Unless you want to implement discovery and enumeration and srp-negotiation=
=20
in the kernel, you need userspace to handle this. Once userspace has done=
=20
all that (found priority-codes, streamIDs, vlanIDs and all the required=20
bits), then userspace can create a new link. For that I find ConfigFS to be=
=20
quite useful and up to the task.

In my opinion, it also makes for a much tidier and saner interface than=20
some obscure dark-magic ioctl()

I surely hope so, but as I'm not deep into the networking part of the=20
kernel finding those appropriate extensions is hard - which is why we=20
started writing a standalone module-

At one stage, data has to flow in/out of the network, and whoever's using=
=20
TSN probably need to store data somewhere as well, so you need some form of=
=20
buffering at one place in the path the data flows through.

That being said, one of the bits on my plate is to remove the=20
"TSN-hosted-buffer" and let TSN read/write data via the shim_ops. What the=
=20
best set of functions where are, remain to be seen, but it should provide a=
=20
way to move data from either a single frame or a "few frames" to the shime=

(err.. <descriptive word for a thin layer slapped between 2 largers=20

Yes, or a ALSA-driver capable of same task. But yes, you need a way to=20
propagate the presentation-time (and maybe a timestamp for when a frame was=
=20
received) to the final destination of the samples. As far as I've been able=
=20
to tell, this is not possible in the kernel at the moment.

Yes, I thought so, which is also why I have put that to the side and why=20
I'm using ktime_get() for timestamps at the moment. There's also the issue=
=20
of hooking the time into ALSA/V4L2

yes, I've noticed. I've refered to an imaginary 'tsnctl' in the code, which=
=20
is supposed to be a "userspace catch-all for TSN-housekeeping". You=20
probably need a tsnd or similar as well to send keepalive frames etc.

Why? the whole point should be to make it as easy for userspace as=20
possible. If you need to tailor each individual media-appliation to use=20
AVB, it is not going to be very useful outside pro-Audio. Sure, there will=
=20
be challenges, but one key element here should be to *not* require=20
upgrading every single media application.

Then, back to the suggestion of adding a TSN_SOCKET (which you didn't like,=
=20
but can we agree on a term "raw interface to TSN", and mode of transport=20
can be defined later? ), was to let those applications that are TSN-aware=
=20
to do what they need to do, whether it is controlling robots or media=20
streams.

Ah, I was unaware of this, both CMESG and mmap buffers.

What is the accuracy of deferred transmit? If you have a class A stream,=20
you push out a new frame every 125 us, you may end up with=20
accuracy-constraints lower than that if you want to be able to state "send=

Yes, that would be very nice, and something like that is the ultimate goal=

of the netdev_ops I added, even though it is a far way away from that now.

Yes, this is something missing that must be adressed. And yes, I know=20

Well, the hard-coded audio format you refer to is placed with the avb_alsa=

shim, avtp_du is part of the actual TSN-header so that is not audio-only.=
=20
And yes, it must be separated.
