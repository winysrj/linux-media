Hi,

have started to mess around with a not yet supported saa7134_empress
hybrid device.

I have anything going, except the mpeg encoder.

Last track of having it working seems 2.4.18, but I get even EIO stuff
on trying to read from the device there, but that might be device
specific. At least it has two gpio switchers not seen before, but the
whole stuff seems not to be that well documented ...

Current stuff is definitely broken,
any known last working status out there?

Cheers,
Hermann
