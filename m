The problem lies in the easy to use applications and UI being married to 
analog. The Linux digital applications are "build it yourself" like ham 
radio, while the Windows applications are like CB, plug and works. I 
have been trying for months to find any solution for a group of office 
workers who are trying to move off Fedora FC4 and FC6 (tvtime and mostly 
xawtv) and old Windows to new desktop, preferably FC11. I support their 
Linux servers, I am helping find a desktop solution because I believe in 
Linux (ie. I'm donating my time and the price of cards I bought for 
testing).

Their install "support" guy will plug cards in the box, or USB adaptors, 
and install an RPM. He won't install a bunch of RPMs, configure a 
database, and play dba to get mythtv working. The users understand 
selecting transport like digital-cable-us, analog-braodcast-us, S-video, 
and channels. They are not going to look up frequencies, build channel 
tables, of type transponder frequencies in kHz into vlc and similar. So 
if I could find a commercial solution for them, which they could install 
and run with minimal problem, I'd be happy. I like open source, I have 
supported open source back to stuff I wrote on MULTICS, but sometimes 
"working now" solutions are needed, not "help with development." And 
putting a bunch of partial solutions together is fine for Lego or 
Erector sets, not so much for office working wanting to install and use 
an intuitive solution.

Is this list to promote video on Linux, or just some particular 
implementation of it? Is there a better list, where all competing 
hardware and software can be discussed as solutions without people 
getting flamed? I don't want to offend by talking about the wrong 
hardware brand, or software which can be used by a ten year old, but 
those are the kinds of Q&A I thought I'd find here.

  Unintended results are the well-earned reward for incompetence.
