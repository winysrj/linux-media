Ah.  Grand.  Thanks...

Btw. The documentation for clk_get() really should include some of
this information.  I know Russell thinks that the driver authors are
stupid and lazy, and it's probably true.  But if everyone makes the
same mistake over and over, then it probably means we could put a
special note:

"Do not check this with IS_ERR_OR_NULL().  Null values are not an
error.  Drivers should treat the return value as an opaque cookie
and they should not dereference it."

This is probably there in the file somewhere else, but I searched
for "opaque", "cookie", and "dereference" and I didn't find
anything.  I'm not saying the documentation isn't perfect, just that
driver authors are lazy and stupid but we can't kill them so we have
to live with them.
