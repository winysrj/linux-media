Thanks. I'll reply separately to that thread.

Looks good to me.

This part requires a more detailed description of the problem area. What 
makes a difference here is that there's a pipeline this pipeline may be 
controlled more than one driver. (More elaborate discussion below.)

I would agree with the above statement *if* we had no devices that 
require doing this in a different way.

Consider the following case:

	sensor   -> CSI-2 receiver -> ISP (DMA)
	subdev A -> subdev B	   -> video node

Assume that the CSI-2 receiver requires hardware setup both *before and 
after* streaming has been enabled on the sensor.

In previous cases the CSI-2 receiver and the ISP have been part of the 
same device. This is not universally the case anymore. You'll also get 
the same when you add adv748x to the pipeline, and the upstream device 
in the pipeline before the adv748x is represented as a sub-device (and 
is thus controlled by its sub-device driver).

This is addressable by moving the control of the upstream sub-device 
streaming state to the driver which is next to it, and what the patch 
also documents. Note that there is no difference if you have a 
sub-device without sink pads (or in general case, a sub-device that only 
has one kind of pads).

What comes to compatibility between MC-centric and devnode-centric 
drivers --- on an MC-centric device you have a pipeline and you 
typically have multiple pads on the sub-devices along the pipeline. 
Drivers that are devnode-centric generally aren't aware of pads, and so 
cannot configure sub-devices with multiple pads to begin with.

You could do that in principle, but you'll start running into the same 
problems which were addressed by introducing the Media controller interface.

Note that this is not a commonplace. The difference will be only be 
there *if and only if* you have a sub-device with sink pads in a 
pipeline. There are not many of those, and that difference is not 
introduced by this patch: it is a property of hardware.

I'm definitely open to improving the wording as well as other solutions 
that can address this.
