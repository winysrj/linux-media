Hello,

I presume this is about the other thread, right? I didn't mark the whole
TT as a bad company, at least I didn't intend to do so. We were talking
about a single product, or to be more precise, maturity of its Linux
support. If I didn't like TT as a whole, I wouldn't have written the
last email (in that thread)... :) The company info was just a summation
of their press releases, which no doubt is relevant for this list.
AFAIK, it hasn't been mentioned yet. We'll see how the situation
develops, I'm just as curious as others. It could even be good news for us.

This is actually quite simple - the problem is that Manu here drags
irrelevant stuff into arguments just so he can be "be right" (about
these *irrelevant* facts of his choosing), every time he is proven wrong
on the issue at hand. This way all discussions would be endless,
snowballing new and new aspects without any relation to the original
issue. Let's sum it up:

A) I recommended Mystique: it's supported and has the features OP
wanted. I said it was *similar* to the popular & well known KNC1+ (*it
is* similar: it's a lighter version, same as KNC1)
B) Manu joined in, blabbering that Mystique is not similar, but
identical to _KNC1+_ (just, you know, "to correct" me). That is *not
true*, however. It's a KNC1 clone, not KNC1+.
A) I've seen this mistake several times, so I explained the differences
of the lighter Mystique (and - in effect - of the plain KNC1) for OP's sake.
B) When he saw his mistake ("The Mystique is just a rebranded _KNC1+_"),
he dragged in irrelevant facts: the driver and descriptions of all
variants of this card -- just so he could say something he's "right"
about. By doing that, he implies I was disagreeing with it, but how
could I - he just dragged it in. You see how it works? This is the most
effective troll technique, because it generates infinite arguments
drifting farther and farther away from the real issue. People can't
usually restrain themselves and they carry on spamming.

It is possible his erroneous statement ("The Mystique is just a
rebranded KNC1+") was just a typo and he meant plain KNC1, but he should
have said so and corrected himself. Instead, he started a flame to cover
it by making *me* the one who made a mistake. I know about his work,
indeed I always wish him luck, but I will have none of this. Being a
developer doesn't give him the right to insult people to hide his own
mistakes. Most of us here are developers and nobody gets a special
treatment in discussions.

Let's not fuel this nonsense any more... In short, Manu was wrong and I
was right. ;o)

See you around, mate
