So that's just another evdev interface bug.

Yeah, there's some confusion there.

The "unknown ioctl" error code is (for traditional reasons) ENOTTY,
but yes, the EINVAL thing admittedly has a lot of legacy use too.

Inside the kernel, the preferred way to say "I don't recognize that
ioctl number" is actually ENOIOCTLCMD.  That's exactly so that various
nested ioctl handlers can then tell the difference between "I didn't
recognize that ioctl" and "I understand what you asked me to do, but
your arguments were crap".

vfs_ioctl() will then turn ENOIOCTLCMD to EINVAL to return to user space.
