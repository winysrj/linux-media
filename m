Hi Scott,

Although I was on holiday but couldn't resist myself from working,
since I was away from my hardware I had to choose a different one,
blackfin driver was lucky one. Since I don't have the blackfin
board I haven't tested them on the actual board, but just compile
tested, Can you please test it & ACK.
