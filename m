In some ways, yes, I can see that this seems like one thing "Make
go7007 work correctly", but really it would be better if each of
the bullet points was its own patch.

The changelogs should explain why you do something not what you do.
We can all see that kmalloc() was changed to kzalloc() but why? Is
their and information leak for example?  That might have security
implications and be good thing to know about.
