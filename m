Hi,

i have a development computer with a Tevii S480 connected to a Satellite channel
router (EN50494). As long as I haven't started a video application this
computers blocks any other receiver connected to this cable. I have measured the
output of the Tevii card and found, that after start of the computer, the output
is set to 18V. This is not reset after loading and initializing the drivers. So
no other receiver could sent DiSEqC commands to the SCR until
a video application at this computer initializes the voltage correctly. I think
the voltage needs to be switched off until this card is really in use by an
application.

I have patched the file drivers/media/dvb-frontends/ds3000.c to initialize the
voltage to OFF, which works for me. But I am not sure, if this is really the
correct solution:
