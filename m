Did you try it with Allwinner SoCs?

No. I only tested with a BT1120 signal generated by FPGA or ADV7611. HSYNC
and VSYNC are not used.

For V3s CSI driver, I will add the following to dt-bindings:
Endpoint node properties for CSI1
---------------------------------

- remote-endpoint      : (required) a phandle to the bus receiver's endpoint
                          node
- bus-width:           : (required) must be 8, 10, 12 or 16
- pclk-sample          : (optional) (default: sample on falling edge)
- hsync-active         : (only required for parallel)
- vsync-active         : (only required for parallel)

You could try diffrent hsync-active/vsync-active values here.
