To give some background here: While I did a lot of changes to the
compat ioctl code over the years, I never touched the EINVAL/ENOTTY
logic out of fear of breaking things further. Your patch is probably
the right answer here and we should have done it long ago.

Now this behavior was entirely intentional. ENOIOCTLCMD was introduced
explicitly so we could tell the difference between compat_ioctl handlers
saying "I don't know how to translate this but common code might know"
(ENOIOCTLCMD) and "I know that this is not a valid command code here"
(ENOTTY plus whatever a broken driver might return).

The distinction is used in two places:

1. To let device drivers return early from fops->compat_ioctl when
they want to avoid the overhead from searching the COMPATIBLE_IOCTL()
table and from the (formerly large) switch statement in do_ioctl_trans(),
or when they want to make sure that the common translation is not
called. We have some really tricky bits in the socket code where
the crazy SIOCDEVPRIVATE needs to be handled specially by some drivers
while the majority can use the default siocdevprivate_ioctl() function.

2. To return from do_ioctl_trans() when we know that there is no
translation for the command number, so that the we can write a warning
to the console (which you have now removed). This was initially more
useful back when do_ioctl_trans() knew about practically all command
numbers, but we have gradually moved all handlers into device drivers
where they belong, and that has caused the problem that we get warnings
whenever a user attempts an ioctl on a device that does not handle the
command even when all the correct devices that support the command also
have a compat handler. The common way we handle those is to add an
IGNORE_IOCTL() entry for a command that repeatedly shows up in logs
that way and is known to be handled correctly.

I used to have patches to completely remove the remains of do_ioctl_trans()
that can be resurrected if that helps, but it's mostly an independent
issue.

While I agree that the existing compat_ioctl_error() method was somewhat
broken, I'd like to keep having a way to get some indication from
drivers that are missing ioctl translations. Ideally, we would move
all of fs/compat_ioctl.c into drivers and then just warn when we register
some file_operations on a 64 bit machine that have an ioctl but no
compat_ioctl function, but that would be a large amount of work.

For a simpler solution, we could keep the old warning message, but change
the logic from

(.compat_ioctl == NULL || .compat_ioctl() == -ENOIOCTL) && (no generic handler)

to

(.ioctl != NULL && .compat_ioctl == NULL) && (no generic handler).

and then fix the warnings we see by adding appropriate .compat_ioctl
functions.
