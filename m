Just some preliminary feedback after two weeks of testing. 

So far the problem with multiple rc_core devices fighting over the same 
sysfs file hasn't occured again, but it's a bit too early to be 
completely sure about it (probably 4-5 more weeks before I can be 
(relatively) confident that the problem is really gone). 

With this patch applied, everything continues to work fine for me; I 
haven't noticed any problems.

Thanks a lot
