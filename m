That isn't a very helpful answer to his problem, is it?
He might have wanted any reply, but trying to be friendly wouldn't have =

killed you.

I'll give this a go:

There is a way, called "cardsharing", to decode multiple streams with 1 cam.
Do note, however, that some people think this is illegal, but that's =

because cardsharing has a bad name. There are people who perform this =

"cardsharing" with other people over the internet, which IS illegal.

Because of this most people don't want us to talk about *any *kind of =

cardsharing, just to be on the safe side.
I can follow their reasoning but it still resembles some kind of =

illogical censor which we should not tollerate!
But I digress ...

Because this local cardsharing is not illegal (at least not where I'm =

from), some set top boxes you buy in the store also have multiple =

(working) tuners, so they perform some kind of internal cardsharing as well.

Please correct me if I'm wrong or being ignorant ...
