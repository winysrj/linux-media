It is already used, for cases when consumer device has a DT node attached. 
In non-DT case this kind lookup translates loosely to something that is 
being done in regulator framework - you can't bind devices by pointers, 
because you don't have those pointers, so you need to use device names.

There is no platform data when booting with DT.

Sure. It's good to have different options discussed as well.
