Shouldn't this be 'renesas,sync-active' instead of syncac-active?

I'm not sure if syncac is intended or if it is a typo.

Other than sync-active, is there really anything else that is similar? And
even the sync-active isn't a good fit since here there is only one sync
signal instead of two for video (h and vsync).
