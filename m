Subject: [PATCH] V4L/DVB: budget-av: wait longer for frontend to power on
Date: Sun, 21 Mar 2010 20:46:27 +0100

Some devices need much more time than 100ms to power on, leading to a
failure to enable the frontend on the first attempt. Instead we get

[   40.764067] budget-av: A frontend driver was not found for device [1131:7146] subsystem [1894:0022]

Unloading and the reloading the driver will work around this problem.  But
it can also be easily fixed by increasing the wait period after powering
on.  The optimum value is unclear to me.  But I've found the 500 ms is not
enough.  5 s is enough for my card, but might be more than actually needed.
However, as long as we don't handle this failure more gracefully, then the
timeout need to be long enough.

Hello,

I have recently bought a KNC1 clone, called Mystique CaBiX-C2.  This card 
would just not work on reboot in my system, giving the errors shown above.
Unloading the module and then loading it again always fixed the problem,
indicating that it was just a startup timing problem.

As you can see, the i2c timeouts are from the frontend attach function, 
tda10023_attach():
	/* wakeup if in standby */
	tda10023_writereg (state, 0x00, 0x33);
	/* check if the demod is there */
	if ((tda10023_readreg(state, 0x1a) & 0xf0) != 0x70) goto error;

cleary showing that it just isn't responding yet at that point.

I first tried increasing the msleep() to 500 ms, but still got the same
error.  Increasing it to 5000 ms helped, however, and made my card work
from boot.  I have not tried any values inbetween, as each attempt AFAIK
requires a reboot to get the card into the "cold state" where it will
fail.

dmesg with the patch installed:

[   43.851587] budget-av: ci interface initialised.

Please consider this patch.  Or maybe it is possible to wait smarter,
testing actual frontend power status instead of just a blind sleep?

I've also included a CC stable as I've had the same problem with the 2.6.32
and 2.6.33 stable drivers.
