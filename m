No, this is not true; git pull requests are typically handled faster, as
the material there is submitted either by a driver maintainer or by a
sub-maintainer. The delay there for -git is currently 2 weeks, as we closed our
merge window at the beginning of -rc7 (expecting that there won't be a -rc8).

The very large of individual patches have a longer delays, due to the lack of
driver maintainers reviews.

Yeah, the issue is that both reviewed, non-reviewed and rejected/commented
patches go into the very same queue, forcing me to revisit each patch again, 
even the rejected/commented ones, and the previous versions of newer patches.

By giving rights and responsibilities to the sub-maintainers to manage their
stuff directly at patchwork, those patches that tend to stay at patchwork for
a long time will likely disappear, and the queue will be cleaner.
