I think that [io_]remap_pfn_range() calls are used by the oldest drivers
and a few newer ones that based on some old cut-and-paste code.

Let me see what drivers use it on media...

	$ git grep -l remap_pfn_range drivers/media/
	drivers/media/pci/meye/meye.c
	drivers/media/pci/zoran/zoran_driver.c
	drivers/media/platform/omap/omap_vout.c
	drivers/media/platform/omap24xxcam.c
	drivers/media/platform/vino.c
	drivers/media/usb/cpia2/cpia2_core.c
	drivers/media/v4l2-core/videobuf-dma-contig.c

Yes, meye, vino, cpia2 and zoran are very old drivers. I only have
here somewhere zoran cards. I'll see if they still work, and write
a patch for it.

The platform drivers that use remap_pfn_range() are omap2 and vino.
Vino is for SGI Indy machines. I dunno anyone with those hardware
and a camera anymore. The OMAP2 were used on some Nokia phones.
They used to maintain that code, but now that they moved to the dark
side of the moon, they lost their interests on it. So, it may not 
be easily find testers for patches there.

The videobuf-dma-contig code actually uses two implementations there: 
one using vm_insert_page() for cached memory, and another one using 
remap_pfn_range() for uncached memory.

All places where cached memory is used got already moved to 
videobuf2-dma-contig. We can simply drop that unused code from it, 
and remap_pfn_range() by vm_iomap_memory(). 

I can write the patches doing it, but I don't any hardware here
using videobuf-dma-contig for testing. So, I'll post it
asking people to test.
