I like the idea in general, this makes things much simpler.

There is at least one issue with your current implementation though.
"make oldconfig" has this to complain about:

drivers/mfd/Kconfig:5:error: recursive dependency detected!
drivers/mfd/Kconfig:5:	symbol MFD_CORE is selected by OLPC_XO1_PM
arch/x86/Kconfig:2028:	symbol OLPC_XO1_PM depends on MFD_CS5535
drivers/mfd/Kconfig:613:	symbol MFD_CS5535 depends on MFD_CORE

Not sure if it is really caused by your patch or only revealed by it,
but it should be fixed anyway. The following should fix it, please
consider folding in your patch:

Samuel Ortiz is the maintainer of the mfd subsystem, so his tree would
be an obvious choice.

I can't test it either, but it looks sane to me. If you merge the
proposed changes above, you can add:
