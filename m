Indeed, it's a fork, 100% identical:


static int em28xx_get_key_terratec(struct IR_i2c *ir, u32 *ir_key, u32
*ir_raw)
{
    unsigned char b;

    /* poll IR chip */
    if (1 != i2c_master_recv(ir->c, &b, 1)) {
        i2cdprintk("read error\n");
        return -EIO;
    }

    /* it seems that 0xFE indicates that a button is still hold
       down, while 0xff indicates that no button is hold
       down. 0xfe sequences are sometimes interrupted by 0xFF */

    i2cdprintk("key %02x\n", b);

    if (b == 0xff)
        return 0;

    if (b == 0xfe)
        /* keep old data */
        return 1;

    *ir_key = b;
    *ir_raw = b;
    return 1;
}




static int get_key_knc1(struct IR_i2c *ir, u32 *ir_key, u32 *ir_raw)
{
    unsigned char b;

    /* poll IR chip */
    if (1 != i2c_master_recv(ir->c, &b, 1)) {
        dprintk(1,"read error\n");
        return -EIO;
    }

    /* it seems that 0xFE indicates that a button is still hold
       down, while 0xff indicates that no button is hold
       down. 0xfe sequences are sometimes interrupted by 0xFF */

    dprintk(2,"key %02x\n", b);

    if (b == 0xff)
        return 0;

    if (b == 0xfe)
        /* keep old data */
        return 1;

    *ir_key = b;
    *ir_raw = b;
    return 1;
}



Why should we keep two 100% identical functions ? See patch 4/6.
I'm 99% sure that both devices are absolutely identical.

Concerning the fix I'm suggesting here:
First of all, I have to say that the Terratec RC works even without this
patch.
Nevertheless, I think the function should really return valid values for
ir_key and ir_raw when 0xfe=button hold is received. Especially because
the function succeeds.
This also allows us to make u32 ir_key, ir_raw in ir_key_poll() in
ir-kbd-i2c.c non-static.
While I agree that we should be careful, I can't see how this can cause
any trouble.

The second thing is the small fix for the key code debug output. Don't
you think it makes sense ?

Regards,
Frank
