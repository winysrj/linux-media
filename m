In my case the machine in question is an ARMv5, the hardware restriction
is on ARMv6+ only.  You could argue that so the breaking patch for arm
should only break ARMv6, but I don't think this is sensible from a
maintainers POV.  We need an API that works independant of the machine
that runs the code.  And it's good to let developers that don't have the full
range of machines supported by the kernel at hand notice when they
introduce an incompatibility.

Best regards
Uwe
