I've been searching for a PCI-e device with an MPEG-2 hardware encoder 
for analogue input for months, there's nothing on the market with linux 
support.

There are a few h.264 encoders, mainly aimed at CCTV applications, but 
they're no good for me.

Analogue encoding support on the HVR devices seems the only likely 
solution but it won't happen any time soon it seems.

If you find anything, please post details!

Thanks,

Lou
