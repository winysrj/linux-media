I don't doubt it.

But holding the members of a whole community as captives over several
years is a even much more severe issue.

Alone for reading the thousands of mails, how can I build the f*, there
is no compensation and that alone is a reason to have serious doubts
about such kind of support or keep that out of linuxtv too.

To accuse Steve now, his major captive, of something, Manu is far away
to even come close to be allowed to do such, if you look at it in whole,
is a further proof, that it will never end until he has v4l-dvb :)

This would cure him immediately in that direction and I seriously
suggested it.

The underlying problem is deeper, you can't allow something important,
like S2 HDTV support on GNU/Linux, to be in the hand of a single
developer and related NDAs.

The guy might be as fine like Manu, but what comes down to him from all
sides behind the scenes will make even the best soon uncomfortable and
others scratch their had, damned, why he always bites and would this
ever end?

In between others spend their time tracking down some old issue someone
is coming back with after years, but on that shiny new driver this will
of course never happen again ...

Cheers,
Hermann
