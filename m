Russell, Tony,

Sorry for getting back to this old thread, but since my previous 
attempts to provide[1] or support[2] a possibly better solution to the 
problem all failed on one hand, and I can see patches not very different 
from mine[3] being accepted for arch/arm/mach-{mx3,imx} during this and 
previous merge windows[4][5][6] on the other, is there any chance for the 
'dma_declare_coherent_memory() over a memblock_alloc()->free()->remove() 
obtained area' based solution being accepted for omap1_camera as well if 
I resend it refreshed?

BTW, commit 6d3163ce86dd386b4f7bda80241d7fea2bc0bb1d, "mm: check if any 
page in a pageblock is reserved before marking it MIGRATE_RESERVE", 
almost corrected the problem for me, allowing for very stable device 
operation in videobuf_dma_contig mode once all resident programs get 
settled up and no unusual activity happens, but this is still not 100% 
reliable, so I think that only using a kind of memory area reservered 
during boot for the purpose can be considered as free of transient 
-ENOMEM issues.

Thanks,
Janusz
