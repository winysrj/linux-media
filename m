That shared DVB / V4L2 tuner is one problem that I have also currently 
(SDR is on V4L2 API and DTV is provided via DVB API). I have decided to 
try model where I separate RF tuner totally independent used DVB / V4L2 
APIs, just to plain I2C driver model. Idea is here to provide needed set 
of general callbacks and communication and device binding is done via 
I2C driver model.
I am not sure though if there is any big caveats I haven't realized yet...

Antti
