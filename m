Yes, that looks fine.

Yes, the CSI on i.MX6 does not deal well with unstable bt.656 sync codes,
which results in vertical sync issues (scrolling or split images). The 
ADV7180
will often shift the sync codes around in various situations (initial 
power on,
see below, also when there is an interruption of the input analog CVBS
signal).

There is a frame interval monitor in the imx-media driver that can catch 
these
unstable sync code events and send an v4l2 event to userspace, userspace can
then issue stream off->on which usually corrects the vertical sync.

See https://linuxtv.org/downloads/v4l-dvb-apis/v4l-drivers/imx.html, section
15.9 for more info on the vertical sync issues in i.MX6 CSI and how to setup
the FIM to correct them.

One other thing I've noticed is that the ADV7180 can send unstable bt.656
sync codes after initial power on. Try adding a ~10 frame time delay in
adv7180_set_power(), so that the imx CSI won't see these frames and
get tripped up at stream on.

The old driver, IIRC, would also catch the unstable sync codes via
a FIM, but would internally restart IPU capture hardware without
the involvement of userspace, effectively this was an internal
stream on/off. In imx-media, this must be done via userspace when
it catches the V4L2_EVENT_IMX_FRAME_INTERVAL_ERROR event.
