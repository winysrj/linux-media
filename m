Fine with me. I actually tried to come up with a name that implies that the
symbol is actually "inline" (or even __always_inline_ without KASAN, but
couldn't think of any good name for it.

Would KMSAN also force local variables to be non-overlapping the way that
asan-stack=1 and -fsanitize-address-use-after-scope do? As I understood it,
KMSAN would add extra code for maintaining the uninit bits, but in an example
like this

int f(int *);
static inline __attribute__((always_inline)) int g(void)
{
    int i;
    f(&i);
    return i;
}
int f(void)
{
     return g()+g()+g()+g();
}

each of the four copies of 'i' could have the same location on the stack
and get marked uninitialized again before calling f(). We only need
noinline_for_kasan (whatever we end up calling that) for compiler
features that force each instance of 'i' to have its own stack redzone.
