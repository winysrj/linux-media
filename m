Hi Sebastien,

If you're targeting the ngene based cards, I think you will also need
the spec for the ngene chip and my guess is that it has been programmed
(not generic like the 3 other chips). So as Ralph is already in contact
with digital devices, I wonder if you will get this information.

For the cxd2099ar, talk to sony europe CXD2099_support<>eu./sony/.com
