I'll be there as an organizer and participant. We will also have Ricky
from our camera team in Taipei join via Hangouts.

To avoid wasting time on the day of the event, I'd like to have a full
list of participants with emails, so that I can arrange building
access. Replying "Yes, I'll be there" will work for me. ;)

Please let me know if you need any further details or help.

Best regards,
Tomasz
