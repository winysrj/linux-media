You need to understand and list the reasons why this driver cannot go
directly to mainline; missing functionality is usually not the
culprit.

Greg has mentioned that staging acceptance rules are:

1. Code compiles
2. Is self sustained (does not touch code out of staging)
3. Has a clear roadmap out of staging (that TODO file)
4. Is maintained

But I really think you should always prefer to upstream your code
directly to mainline. Submit the code, have it reviewed by the
relevant maintainers and upstream developers, and fix it appropriately
until it is accepted.

Only if you feel (/know) it would take substantial cleanup/redesign
efforts until it is accepted upstream, then staging is indeed the way
to go. But then you should know what gates it from upstream merger,
and focus on that (rather than on adding functionality) until it is
taken out of staging. IMHO adding functionality will just make it
harder for you to take it out of staging eventually. Usually the
opposite road is taken: first get a minimal driver accepted upstream,
and then gradually add the missing functionality.

Good luck,
Ohad.
