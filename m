I'm guessing that I wrote that ("forthcoming") a good while ago (year
and a half maybe?). At the time, MKrufky had realized digital support
for the device and was hoping to eventually add analog support. As I
said just the other day
(http://marc.info/?l=linux-video&m=122750104704023&w=2) I'm not sure of
current state of analog support development, though I suspect that it
simply slipped off the radar, despite best intentions otherwise.

You might want to take up the reigns on this one. I'm not sure how
difficult it will be. I believe either Hans Verkuil or Mike Isley has
been doing some recent work with the cx25843 decoder driver so you might
want check on that avenue too.
