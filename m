Hi guys,

This is just a little thing, I'm sorry for disturbing you with this. I'm just 
slightly confused because TechnoTrend TT-connect S2-3650 CI device is listed 
on wiki as supported device but when you go to product wiki page you get 
information that this is currently experimental and not supported. This 
information is most probably outdated ('This page was last modified on 27 
March 2011, at 12:26.'), but I'm looking for confirmation whether there will 
be no problems with this device before I will buy it. Could you please let me 
know? It's hard to find any evidence on this via Internet on my own.

Thank you very much and kind regards,
Konrad
