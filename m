I do have a question about this particular warning though. Weird
indentation that I had to use in order to calm checkpatch.pl about
that issue has been a topic of discussion and complaints once
already(see https://lkml.org/lkml/2012/9/21/67) To my understanding
the consensus was as far as it improves readability > 80 character
lines are OK. What would you like me do with those extra long lines
ignore all/fix all/use discretion and fix some?
