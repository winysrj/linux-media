The xilinx-spi, ocores-i2c, i2c-xiic drivers and to some extend the
ks8842 ethernet driver are generic IPs that the timberdale SOC happens to
use. So I agree it's extremely unlikely that anyone could come up with a
platform that would be re-using e.g. the timb-radio IP, but I think it's less
unikely for more generic IPs such as the xilinx-spi one.

I'm talking about reverting the default behaviour of passing the MFD cell as
the platform data, and going back to the cell definitions setting their
platform_data pointer explicitely. In that case, the cs5535 driver would have
to do something like:

diff --git a/drivers/mfd/cs5535-mfd.c b/drivers/mfd/cs5535-mfd.c
index 155fa04..3e3841d 100644
--- a/drivers/mfd/cs5535-mfd.c
+++ b/drivers/mfd/cs5535-mfd.c
@@ -106,6 +106,7 @@ static __devinitdata struct mfd_cell cs5535_mfd_cells[] =
{
                .name = "cs5535-acpi",
                .num_resources = 1,
                .resources = &cs5535_mfd_resources[ACPI_BAR],
+               .platform_data = &cs5535_mfd_cells[ACPI_BAR],
 
                .enable = cs5535_mfd_res_enable,
                .disable = cs5535_mfd_res_disable,

mfd_get_cell would then return &cs5535_mfd_cells[ACPI_BAR].

This fix would put all sub devices drivers back to an MFD agnostic state,
although the vast majority of them will certainly never be found anywhere else
than in their current MFD SoC. That's why I'm still not sure which way to go
to fix that problem.

Cheers,
Samuel.
