You don't need the hardware to check ... the question becomes is a
capabilities test sitting in the implementation or not.

Um, I'm not sure that's even an issue.  capabilities have CAP_ADMIN
which is precisely the same check as owner == root.  We use this a lot
because ioctls ignore the standard unix DAC model.
