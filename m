Thanks, but, why wasn't this done instead of c37db91f?

Will this make it in before 2.6.37 is released? Otherwise 2.6.37 will
need to be fixed in -stable immediatly after release.

Could you take this patch to remove all of the comments about locking
order with btv->lock since it doesn't seem to matter any longer.

Cheers,

	Brandon

P.S. Your mail client creates really long lines- somewhere around 90
characters. Could you fix that?

Subject: [PATCH] bttv: remove unneeded locking comments

After Mauro's "bttv: Fix locking issues due to BKL removal code" there
are a number of comments that are no longer needed about lock ordering.
Remove them.
