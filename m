As I've already pointed you, just send me a pull request from your tree when
you think it is ready. I'll be reviewing it after that. There are just too much
reviews on those drivers from TI for me to dig into every single version, especially
since, on most cases, I can't really contribute much, as I don't have OMAP3/Davinci
datasheets and the required devices here for testing, and that the reviews
come from someone at TI and/or one of your customers with a real test case
scenario.

So, as agreed in the past, I just mark all those drivers with RFC at patchwork
and I wait for the driver maintainer to send me a pull request, indicating me
that you've reached on a point where the driver/patch series is ready for its
addition.

So, if you think you're ready, you just need to send a pull request to the ML.
You don't even need to c/c me on that (and please avoid doing it, otherwise
I end by having multiple copies of your pull request, flooding my email with no
good reason).

Thanks,
Mauro
