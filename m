I think the suggestion for collapsing came about because, in this
patch series, the dvb and v4l use-cases are such that tuner and
audio need to be held together. i.e when tuner is held, audio is
held as well. With an intent to simplify the usage, I decided to
have get_tuner interface to return audio token. It does simplify
the logic for callers - all the paces that get tuner will also
need to make a call to get audio and handle errors when audio is
not available. That made it even more confusing perhaps and raised
the question that "why can't we collapse".

Having two tokens will allow the ability hold them independently.
Maybe the right approach for patch v3 is don't collapse, but
change dvb and v4l to get tuner followed by audio and handle the
errors paths themselves.
