I've had problems with getting input to work on this card.

Is there anything I can do with BTSpy or similar to get this card working.
I see that there are some commented out function calls in the bttv source.
Does anyone have access to the old information mentioned here:

http://www.mail-archive.com/video4linux-list@redhat.com/msg04291.html

It might give a clue as to how to get this card working.
Could btwincap also provide any other clues.

Any guidance would be appreciated

Regards,

Kieran Kunhya.
