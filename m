Not much time to do the actual coding and compiling but I will set you
up with :-)

I will get you a dedicated machine with ssh access you can play with as
much as you like, it will be up and running next week after Wednesday.

Have you ever heard of ssh gateways, I am kind of good at this I build
my support systems around this. So I will set you up with an account :D

Best regards,
