Hi,

This is a rewrite of the feature since v3, maybe it should have been 
posted as a new series?

This series enables incremental async find and bind of subdevices,
please se patch 3/3 for a more detailed description of the new behavior, 
changelog in this cover letter for the differences to v3. The two 
primary reasons for a new implementation where:

1. Hans expressed an interest having the async complete() callbacks to 
   happen only once all notifiers in the pipeline where complete. To do 
   this a stronger connection between the notifiers where needed, hence 
   the subnotifier is now embedded in struct v4l2_subdev.

   Whit this change it is possible to check all notifiers in a pipeline 
   is complete before calling any of them.

2. There where concerns that the v3 solution was a bit to complex and 
   hard to refactor in the future if other issues in the v4l2-async 
   framework where to be addressed. By hiding the notifier in the struct 
   v4l2_subdev and adding a new function to set that structure the 
   interface towards drivers are minimized while everything else happens 
   in the v4l2-async framework. This leaves the interface in a good 
   position for possible changes in v4l2-async.

This is tested on Renesas H3 and M3-W together with the Renesas CSI-2
and VIN Gen3 driver (posted separately). It is based on top of the media-tree.

* Changes since v3
- Almost a complete rewrite, so drop all Ack-ed by tags.
- Do not add new functions to register/unregister subnotifiers from 
  callbacks. Instead have have the subdevice drivers populate the 
  subnotifer list at probe time and have the v4l2-async framework handle 
  the (un)registration of the notifiers.
- Synchronize the call off the complete() callbacks. They will now all 
  happens once all notifiers in a pipeline are all complete and from the 
  edge towards the root device.
- Add a new function v4l2_async_subdev_register_notifier() to hide the 
  setup of the subnotifier internals to ease improvements later.

* Changes since v2
- Fixed lots of spelling mistakes, thanks Hans!
- Used a goto instead if state variable when restarting iteration over
  subdev list as suggested by Sakari. Thank you it's much easier read
  now.
- Added Acked-by from Sakari and Hans, thanks!
- Rebased to latest media-tree.

* Changes since v1:
- Added a pre-patch which adds an error check which was previously in
  the new incremental async code but is more useful on its own.
- Added documentation to Documentation/media/kapi/v4l2-subdev.rst.
- Fixed data type of bool variable.
- Added call to lockdep_assert_held(), thanks Sakari.
- Fixed commit messages typo, thanks Sakari.
