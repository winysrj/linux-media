What about DEVNODE? I think that would be a good alternative.

SUBDEV refers to a specific type of driver. Within the v4l world it is
well defined. So I prefer to keep this. Perhaps some additional comments
or documentation can be added to clarify this.

I agree. It was always the plan to eventually add connectors, but v4l
didn't really need it (it already has an API to enumerate connectors).

I don't think it is right to talk about 'represents devices'. I'd rephrase
it to 'connects to devices'.

I don't think this will be a problem. Initially we probably won't be
enumerating connectors for V4L since it already has its own API for that.
