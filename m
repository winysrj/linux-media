I'm not the only person who will hate to see you leave!  Many people
are disgusted by this stunt they pulled and while your absence will be
a great loss to the linux dvb community, I understand & accept your
position on it.  Unfortunately the politics, backstabbing, and dirty
tactics has been driving away some very good people & assets away.  I
can only hope that some day people will be put in charge who are
unbiased and don't let their personal feelings interfere with what's
best for the community.
