Yes, but "driver version" were never used as such. Several drivers got lots of
updates, ABI change behavior (like the removal of V4L1 API), etc without having
a single "driver version" increment. Other drivers increase it even on minor
changes.

IMO, it makes no sense on keeping it, but removing this field would break 
userspace, as a few programs seem to use it.

Yes, but, again, this doesn't happen. In general, the drivers that use it either
increment the version number on a separate patch, or integrate it with one of
the patches.

It is easy to take a look at ivtv, as it has a separate file with the version
number:

$ git log --oneline drivers/media/video/ivtv/ivtv-version.h
4359e5b V4L/DVB: ivtv: Increment driver version due to firmware loading changes
c019f90 V4L/DVB (10965): ivtv: bump version
c58dc0b V4L/DVB (8633): ivtv: update ivtv version number
be303e1 V4L/DVB (7930): ivtv: bump version to 1.3.0.
fcbbf6f V4L/DVB (7759): ivtv: increase version number to 1.2.1
0170a48 V4L/DVB (6762): ivtv: update version number to 1.2
612570f V4L/DVB (6091): ivtv: header cleanup
f38a798 V4L/DVB (5909): ivtv: update version to 1.1 to mark ivtv-fb support
1a0adaf V4L/DVB (5345): ivtv driver for Conexant cx23416/cx23415 MPEG encoder/decoder

Looking at the details of the above commits, on several cases there's no explanation
why the version was incremented, or why an userspace application should bother to have
any special treatment for that version or for the previous one.

The date of the commits also don't help much:

Date:   Sat Jun 12 13:55:33 2010 -0300

Even when there seems to have a good reason for version bump, like on this example
(from cx18 driver):

commit 9982be8
Author: Andy Walls <awalls@radix.net>
Date:   Wed Apr 15 20:49:19 2009 -0300

    V4L/DVB (11620): cx18: Increment version due to significant buffer handling changes
    
    Version bump from 1.1.0 to 1.2.0
    
    Signed-off-by: Andy Walls <awalls@radix.net>
    Signed-off-by: Mauro Carvalho Chehab <mchehab@redhat.com>

The commit message doesn't help to tell the application developer how version 1.1.0 is
different than version 1.2.0.

Also, as this is on a separate commit, if the buffer changes were backported into a
stable or distro kernel, the application will have no way to detect the differences.

On several cases, the version upgrade is simply due to the addition of a new type of
support, like this one:

commit 437b775
Author: Andy Walls <awalls@md.metrocast.net>
Date:   Sun Mar 27 00:43:30 2011 -0300

    [media] cx18: Bump driver version, since a new class of HVR-1600 is properly supported
    
    Make a user visible driver version change, for the inevitable user support
    questions about why newer model HVR-1600's do not work with (older
    versions of) the cx18 driver.

For things like that, it would be enough to simply increment MODULE_VERSION().

As I've explained before, even that is wrong, as the version increment
patch may not have been backported.

New features could also be backported without version increment. This happens
from time to time at the enterprise distros, and on long duration stable
releases.

Version number is not enough for that. When there are such panic/OOPS bugs,
they are backported to -stable and to the distro kernels.

An application doing that will be removing a feature that is probably already
fixed.
