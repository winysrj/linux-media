Hello,

I have seen Javier's v8 patch for the Aptina/Micron mt9p031 on 
beagleboard-xm and I'd be interested in getting the mt9m112 (Leopard 
Imaging LBCM1M1) to work

can the LI-5M03 be used to test the patch?

what is supposed to work / what not?

on which tree is the patch based?

is someone working on support for the LBCM1M1 (mt9m112)?

since there is already support for the mt9m112 sensor in 
drivers/media/video/mt9m111.c for the soc-camera framework what would be 
the stragegy w.r.t. the omap3isp framework?


thanks, regards, p.
