I have that too, if i'm not logged in :) if you are logged in, it should 
work (with an active account). Try 'private session' or whatever you 
have in your browser (ctrl-p top of my head in ff) and ensure you login. 
If it still does not work, something else may be broken.

Is your account very new? You may not be authorised after all yet? I 
don't know the answer then.
