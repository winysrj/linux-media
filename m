Most certainly.

pxa27x_camera is actively maintained, the latest submission request for merge
is 11 days ago :
  https://lkml.org/lkml/2016/2/8/789

I can submit a patch in MAINTAINERS if you wish to take it in my bucket.

I am maintaining the pxa architecture, and I do have the hardware to test the
submissions. As you will see in the above message the driver works fine with
v4.5-rc2.

If you want modifications, let me know, explain to me what you want, and I'll
see how to carry them out (because vb1 out of context is obfuscated to me). A
good explanation would a an example of another driver pxa_camera should look
like, so that I can see the difference in the APIs from soc_camera and evaluate
the work to be done.

Same thing as above, I can commit at least for mt9m111.c, for which I have both
the hardware and the knowledge. I cannot speak for the other drivers.

So all in all, if you point me in the right direction, I'll take care of the
changes in pxa_camera.c and mt9m111.c.

Cheers.
