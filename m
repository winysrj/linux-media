thanks for the report, i might find a starting point from here.

Unfortunately not, but all the devices mentioned are on a similar level
for my view, means decoder chips and tuners are compatible in the same
row like MK3, MK4, MK5 and saa7134, saa7135 and as long in production
probably still available.

I'm just scratching that stuff for debug, and I'm not even aware of such
a restriction and it is long time ago I looked a little into it.

Maybe Hans, Steve or Mike can give you better recommendations.
