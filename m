I notice it when I am reading the code,
so I do not know if any driver is broken.

Sorry that the cover letter is a bit misleading, hope you does not skip the
patch due to this.

The actual problem is that userland virtual address is erroneously passed to
vm_iomap_memory, while it expects physical address.
And that is what the patch try to address.

Seems this bug can be exploited to map and access physical address.
So it is also a security problem, I think we should ether fix it
or remove the code if not used any more.
