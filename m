Thanks, I will take a look at your tree when I am back to the office next week.

I also see that Linaro's tree has support for VPU for mx5/mx6:
http://git.linaro.org/gitweb?p=landing-teams/working/freescale/kernel.git;a=summary

,so we should probably think in unifying it with mx27 support there too.

Ok, sounds good.

Yes, correct.

I will need to check this next week when I am back to the office.
