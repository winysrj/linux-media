Same patch, different situation ;)

Yes. This patch doesn't change anything in practice, but it allows RT people
to keep working on their series of changes, giving us a little more time to 
work on a definitive solution. If nacked, we would need to send an alternative
patch for them, and, as this is not ready (and such patch applied via RT tree would
likely cause merge conflicts with our patches), the better is to just ack and keep 
writing the patch that will solve the issue.

Your patch were very useful, as it started the discussions for the BKL removal
on drivers/media drivers.
