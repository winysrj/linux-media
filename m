static int lme2510_get_usb_stream_config(struct dvb_frontend *fe,
		struct usb_data_stream_properties *stream)
{
	struct dvb_usb_adapter *adap;
	struct lme2510_state *state;

	stream->type = USB_BULK;
	stream->count = 10;
	stream->u.bulk.buffersize = 4096;

// ugly part begins
	if (fe == NULL)
		return 0;
	adap = fe->dvb->priv;
	state = adap->dev->priv;
// ugly part ends

	if (state->chip_id == lme2510c)
		stream->endpoint = 8;
	else
		stream->endpoint = 6;

	return 0;
}

Ugly part between comments is what I am going to change, but currently 
it works as is.
