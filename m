Another option is you could do this for MFD devices:

struct mfd_device {
        struct platform_devce pdev;
        struct mfd_cell *cell;
};

However, that requires that drivers using the mfd_cell will *never*
get instantiated outside of the mfd infrastructure, and there is no
way to protect against this so it is probably a bad idea.

Or, mfd_cell could be added to platform_device directly which would
*by far* be the safest option at the cost of every platform_device
having a mostly unused mfd_cell pointer.  Not a significant cost in my
opinion.

One last option is I'm prototyping a way to add type-safe structure
pointers to a device, but that requires nasty CPP tricks and it's not
complete yet.  The cure might be worse than the disease here.

This approach worries me because it changes the behaviour on a
per-device basis.  That could be difficult to maintain a mental model
for.  I'd rather see consistent behaviour.
