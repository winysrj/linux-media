Subject: [PATCH v3 0/6] Driver for Si476x series of chips

This is a third version of the patchset originaly posted here:
https://lkml.org/lkml/2012/9/13/590

Second version of the patch was posted here:
https://lkml.org/lkml/2012/10/5/598

To save everyone's time I'll repost the original description of it:

This patchset contains a driver for a Silicon Laboratories 476x series
of radio tuners. The driver itself is implemented as an MFD devices
comprised of three parts: 
 1. Core device that provides all the other devices with basic
functionality and locking scheme.
 2. Radio device that translates between V4L2 subsystem requests into
Core device commands.
 3. Codec device that does similar to the earlier described task, but
for ALSA SoC subsystem.

v3 of this driver has following changes:
 - All custom ioctls were moved to be V4L2 controls or debugfs files
 - Chip properties handling was moved to regmap API, so this should
   allow for cleaner code, and hopefully more consistent behaviour of
   the driver during switch between AM/FM(wich involevs power-cycling
   of the chip)

I was hoping to not touch the code of the codec driver, since Mark has
already appplied the previous version, but because of the last item I
had to.

Unfotunately, since my ARM setup runs only 3.1 kernel, I was only able
to test this driver on a standalone USB-connected board that has a
dedicated Cortex M3 working as a transparent USB to I2C bridge which
was connected to a off-the-shelf x86-64 laptop running Ubuntu with
custom kernel compile form git.linuxtv.org/media_tree.git. Which means
that I was unable to test the change in the codec code, except for the
fact the it compiles.


Here is v4l2-compliance output for one of the tuners(as per Hans'
request):
