Or option 
4) just enable the LNA unconditionally.  

I did some testing in my environment, and I was unable to tune anything
on either DVB-T or DVB-C without the LNA enabled.  I'm of course aware
that this depends on your signal, but have you actually seen a real life
signal where tuning fails with the LNA enabled and works without it?

I do believe that my DVB-C signal at least is pretty strong.
