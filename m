Good reception on one device, completely different story on another
device - same cable; different tuner sensitivity.
It is *very* important to achieve *very* good signal reception with
larger dish(DVB-S) and/or Yagi-Uda(DVB-T) - focal angle/directional gain.
Try this one:
dvbstream -f freq -o 8192 > full-mux.ts
enough free disk space ;)
mplayer -cache 8912 full-mux.ts (TAB-TAB-TABâ€¦)
or
dvbstream -f freq -o vid aid tid pid > single-stream.ts
