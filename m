I do have the stk1160 chip datasheet. However, it's not publicly
available and I'm not sure I should disclose it (although syntek never
advise me against it). In additio, the datasheet is not very verbose
and the information is scarce and often incomplete.

Apparently it does: at least there's a flag to "enable" VBI mode.

I agree with this. I don't have any VBI source so there's no way I can
work on this (not to mention it's not something lots of users need).
