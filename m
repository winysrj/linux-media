It doesn't prevent us from keeping the flash devices related
DT bindings unified across kernel subsystems. The DT bindings
docs for the adp1653 could just provide a reference to the
led/common.txt bindings. In the future, when LED Flash
class will be merged, all the V4L2 Flash drivers might be
moved to the LED subsystem to gain the LED subsystem support.

Some devices can control more than one led. The array is for such
purposes. The system-status should be probably renamed to
something more generic for both common leds and flash leds,
e.g. system-led.

Then you should define three properties:

iout-torch = <[uA]>;
iout-flash = <[uA]>;
iout-indicator = <[uA]>;

iout-torch and iout-flash properties would determine the current
for the white led in the torch and flash modes respectively and
the iout-indicator property would determine the current for
the indicator led.

I am using max77693 [1] and aat1290 [2]. OK, I will add you on cc.

The rationale for unification of the LED and V4L2 Flash API
can be found in the discussion [3]. The glue is the v4l2-flash [4]
module which exposes a sub-device, that controls a LED Flash class
device with use of LED Flash class API.

The v4l2-flash sub-device registers with v4l2-async API
in a media device. Exemplary support for v4l2-flash
sub-devices is added to the exynos4-is driver in the patch [5].
