Just tested the Ubuntu packaged kernel.org git snapshot of 2.6.35
(2010-06-15 15:05) and much the same results happen. Scanning throws
the same timeout and mplayer the same error messages although it now
quits after a while:

vlc for some reason no longer shows the error messages but it doesn't
work either.

One thing I forgot to mention before is that femon does show a lock:

(Showing snr in % seems very strange here)

One thing I forgot to mention is that I bought the U3100 at a retailer
and it seems to have been opened before so there is a chance it is
broken somehow.
