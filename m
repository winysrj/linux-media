isn't that exactly what he's trying to achieve ? Moving TASK_* to its
own header is one approach, what other approach do you suggest ?

yes.

so maybe just dropping completion.h from sched.h would do it.

you wouldn't prevent the underlying problem which is the need to include
sched.h whenever you include wait.h and use wake_up*()
