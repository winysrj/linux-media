Hi Andrew

Thanks for an update, looks much better now, still, a couple of things 
_have_ to be corrected before we can push it:

This

and this dev_info() you might want to change to dev_dbg(). You don't want 
the driver to be too noisy. A couple more occasions below

In the previous version you had comments for streamoff::

+	/* Software Reset */
and
+	/* Setting Streaming to Standby */

you can still use them now. Besides, the following is a bit shorter and I 
find it slightly better readable:

+		ret = ov9740_reg_write(client, OV9740_SOFTWARE_RESET, 0x01);
+		if (!ret)
+			ret = ov9740_reg_write(client, OV9740_MODE_SELECT, 0x00);

I asked you to use the platform data here... If you don't do that, then 
at least, please, preserve your comment from the original version:

+	/*
+	 * REVISIT: the camera probably can do 10 bit transfers, but I don't
+	 *          have those pins connected on my hardware.

Why don't you just remove the "code" parameter as I proposed in my 
previous review? I don't see why you need it, and if it is ever needed, 
it can always be re-added.

Ok, this is the important one: sorry, this is not what I meant. You 
shouldn't fail try_fmt(), that's right, but you should _always_ return 
valid data from it. In your case you just can set mf->code and 
mf->colorspace always to your fixed values and remove the switch 
completely.
