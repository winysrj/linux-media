I can't remember the dirty details about this driver, sorry. The first
patch on it might shed some light:


commit 46a60cfef581307d8273919182ae939d44ff7cca
Author: Fabio Belavenuto <belavenuto@gmail.com>

    V4L/DVB (10155): Add TEA5764 radio driver
    
    Add support for radio driver TEA5764 from NXP.
    This chip is connected in pxa I2C bus in EZX phones
    from Motorola, the chip is used in phone model A1200.
    This driver is for OpenEZX project (www.openezx.org)
    Tested with A1200 phone, openezx kernel and fm-tools

>From the above, I _suspect_ that the default (whatever it is) is due to
the Motorola A1200 phone. Not sure if it is compiled as module or as builtin
at OpenEZX.
