This time, we'll be using ELC registration site to track. I'll see how
we can get this info with LF as well, but, as people can join it
dynamically, the best is to get the list with them on Thursday evening,
and double-check during the Summit to track last-minute changes.

Actually, there are two threads and two followup emails. The detailed info
is at:

  https://www.mail-archive.com/linux-media@vger.kernel.org/msg85910.html
  https://www.mail-archive.com/linux-media@vger.kernel.org/msg85979.html
  https://www.mail-archive.com/linux-media@vger.kernel.org/msg83883.html
  https://www.mail-archive.com/linux-media@vger.kernel.org/msg83884.html

I'll prepare a summary covering everything into a single file to make
easier, and I'll prepare some slides with the topic highlights.

I'm almost sure we are on our on for lunch. I'll double check this also
with LF.
