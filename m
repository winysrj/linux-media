Yeah, that's actually what I wanted to say, but failed at ... Another
thing is that at least for i915, _writecombine isn't what we want actually
because:
- It won't work anyway cause i915 maps stuff cached and does the flushing
  itself and x86 PAT doesn't support mixed mappings (kinda like arm).
- It isn't actually enough, there's another hidden buffer between the
  memory controller interface and the gpu that i915 manually flushes
  (because even a readback on a wc mapping doesn't flush things in there).

So I assume we'll have plenty of funny beating out a good api for cpu
access ;-)

Cheers, Daniel
