It's not just my setup, auto-suspend works for the vast majority of webcams. 
It has been enabled three years ago, with a report that Fedora had enabled it 
by carrying a kernel patch for a while, without any user complaint.

USB autosuspend is an important power saving feature. I would be fine with 
enabling it in userspace if we could find a reasonable, cross-distro way to 
create, maintain and distribute the list of devices that support USB 
autosuspend properly.
