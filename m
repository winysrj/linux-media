What race condition are you referring to?

That's nice, but why should I enable this?  Or will drivers enable it
automatically?

Why this limit?

Are you sure this is a good name for a camera?

Only one major number?  Is it always dynamic?

You forgot to free the device structure here as well, right?

How could this happen?  And are you sure -EIO is correct?

Same as above, and same comment in other places (poll, ioctl.)

By virtue of having the reference to the module held by the vfs, this
shouldn't ever go away, even if the lock is not held.

So you can unregister a device at any time, even if the device is open,
or about to be opened?  Then that's fine, but you can put the lock after
the container_of(), right?

How is that holding anything into memory?  Don't you want to keep the
module that the fops pointer in the device in memory, not necessarily
the device itself?

No reference counting for the fops?  Why not?

Anyway, it looks like what you really want is an "easier" way to handle
a cdev and a struct device that will export the proper information to
userspace, right?

Why not do this generically, fixing up the cdev interface (which really
needs it) and not tie it to media devices at all, making it possible for
_everyone_ to use this type of infrastructure?

That seems like the better thing to do here.
