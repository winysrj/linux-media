currently latest is always ours and Mauro's v4l-dvb at linuxtv.org.

For specific new drivers, latest is in the developer(s) repo(s) working
on it and that is not restricted to what is present at linuxtv.org.

We are usually three to four months in advance, until Linus' next cycle
starts and we spit all out then, but keep all the rest that needs
further work until the then next kernel release ...

Mauro's git tree is always in sync with what Linus has, but latest is
mercurial v4l-dvb and what comes in there, or, further going out into
the wild, what the individual developers have working on something
specific not yet in ...

Until they come from other git trees much in delay, or from
manufacturers trees, or other way out of sync, no problem seen here for
that the last four years.

Cheers,
Hermann
