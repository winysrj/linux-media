It is the idea it will end up in Documentation, however I had a hard time even getting people to
review the code, so I found it easier to keep code and documentation in sync by keeping it into
the commit log when I was amending things.

But yes it's the use case I use it for. The generic use case would be if you had a number of equal
locks you want to take in an arbitrary order without deadlocking or a lock protecting all those locks*.

*) In the eyes of lockdep you still take one of those locks, and nest all those locks you take into that lock.

I agree that in general you want to use the interruptible versions as much as possible,
but there are some cases in ttm where it is desirable to lock non-interruptibly.

It is a common path in case of contestion. The example lock_execbuf from the commit log used
 it. When you use the mutex_reserve_lock calls, you'll have to add calls to the *_slow variants
too when those return -EAGAIN.

I have considered it, but I never found a good way to make that happen.
mutex_lock and mutex_unlock are currently still used when only a single
buffer needs to be locked.

Thanks for the review!
