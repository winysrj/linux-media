Hi,

I've read that they are going to start trial for HD DVB on Freeview

http://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/bbcinternet/2009/06/whats_happening_with_freeview.html
http://www.dtg.org.uk/dtg/press_release.php?id=14

They mention September, October and Decembre 2009, does anybody know more detailed info?
Is it using the same transmission, just a different codec, or do we need new receivers?

Andrea
