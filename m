For me dmabuf and cenalloc offer two different features: one is buffer
sharing (dmabuf) and one is buffer allocation (cenalloc).

You may want to use dmabuf sharing feature whithout need of the buffer
allocation feature, that is what for drm, v4l2, ION and other use
dmabuf.

In addition of dmabuf we need something aware of hardware devices
constraints to allocate the buffer, that will be the role of cenalloc.
Like ION, cenalloc will also provide a usespace API to allocate
buffers but , unlike ION, the selection of the allocator will be based
on devices constraints not on heap ID.

In first step I think we can forget the bitmask approach and only use
the current fields of devices structure like coherent_dma_mask,
dma_parms->max_segment_size or dma_parms->segment_boundary_mask to
find matching allocator.

What I propose is to add in allocator ops a match(struct device*)
function which will be call at attache time.
In this way cenalloc could ask to each allocator if it is able to
allocate buffer for all attached devices.

Regards,
Benjamin
