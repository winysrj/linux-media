I tested this patch with the latest versions of git.


I found some issue, although it may be through a bad implementation of 
mine. Details of them:

1) No reports signal strength or stereo signal with KRadio. XC5000 
neither reported (modprobe xc5000 debug=1). Maybe a feature XC5000.
To listen in stereo, sometimes, you have to turn on the Digital TV then 
Analog TV and then radio.

2) To listen Analog TV I need changed to NTSC standard and then PAL-Nc 
(the norm in my country is PAL-Nc). If I leave the tune in NTSC no 
problem with sound. The patch (https://linuxtv.org/patch/9505/) corrects 
the latter, but not always.

3) If I see-Digital TV (ISDB-T), then so as to listen the radio I have 
first put the TV-Analog, because I hear very low and a strong white noise.
The latter is likely to be corrected by resetting the tuner, but I have 
not been able to do.

Thank you,

Alfredo
