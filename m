Hi there,

Yesterday a stupid kid vandalized a bunch of pages on the linuxtv wiki and 
a sysop locked to database to undo the damage. 

I would have preferred to undo that damage by simply taking a look at 
the users contribution page and using the handy-dandy undo function as a
mere wiki user. 

It would have deprived that individual the satifaction of gaining the 
sysop's attention with his anti-social behavior, but thats probably a 
policy decision that is not mine to make.

Anyway .. Now, after about 24h the wiki is still locked.
Any reason for that?

cheers
