Sure. On the hardware side, stk1160 is the USB chipset, while the
saa7115-compatible IC is the analog video decoder chip. stk1160 and
saa7115 talk through a I2C bus that's in the capture card.

On the software side, we have a similar model: the stk1160 driver
deals with the USB data and the saa7115 driver talks to the decoder
chip (through the I2C bus). Since saa7115 talks through I2C, you'll
find it under drivers/media/i2c.

stk1160 creates a subdevice that is owned by saa7115 driver. The
latter knows there's a chip on some i2c address, and then probes for
the type if chip.

I believe probing is done on saa711x_detect_chip(). To support your
device, we may have to create a new supported model here:

enum saa711x_model {
        SAA7111A,
        SAA7111,
        SAA7113,
        GM7113C,
        SAA7114,
        SAA7115,
        SAA7118,
};

If you grep GM7113C through the sources you'll be able to see how
differences between models are handled. Maybe your chip is not really
different from GM7113C or SAA7113 and all we need is to make sure it's
detected.

Don't hesitate to ask for more help over here.
