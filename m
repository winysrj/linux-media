I don't know what exactly implies to sign-off that patch, anyway you
can of course add my email there if you need to do so.
If there's any thing I can do, please tell me.
Davide
P.s.: Have you investigated the module unload problem when the stick
is removed while scanning/watching tv ?
Currently I don't have much free time to investigate as I'm writing my
bachelor's thesis on this project www.nbee.org
