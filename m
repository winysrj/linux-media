Hi

I have been using the Hauppauge Nova-T 500 Dual Tuner DVB-T cards in 
MythBuntu builds.
This product is now end of life.
It is being replaced by the Hauppauge HVR-2200 dual tuner DVB-T PCIe card. 
This is currently available but there are no Linux drivers for it.

The DVICO Dual Digital 4 PCI DVB-T card worked well in Linux until it was 
replaced a few weeks ago with a "revision2" version that has a different 
tuner and decoder and is currently unsupported. I believe Chris pascoe who 
wrote the original driver is looking into it.

There is a possibility that when the Nova-T 500 runs out ( 2 - 3 months ), 
no Dual Tuner DVB-T cards will be supported under Linux.

It seems that some ATSC PCIe cards have Linux driver support but there is 
currently nothing for DVB-T.

I would be grateful for information about the likelyhood of support for 
Hauppauge HVR2200 or any other dual tuner DVB-T cards that anyone may know 
about, or be working on.

Regards
David
