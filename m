Yeah, av7110 made history. Please notice that this series doesn't
remove any API that it is used by it. All it removes are the APIs
that there's no Kernel driver using.

Carry on APIs without client is usually a very bad idea, as nobody
could be certain about how to use it. It is even worse when such
APIs are not properly documented (with is the case here).

We have one driver for a SoC DVB hardware at:
	drivers/media/platform/sti/c8sectpfe/

I guess it still doesn't cover the entire SoC, but this is a WiP. If I
remember well, at the midia part of the SoC, they started by submitting
the Remote Controller code.

Re-adding the removed bits is easy. However, the API defined for
av7110 is old and it is showing its age: it assumes a limited number
of possible inputs/outputs. Modern SoC has a lot more ways link the
audio/video IP blocks than what the API provides. On a modern SoC,
not only DVB is supported, but also analog inputs (to support things
like composite input), cameras, HDMI inputs and even analog TV.
All of them interconnected to a media ISP. The current FF API can't
represent such hardware.

The best API to represent those pipelines that exist on SoC for
multimedia is the media controller, where all IP blocks and their
links (whatever they are) can be represented, if needed.

The audio and video DVB API is also too limited: it hasn't
evolved since when it was added. For audio, the ALSA API
allows a way more control of the hardware; for video, the
V4L2 API nowadays has all the bits to control video decoding
and encoding. Both APIs provide support for audio and video
inputs commonly found on those devices.

Also, nowadays, video decoding usually happens at the GPU on SoC. So, 
in practice, a SoC FF would likely use the DRM subsystem to control the
video codecs.

So, anyone wanting to upstream drivers for a modern FF hardware would need
to touch a lot inside the DVB API, for it to cover all the needs. A more
appropriate approach to support those devices would be, instead, 
to use a set of APIs: DVB, V4L2, ALSA, RC, CEC, MC, DRM.
