Hello folks,
i am a linux-TV newby;
dreaming to get my vdr up and runing for up to 4month
i am a blind user and have a limited access to the linux machine due
to my blindness, i access windows normaly, then ssh to linux (*SORY
FOR THAT*)
so,
i set up my debian machine correctly, runing, dbvb card detected,
scaned, working through multicast using mumuDVB
thank a lot to the #linuxtv people on freenode
they helped me a lot so i should return something:)
i installed v4l into my debian machine
if i do make load my remote control get detected
but if i reboot;
Couldn't find any node at /sys/class/rc/rc*.
so please how to make it auto loadable?
i should do that every time my pc reboot, make load
thank you a lot
BTW, can i help with mailing list moderation ?
