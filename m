I don't think these patches are in merge-able state because I only
compile tested.
Now based on Laurent's comments I just sent a v2 patch-set based in
one of our earlier changes.

This was before we decide to move the logic to VD1 so the patch-set is
less intrusive and will be easier to review.

Also, now I check for fldmode not bt656, Laurent's is right that
bt.656 is interlaced but not every interlaced video is bt.656.
