The same could be done to an integer control as well, the bitmask isn't
special in that sense. Just my opinion.

The spec says "When for example a hardware register accepts values 0-511
and the driver reports 0-65535, step should be 128." on step field in
struct v4l2_queryctrl. This suggests that registers may be exposed to
user space as integer controls.

So endianness issues may exist on other types of controls as well if the
programmer didn't remember that other endian than his existed.

I'll add a few words on this, but should it be added to bitmask controls
documentation or controls in general?
