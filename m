After another year of furious development, we are proud to announce the
birth of OpenCaster version 2.0 (licensed GPL v2).

It's still a complete DSMCC carousel server useful for MHP, MHEG and OTA

properly encoded files.

Main new 2.0 features:

     * seamless playout of off-line MPEG2 encoded videos
     * IP multicast driver for IPTV service generation
     * updated manual (one hundred page long)
     * tested with Rohde & Schwarz DVM100L for PCR precision and accuracy
     * interworking with Computer Modules DVB ASI gears
