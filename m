Manu,

Though I can't read much German, after looking at the jusst.de website I
can't help but think that you as well have financial interests driving
your actions.  If so, then your statements display quite a bit of
hypocrisy.

Manipulating (i.e. stalling) the timing of Multiproto being merged into
the v4l-dvb tree or kernel, for you or your employer's gain, would be
little different from the motivations you allege Steve of having.

Since the major gripe I'm reading on the list "is that multiproto has
taken too long" and since it seems to me the only thing that shook it
loose was a competing proposal, please save the venom for when you
actually have some clear moral high-ground to stand on.  I don't see it
from here.
 


As for the technical superiority of either API proposal; that probably
just doesn't matter.  I've seen policy/political decisions force
suboptimal technical solutions at work time and time again.  If you
really believe you have a superior product technically; then perhaps you
should work to make it superior politically as well.  Mud-slinging can't
be a good long term strategy toward that end.



Regards,
Andy
