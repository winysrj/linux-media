DEFINE and DECLARE usually have a declared variable as an argument, which 
is not the case here.

These macros are like the macros PCI_DEVICE and PCI_DEVICE_CLASS.

Are READ and WRITE the action names?  They are really the important 
information in this case.

Is it worth creating arrays where &msg is used?  Or would it be better to 
leave that aspect as it is?
