Subject: Call for testers: V4L1 support dropped from tvtime

I know this is the linux-media mailing list and not the tvtime mailing
list, but it seems relevant given the overlap in the user base and the
fact that these changes are specifically in response to recent events
with v4l-dvb.

I have modified the KernelLabs build of tvtime to no longer depend on V4L1.

The tree can be found here:

Comments/testers welcome.

Regards,

Devin
