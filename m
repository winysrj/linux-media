hm, "from what I've been told".

I thought we might get a lot of feedback during the athletics in Berlin
currently, if it is such worse.

Nothing like that. Strange?

Since BBC-HD is still good enough, I'm still not on S2, but I likely
soon will give it a try.

I'll happily receive any kicks on anything faulty then, but I doubt I
have to take them.

Cheers,
Hermann
