Just to let you all know that I will be handling the agenda. I'll prepare a 
first version of it this weekend and the final one next weekend.

The basic outline is the same as during previous meetings: the first day we go 
through all the agenda points and make sure everyone understands the problem. 
Smaller issues will be discussed and decided, more complex issues are just 
discussed.

The second day we go in depth into the complex issues and try to come up with 
ideas that might work. The last day we translate the all agenda items into 
actions.

This approach worked well in the past and it ensures that we end up with 
something concrete. Also note that this is a brainstorm meeting, so the final 
decisions will have to be taken on the mailinglist.

Those who have a vested interest in an agenda item should be prepared to 
explain it and if necessary have a presentation ready.

There is a lot of ground to cover, so we should try to avoid wasting too much 
time :-)

Regards,

	Hans
