well, let's divide things up into two categories:

1) the arrangement and format of pixels.. ie. what userspace would
need to know if it mmap's a buffer.  This includes pixel format,
stride, etc.  This should be negotiated in userspace, it would be
crazy to try to do this in the kernel.

2) the physical placement of the pages.  Ie. whether it is contiguous
or not.  Which bank the pages in the buffer are placed in, etc.  This
is not visible to userspace.  This is the purpose of the attach step,
so you know all the devices involved in sharing up front before
allocating the backing pages.  (Or in the worst case, if you have a
"late attacher" you at least know when no device is doing dma access
to a buffer and can reallocate and move the buffer.)  A long time
back, I had a patch that added a field or two to 'struct
device_dma_parameters' so that it could be known if a device required
contiguous buffers.. looks like that never got merged, so I'd need to
dig that back up and resend it.  But the idea was to have the 'struct
device' encapsulate all the information that would be needed to
do-the-right-thing when it comes to placement.

no, userspace should not need to know this.  And having a central
driver that knows this for all the other drivers in the system doesn't
really solve anything and isn't really scalable.  At best you might
want, in some cases, a flag you can pass when allocating.  For
example, some of the drivers have a 'SCANOUT' flag that can be passed
when allocating a GEM buffer, as a hint to the kernel that 'if this hw
requires contig memory for scanout, allocate this buffer contig'.  But
really, when it comes to sharing buffers between devices, we want this
sort of information in dev->dma_params of the importing device(s).
