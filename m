I would imagine that is usually to reduce costs. I assume that the buyers 
for the companies are always trying to negotiate lower prices to increase 
profit margins, and playing the various chip suppliers off against each 
other to shave a few cents off the components. If Dibcom refuse to lower 
their price any further, then the company will switch to ULI or some other 
manufacturer.

Supply volume might also be an issue - maybe the current manufacturer cannot 
provide enough volume.

Failure rate of the components might also be an issue.

Regards,

Phil.
