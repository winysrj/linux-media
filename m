One concern I know the Android folks have expressed previously (and
correct me if its no longer an objection), is that this attach time
in-kernel constraint solving / moving or reallocating buffers is
likely to hurt determinism.  If I understood, their perspective was
that userland knows the device path the buffers will travel through,
so why not leverage that knowledge, rather then having the kernel have
to sort it out for itself after the fact.

The concern about determinism even makes them hesitant about CMA, over
things like carveout, as they don't want to be moving pages around at
allocation time (which could hurt reasonable use cases like the time
it takes to launch a camera app - which is quite important). Though
maybe this concern will lessen as more CMA solutions ship.

I worry some of this split between fully general solutions vs
hard-coded known constraints is somewhat intractable. But what might
make it easier to get android folks interested in approaches like the
attach-time allocation / relocating on late-attach you're proposing is
if there is maybe some way, as you suggested, to hint the allocation
when they do know the device paths, so they can provide that insight
and can avoid *all* reallocations.

Then of course, there's the question of how to consistently hint
things for all the different driver allocation interfaces (and that,
maybe naively, leads to the central allocator approach).
