Hi all,
I bought the AVerTV Volar Black HD (A850) USB DVB-t stick. The picture
quality on Ubuntu 10.04 is great. Unfortunately the stick stops
working after a few hours.

I'm very happy I found another threads in here about this issue. Good
to know I'm not the only one with this issue.

There's an af9015 in this USB stick, I found a recent thread where
Antti Palosaari says that devices with this chip sometimes hang and
it's hard to reproduce.
(http://www.mail-archive.com/linux-media@vger.kernel.org/msg18631.html)

He sent a link to the newest firmware 5.1.0, which should resolve this
issue (http://www.mail-archive.com/linux-media@vger.kernel.org/msg18650.html).
Unfortunately this doesn't absolutely change the behaviour.

All my family members know that the only solution for this no dvb
reception issue is to shutdown the pc and to reboot. But they're not
really happy with the situation. I'd do anything to help you guys in
finding the reason for this issue.

Is there anything I can do to support you?

Thanks in advance,
Adam
