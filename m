Having MC filters and demux device node filter separately also help not to break existing LinuxDVB demux API.

On the other hand, we'll have troubles with existing applications if this is not implemented.
So, we'll need anyway to associate a PID filter with a DVBv5 call. At V4L, this will be solved
via v4l-utils. We probably need to discuss it better for DVB.

Yes, only av7110 uses it. Well, let's first add MC support to DVB. We can take care
of the details like that when we'll have something coded.
