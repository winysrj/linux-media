The synchronization takes place inside phy_get.  If phy_create hasn't
been called for this structure by the time phy_get runs, phy_get will 
return an error.

I'm not sure what you mean here.  Of course I can't prevent a board 
file from messing up a data structure.  I can't prevent it from causing 
memory access violations either; in fact, I can't prevent any bugs in 
other people's code.

Besides, why do you say the board file is free to do whatever it wants 
with the struct phy?  Currently the struct phy is created by the PHY 
provider and the PHY core, right?  It's not even mentioned in the board 
file.

If you want to keep the phy struct completely separate from the board
file, there's an easy way to do it.  Let's say the board file knows
about N different PHYs in the system.  Then you define an array of N
pointers to phys:

struct phy *(phy_address[N]);

In the platform data for both PHY j and its controller, store
&phy_address[j].  The PHY provider passes this cookie to phy_create:

	cookie = pdev->dev.platform_data;
	ret = phy_create(phy, cookie);

and phy_create simply stores: *cookie = phy.  The PHY consumer does
much the same the same thing:

	cookie = pdev->dev.platform_data;
	phy = phy_get(cookie);

phy_get returns *cookie if it isn't NULL, or an ERR_PTR otherwise.

You ought to be able to adapt this scheme to work with DT.  Maybe by 
having multiple "phy_address" arrays.
