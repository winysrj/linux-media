Basically any gspca driver that can set registers in the i2c device
(as opposed to only replaying USB commands) can be modified so the i2c
part can be split off into a regular sub-device driver. I've discussed
this in the past with Hans de Goede and that is definitely the way to go.

Looking at the code I'd say that it should be possible to implement an
i2c_adapter in m5602_core.c, and when that's in place the various sensor
drivers can be gradually split off into generic subdev drivers. Which is
of course ever so much easier if the datasheets are available :-)

For this particular bridge driver I strongly suggest that this approach
is taken since there are already duplicate sensor drivers here (mt9m111).
