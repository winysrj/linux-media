I strongly disagree with exposing low-level hardware details like tiling
to userspace. If we have to do the negotiation of those things in
userspace we will end up with having to pipe those information through
things like the wayland protocol. I don't see how this could ever be
considered a good idea.

I would rather see kernel drivers negotiating those things at dmabuf
attach time in way invisible to userspace. I agree that this negotiation
thing isn't easy to get right for the plethora of different hardware
constraints we see today, but I would rather see this in-kernel, where
we have the chance to fix things up if needed, than in a fixed userspace
interface.

Lucas
