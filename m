Right, and I'd just copy this text to subdev-formats.rst rather than referring
to it.

And that makes no sense as it would make things even more difficult.

So I believe it's best to be clear about it and talk about image height
instead of frame height.

Just double check first in the code if there are any subdevs that support
TOP/BOTTOM/ALTERNATE and how they fill in the height, I don't think we
have any at the moment, but I'm not 100% certain.
