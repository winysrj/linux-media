Steven, I appreciate your concern.

But the legal parts are of no concern to us, and we are already aware
of potential legal complexities, especially in western countries, but
fortunately there are many other countries outside of the western
hemisphere. There is also plenty of internet based providers that
already offers this, albeit with a less than ideal quality of service.
So consider that a non issue for now.

I'd like to keep this discussion on the technological aspects.
