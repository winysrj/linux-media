During your vacation somebody else could ad patches if you 
wanted to work with other developers.
This could only happen if you have your code under linuxtv.org and or
merged it completely to v4l-dvb!

You are the maintainer of multiproto and 
So nobody could work on it in your absence time!

Sorry this sounds not ok to me.

Anyway the problem is nobody should leave linuxtv.org project. 
We should now stop this and go on.
Please !!!!!!!!!
Thanks for your great work!

Halim
