Hi,

Odd widths are not allowed, the driver will adjust width to be multiple
of 16 pixels. However, you can adjust the usable area more precisely with
VIDIOC_S_CROP or VIDIOC_S_SELECTION ioctl. I still need to do some work to
define properly the selection ioctl on mem-to-mem devices in the V4L2
documentation.

This shouldn't really happen. Are you checking pixelformat after VIDIOC_S_FMT
call ? Isn't it adjusted to some valid and supported by the driver format ?
