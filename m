In the absence of any feedback to my query, I had a look at the driver 
entry for this device in a Win7 system.
It shows as:  Videomate U1xx Digital Series
The driver was written by Realtek and is version 5.55.828.2009
So, I guess there may be a number of devices in this series with the 
same chipset.
Does this ring any bells with anyone?

Thanks
Drappa
