Yes, I will prepare some introduction, maybe a couple of slides. My 
impression is, that we shall be making all topics as short as possible, 
so, I'll try to make it concise, but I don't know exactly yet how much 
time we'd get.

In principle - yes, sure, I'd love you to present your use-case, but as I 
said - no idea whether we'll have time for this. So, definitely, would be 
great if you could comment on the topic, if we get time, slides would be 
great too, so, if it's not too complicated for you - please prepare them, 
but unfortunately I do not know yet whether we'll get a chance to go 
through them. In fact, I'm not quite sure how topics without an explicitly 
mentioned presentation should work - there would be some introduction in 
any case, right, Hans? Just not as long as a "proper presentation?" And 
the mentioned 10 minutes are only for the presentation, the discussion 
comes on top of that? So, I think, we should have time for your slides, 
Vaibhav, Hans can correct me if I'm wrong;)

Thanks
Guennadi
