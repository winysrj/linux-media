Hi,
Are there any "100%" supported USB analog video capture devices for
V4L2? I'd like to be sure before I buy a device. All I require is RCA
and SVideo + onboard audio capture (i.e. no extra line in cable...)

I'm in Australia so devices that can be found via www.staticice.com.au
or ebay.com.au would be appreciated.

Thanks,
Adam Baxter
