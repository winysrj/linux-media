Not quite so. The flash is associated to the sensor (and lens) using the
group ID in the Media controller. The user space doesn't need to "know" this
association.

More complex use cases such as the above may need extensions to the Media
controller API.

I do propose leaving it out. If we should have such a thing we should think
it in a larger scope than just flash strobing.
