I didn't have high hopes you would agree to the simpler approach. :)

Right this is another problem that needs to be addressed in the
user-space.

I would recommend trying to bound the problems that need to be solved
for the first phase of this media token feature. If we don't we will
never be done with it. :)

I would propose the first step as addressing dvb and v4l2 conflicts
and include snd-usb-audio so there is confidence that the media token
approach can span non-media drivers.

I am currently testing with tvtime, xawtv, vlc, and kaffeine. I am
planning to add kradio for snd-usb-audio work for the next round of
patches.

This is not an issue for fine grained approach since simpler approach
is nacked. i.e Mauro suggested changing S_PRIORITY as another place
to release it if we were to go with simple appraoch (open/close).

Please see my bounding the problem comment. Can these devices wait until
the second phase. We have multiple combinations with hardware features,
applications. The way I am designing the media token is if driver
doesn't create the token, no change in the dvb-core, v4l2-core behavior.
It is not required that driver must create a token to allow evolving
driver support and hardware support as we go.
