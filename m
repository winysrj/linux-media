Unfortunately, I'm very busy those days, testing a big patch series that it is
re-writing one subsystem on several machines. Due to that, I had to reduce
the timeslot for patch review.

If your patches are at patchwork.linuxtv.org, you shouldn't worry... the patches
are on my queue ;)

I'll review them in time for 3.4.

Mauro
