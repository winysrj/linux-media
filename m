Forget all that has with stability to do on Linux, it will never work!
It is my experience after three years of desperate trying. I have the
same card and some others. Sometimes they works sometimes no. 24 hours
running is called High Availability in IT world and can be assured only
by the commercial solutions. Believe me, I spent 14 years in commercial
Unix and know what I am talking about.
