Proper handling of video stream is a hard task and can be very tricky.
In order to avoid duplicated stuff, the video streaming buffer handling,
implemented by videobuf2 (aka VB2), is part of the media core, 
and it was written to be as much architecture-independent as possible.
There is a previous implementation of it, and we're gradually changing
the drivers to VB2, as it is more robust and fixes some known issues
with the legacy one.

The VB2 core has one generic driver, completely independent on the memory
model, with provides the interface for the V4L drivers, and 3 memory-specific
ones that match the DMA needs for that architecture and device:

	- one for vmalloc'ed memory - used by USB based devices where double
buffering is needed in order to strip USB protocol packets from the video
payload;
	- one for DMA scatter/gather - most PCI/PCIe devices use DMA
scatter/gather;

	- one for DMA where a continuous memory is required to fit an entire
video image (videobuf2-dma-contig). This is generally required by the 
embedded drivers, as either the video capture IP block and/or the DMA
engine can't handle scatter/gather pages.

So, while the current drivers that use videobuf2-dma-contig are (mainly)
for x86 and arm, the better is for videobuf2-dma-contig to be able of
working with all possible architectures, as I'm sure that sooner or later
a video device will be needed at the other architectures, and this driver
will be needed there.

That's said, changing from *cpu_addr to **cpu_addr sounds ok on my
eyes, but Pawel and Marek knows a lot more about videobuf2 than me,
as they wrote this driver. So, they can contribute more with the
interface specifics.

>From my side, I don't care that much with the needed API changes
for the DMA interfaces to be generic, provided that the v4l2 core
compilation won't depend on any CONFIG_ARCH* Kconfig symbol, and
that all architectures implement the DMA API interfaces at the same
way, so, there will be no need to add #if's inside the videobuf2 code[1].

Regards,
Mauro

[1] Unfortunately, there's currently one such #if's there, in order to
support (sub)architectures where there's no MMU.
