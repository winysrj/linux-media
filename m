Didn't read the entire thread, but it seems that this were already solved.

The patches for IR to work with NEC-24/32 bits and RC6 mode 0 were posted.

All it lacks after applying the patches is likely to:
	1) put any dummy IR table on the board card logic, to enable IR code;
	2) run ir-keycode -t on his hardware to get the remote controller scancode;
	3) find the table that matches his IR at drivers/media/rc/keymaps/
	   or add a new one with the discovered scancodes;
	4) put the right IR table ad em28xx-cards.c;
	5) send the final patches upstream.

The above is obviously not using the patches I sent yesterday/today, otherwise,
it would be seeing, instead, the full 32 bits code there.

Also, the better is to use ir-keytable program on test mode ("ir-keytable -t"),
as it allows to see if the 3 protocol messages received by each keystroke are
being received (EV_MSC, EV_KEY and EV_SYN).

Agreed. This is a separate question, and should be handled on a different
thread.
