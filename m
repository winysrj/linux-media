Hey,

I signed up to this list because I found this thread in the archives when googling for a driver for my Dazzle. Unfortunately I can't reply to an email I did not get.

Like Keith Lawson I'm a developer with no kernel experience, although I have some experience with C and libusb. I'd be happy to help in any way possible.

If there are any Dutch linux-media developers we could do a little hackathon maybe?

Unrelated: How do people manage to not be ovewhelmed by such a high-volume list?

Cheers,
Pepijn de Vos
