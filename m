While discussing this stuff with Maarten I've read through the generic
mutex code, and I think we could adapt the ideas from in there (which
would boil down to a single atomice op for the fastpath for both reserve
and unreserve, which even have per-arch optimized asm). So I think we can
make the per-obj lock as fast as it's possible, since the current ttm
fences already use that atomic op.

For passing the reservation_ticket down the callstacks I guess with a
common reservation systems used for shared buffers (which is the idea
here) we can make a good case to add a pointer to the current thread info.
Especially for cross-device reservations through dma_buf I think that
would simplify the interfaces quite a bit.

Wrt the dma_ prefix I agree it's not a stellar name, but since the
intention is to use this together with dma_buf and dma_fence to faciliate
cross-device madness it does fit somewhat ...

Fyi I hopefully get around to play with Maarten's patches a bit, too. One
of the things I'd like to add to the current reservation framework is
lockdep annotations. Since if we use this across devices it's way too easy
to nest reservations improperly, or to create deadlocks because one thread
grabs another lock while holding reservations, while another tries to
reserve buffers while holding that lock.

Hm, atm we only call back to the driver for dma_fences when adding a
callback (or waiting for the fence in a blocking fashion). I guess we
could add another interface that just does this call, without adding any
callback - as a heads-up of sorts for drivers where making a fence signal
in time is expensive and/or should be done as early as possible if timely
signaling is required.
