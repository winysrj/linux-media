Hi there,

My name is Shaobo He and I am a graduate student at University of Utah. 
I am applying a static analysis tool to the Linux device drivers, 
looking for NULL pointer dereference and accidentally found a plausible 
dead code location in v4l2-mem2mem.c due to undefined behavior.

The following is the problematic code segment 
(drivers/media/v4l2-core/v4l2-mem2mem.c),

> *m2m_ctx,
> 71                                                 enum v4l2_buf_type

> 75         else

> 77 }

> 81 {
> 82         struct v4l2_m2m_queue_ctx *q_ctx;
> 83
> 84         q_ctx = get_queue_ctx(m2m_ctx, type);
> 85         if (!q_ctx)
> 86                 return NULL;
> 87
> 88         return &q_ctx->q;
> 89 }

`get_queue_ctx` returns a pointer value that is an addition of the base 
pointer address (`m2m_ctx`) to a non-zero offset. The following is the 
definition of struct v4l2_m2m_ctx (include/media/v4l2-mem2mem.h),

> 94 struct v4l2_m2m_ctx {
> 95         /* optional cap/out vb2 queues lock */
> 96         struct mutex                    *q_lock;
> 97
> 98         /* internal use only */
> 99         struct v4l2_m2m_dev             *m2m_dev;

There is a NULL test in a caller of `get_queue_ctx` (line 85), which 
appears problematic to me. Iâ€™m not sure if it is defined or feasible 
under the context of Linux kernel. This blog 
(https://wdtz.org/undefined-behavior-in-binutils-causes-segfault.html) 
suggests that the NULL check can be optimized away because the only case 
that the return value can be NULL triggers pointer overflow, which is 
undefined.

Please let me know if it makes sense or not. Thanks for your time and I 
am looking forward to your reply.

Best,
Shaobo
