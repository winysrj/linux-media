   Yeah;  I'd spent so long trying to find a card with an s-video input 
that was likely to work without too much grief that I plain forgot that 
they don't all have the built-in encoder and didn't check it.

   S-video requirements are a dying breed, unfortunately.

   Don't suppose you know of any?  I see the Hauppauge HVR-2200 does, 
but it looks like the drivers for that are a bit too “fresh” for me to 
be able to risk another blind purchase (and may require kernel 3.2+, 
where I'm on SL6 with 2.6.~32).
