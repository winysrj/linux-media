I understand this. However, a complete JTAG state machine in the kernel, plus 
an Altera firmware parser, seems to be a lot of code that could live in 
userspace.

If I understand it correctly the driver assumes the firmware is in an Altera 
proprietary format. If we really want JTAG code in the kernel we should at 
least split the file parser and the TAP access code.
