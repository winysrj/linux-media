Ok, that DVB-C part was crap, there's no such tuner onboard. But there's
an analogue tuner onboard which seems to be recognized by the current
kernel:

[...]

But I have no video device listed under /dev.

Is there any information on the analogue tuner and how to get it working
or some information on how to start write a driver?
I would like to try to put something together - probably killing the
card. ;-)

Any help and information on that topic is appreciated!

Kind regards
Christoph
