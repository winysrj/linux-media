The ADV7611 was easy, it had a single HDMI input only. The ADV7612 is easy as 
well as it just has two separate HDMI inputs.

The ADV7604 is a more complex beast. The HDMI inputs shouldn't be much of an 
issue as they're independent and multiplexed internally. You can just create 
one pad per HDMI input.

The analog inputs, however, can't be modeled as easily. A naive approach would 
be to create one pad for each of the 12 analog inputs, but the chip has three 
separate ADCs and can combine 3 inputs in a single digital video stream. I 
don't know how we should model support for that. Lars-Peter, Hans, would you 
have a revolutionary idea to same the world today ?
