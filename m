Maybe, I was running latest Git. Not big issue.

Very easy to implement correctly. Attach tda10023 first and after that 
tda10048. Override tda10048 .i2c_gate_ctrl() with tda10023 
.i2c_gate_ctrl() immediately after tda10048 attach inside ttusb2.c. Now 
you have both demods (FEs) .i2c_gate_ctrl() which will control 
physically tda10023 I2C-gate as tuner is behind it.

I think that could be also avoided similarly overriding demod callbacks 
and adding some more logic inside ttusb2.c.

Proper fix that later problem is surely correct MFE support for 
DVB-USB-framework. I am now looking for it, lets see how difficult it 
will be.
