Hi Jim,

> I don't want to configure a RAID either, but if I purchase one SSD with
400 MB/sec write speeds, that might be good.

Hmm... nice idea.  Did you have any particular model in mind?  If you had a
link, I might be interested. I wouldn't know about sizing.  I don't know how
much space HD raw video takes up per hour, say.

On the other hand, maybe I could configure it to use the SSD for temporary
files while GStreamer did software compression.

Let me know what you think.

Regards

Steve
