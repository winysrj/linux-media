Not for an MC-centric device like the r-car or imx. It's why we have v4l-subdev
ioctls for the DV_TIMINGS API, but the corresponding SDTV standards API is
missing.

And in a complex scenario there is nothing preventing you from having multiple
SDTV inputs, some of which need PAL-BG, some SECAM, some NTSC (less likely)
which are all composed together (think security cameras or something like that).

You definitely cannot set the standard from a video device. If nothing else,
it would be completely inconsistent with how HDMI inputs work.

The whole point of MC centric devices is that you *don't* control subdevs
from video nodes.
