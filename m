I agree the core code should be generic, I was just mention OP-TEE to explain on
which context I'm working.

IOMMU interface doesn't offer API to manage buffer refcounting so you
will ignore
when you will have to stop protect the memory when using dma_buf you know
that the buffer is release when destroy function is called.
It is not only to not allow CPU to access to memory but also to
configure hardware
devices and firewall to be able to access to the memory.
