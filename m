Hi.

I tried loading the driver with polling disabled and it fails completely:

[ 5526.693563] mn88472 7-0018: downloading firmware from file
'dvb-demod-mn88472-02.fw'
[ 5527.032209] mn88472 7-0018: firmware download failed=-32
[ 5527.033864] rtl2832 7-0010: i2c reg write failed -32
[ 5527.033874] r820t 8-003a: r820t_write: i2c wr failed=-32 reg=05 len=1: 83
[ 5527.036014] rtl2832 7-0010: i2c reg write failed -32

I have no idea why the device behaves so counter-intuitively. Is there
maybe some sorf of internal power-save mode the device enters when
there is no i2c traffic for a while or something?
