List:

I'd like to send a couple of these cards to folks on this list, with
the hope that you might be interested in figuring out how to get it
running. I know it's got to be very similar to the existing Auvitek
8522, and appears to perhaps use some sort of Microtune tuner (since
Microtune actually acquired Auvitek).

I'm willing to buy two to send out. Who wants them?
