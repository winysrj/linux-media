This seems entirely bogus.

ENOICTLCMD is meant to be an entirely kernel-internal one, which is
meant to never be shown to user space. IOW, vfs_ioctl() turns it into
EINVAL (which I personally think is bogus - traditionally ENOTTY is
the right one for "not a valid ioctl", but there are people who
disagree - whatever)

The rationale for it is mainly as a way for layers inside the kernel
to determine the difference between "ioctl existed but failed with
EINVAL" vs "ioctl doesn't actually exist". Some layers try first one
thing and then another, and want to know the difference. An example of
that might be some code that first tries to call device-specific
version, and if that doesn't exist, do a generic emulation version.

Of course, as far as I can tell, almost nothing does that anyway.
Regardless, it's definitely wrong to document it as being returned to
user land. It should never be user-visible.
