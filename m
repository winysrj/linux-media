The S_STD call is hopelessly inadequate to deal with these types of
devices. What is needed is a new call that allows you to set the exact
timings you want: frame width/height, back/front porch, h/vsync width,
pixelclock. It is my opinion that the use of S_STD should be limited to
standard definition type inputs, and not used for other devices like
sensors or HD video.

Proposals for such a new ioctl are welcome :-)
