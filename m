Sarah,

Alas. I would suspect that I am one of the people most interested in the 
topic of dual-mode cameras, since I have worked on supporting them both in 
libgphoto2 and in the kernel. But I teach in a university for a living, 
and the first classes of Fall Semester 2011 start on August 17 in Auburn, 
Alabama. Knowing this, I decided, months ago, that I simply could not 
attend a conference which starts on August 16 in Vancouver.

So, after starting all of the current mailing-list discussion on the topic 
I will not be at the conference. I can only hope that those who do attend 
will keep me current about what gets discussed.
