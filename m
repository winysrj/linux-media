Well, initial report was made on vdr-portal because of our hardware announce,
but you can be sure the same is true if server is build on any linux hardware.
Here is some note:
http://www.vdr-portal.de/board18-vdr-hardware/board84-allgemein/106610-das-neue-netzwerk-client-der-f%C3%BCr-vdr-verwenden-k%C3%B6nnen/?highlight=vtuner

Additional info you can find (or ask) on our forum:
http://forum.nessiedvb.org/forum/viewforum.php?f=11

Please note, that compilation of vtunerc kernel driver (or loopback, or pigback
or whatever name the code should be used) is simple - no need for any
kernel real patching is required. Code can be compiled outside of the
kernel tree
(of course kernel headers are still needed).

Some useful hints regarding userland application daemons you
can find in our wiki:
http://wiki.nessiedvb.org/wiki/doku.php?id=vtuner_mode

When you get vtunerc and vtunerd applications connected, try
simple command line tuning (szap/tzap or czap) to check
if it works correctly. Only if you get zapping working switch
to vdr.
