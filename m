Subject: Re: [PATCH] FE_GET_PROPERTY should be _IOW, because the associated
 structure is transferred from userspace to kernelspace. Keep the old ioctl
 around for compatibility so that existing code is not broken.

Yes, that's what I meant to say ;) The workaround for it is there already,
so maybe there are other ioctl's using the wrong _IOC_ directions.

As I said before, some ioctl's don't use _IOC_ directions, like for example
the tty ioctls like TIO* ones. This happens on several very old drivers.
So, ioctl core don't make any assumption about them. it is up to each driver
(or subsystem core) to handle it.

I'm not against fixing it, but, in this case, we'll need to validate all DVB
ioctl's and remove the IOC_READ hack for all non-_OLD controls, and writing
a notice at features-to-be-removed announcing that the _OLD controls will be
removed.

Cheers,
Mauro.
