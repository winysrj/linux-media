Hi,

>  http://www.kernellabs.com/blog/?page_id=2066

Antti does some good stuff and he's always worth reading.

We do an incredible amount of Linux / V4L Driver video work at Kernel
Labs, often on very specialized hardware. We dig deep into the
hardware, bootloaders, embedded systems, fpgas, bus analyzers,
CableCard, logic analyzers etc. I wish we had more time in our day to
discuss and write about some of the projects we've worked on, or are
working on. This in fact was one of our original goals. I guess this
is my way of saying, sorry - I wish we had more time to help develop
the newbies into the V4L community.

That being said, thanks for mentioning our work.

Best,

- Steve
