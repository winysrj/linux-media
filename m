Unfortunately kbdrate affects all connected devices and I am not sure if
there is a utility allowing to set rate on individual devices. But here
is the main part: 

static int input_set_rate(int fd,
			  unsigned int delay, unsigned int period)
{
	unsigned int rep[2] = { delay, period };

	if (ioctl(fd, EVIOCSREP, rep) < 0) {
		perror("evdev ioctl");
		return -1;
	}
	return 0;
}
