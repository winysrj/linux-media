I am very pleased with the preceding 8 patches. That does exactly what I had
in mind. For this patch and the next (I would have combined those two into one
patch BTW) I want to do some testing first. Unfortunately due to travel I will
not have access to bttv hardware for the next 10 days or so.

One thing I am considering is adding some basic tuner-ownership functionality
to the v4l2 core. Without that I don't think we can ever get this working as
it should.

It might be an idea to make a pull request for the first 8 patches some time
next week. That's all good stuff and it makes the code much easier to
understand.

Regards,

	Hans
