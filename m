Hi,
I'm reading this list because I'm - like many others I guess - waiting for my 
EC168 based Sinovideo 3420b to be supported under linux. Now I've read this 
(https://www.dealextreme.com/forums/Default.dx/sku.8325~threadid.278942) post 
and was supprised that there already is some code that seems to be working 
for some other EC168 sticks. Sadly, it doesn't work for my device.
I want to thank Antti Palosaari for the work on the driver and suggest, that 
it should be communicated more clearly that there already is a code base for 
a driver.
Regards,
Jo
