Hi Mauro,

This pull request adds two tw686x drivers, one in mainline, one in staging.

We've ended up with two drivers: one only supports V4L2_FIELD_SEQ_BT,
FIELD_TOP and FIELD_BOTTOM interlaced modes and no audio, the other only
supports FIELD_INTERLACED by way of a memcpy and has audio support.

Part of the reason is weird hardware design that has different DMA modes
depending on the field settings. Krzysztof didn't need FIELD_INTERLACED,
so he never implemented that, and unfortunately when Ezequiel took his
code as starting point he only implemented the FIELD_INTERLACED format.
The memcpy was needed due to unstable DMA when using the DMA mode that
can do FIELD_INTERLACED. It is not known at this time if that unstable
behavior is specific to the hardware Ezequiel is using or if it is
inherent to the tw686x.

In the ideal world both feature sets should be merged into one driver.

But for now I decided to add Ezequiel's driver to the mainline and
Krzysztof's driver to staging. The reason for moving Ezequiel's driver
to mainline is that application support for FIELD_INTERLACED is standard,
whereas FIELD_TOP/BOTTOM/SEQ_BT is pretty rare. In addition, Ezequiel's
driver has audio support.

My hope is that someone will merge the feature sets and we can get rid
of one of the two drivers.

I have tested both drivers with this card:

(available on ebay)

Update: Ezequiel has started work to add the missing features to his
driver, so hopefully we'll be able to drop the staging driver in the near
future.li

Regards,

	Hans
