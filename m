I beg your pardon. So it is okay to remove the UVC-driver / plug the
cable and expect that things continue to work but removing the HCD is a
no no? I always assumed that kernel should BUG() no matter what the user
does unless he really begs for it. If there is a race then it is a bug
that deserves to be fixed, right?

either this or I would have the tree callers if the allocation succeded
or not in order not to take a reference if the allocation failed.

The UVC allocates the buffers once and reuses them. If a driver does
any kind of high-performance transfers and allocates new buffers on each
transfer then I would expect this kref_get() is in the noise area. But
if you want real numbers I would have to go ahead and test it.
A single get() on first allocation and its counter part on cleanup would
be enough if you are too concerned about it on every allocation (it
would be transparent to the user).
