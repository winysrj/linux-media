1. dma_sg can not be used, the DMA engine requires the memory blocks to be aligned on a factor of 
bytes per line, so 4K pages wouldn't work.

2.
I tried using videobuf-dma-contig, but got poor performance. I can not really explain why, I though 
it's due to the fact that the contiguous buffer is allocated coherent -> no caching.
I saw both gstreamer and mplayer perform very badly.
The frame grabber requires the DMA transfer for a frame beeing started while the frame is decoded. 
When I tested using contigous buffers gstreamer sometimes was that slow that it sometimes missed to 
have a frame queued when a transfer was finished, so I got frame drops. Any other ideas of the poor 
performance? otherwise I would like to go for the double buffered solution.

Thanks
