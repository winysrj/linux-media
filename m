Well, the old linux-dvb list forwards all messages to the new list, so
no information is actually lost.  However, this does often result in
multiple posts with the same content, since the auto-reply message
sent back to users posting to linux-dvb often leads them to think the
message wasn't delivered.

That said, I think enough time has gone by where we can finally just
drop the linux-dvb mailing list.
