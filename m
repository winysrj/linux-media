I'll likely be able to attend too. ATM I'm working on camera support in 
Android. I think Hans discussed related topics at the previous summit in 
the US too, which I didn't manage to attend unfortunately. I'll try to 
double-check results of those discussions and see which topics I'd be 
interested in discussing further.

On a related note, since I live something like 80km from the venue, I was 
thinking about possibly helping to organise a media event in my town - in 
Aachen, or in Düsseldorf itself or in neighbouring Cologne (Köln). Let me 
know if there's interest. We could use Saturday the 18th of October for 
that.

Thanks
Guennadi
