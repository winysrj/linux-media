Hello all,
Just a quick question to everyone is anyone writing a driver for
WinTV-NOVA-S-USB2? It seems to be made up from already supported
devices so the driver looks straight forward. I'm happy to dive in and
give it a go as long as I'm not treading on any ones toes :)

I see someone wrote the wiki page for the device
(http://www.linuxtv.org/wiki/index.php/Hauppauge_WinTV-NOVA-S-USB2) so
I was wondering if anyone got any further?

(I've done C coding for 16 years, this won't be my first kernel
driver, but will be my first Linux kernel driver)
