This looks like a respect email. Best would have been if Manu wouldn't
have had released
any code and would just have forwarded his code to his friends they
wouldn't have complained and
even probably would have paid some beer and invited him for some parties.
It takes time to get documentation for a certain chip, to get the
agreement for it and finally to write
a driver for it. As user it's certainly easier to complain about all
that and think that everything's free.
Even google is playing around with the content of the mails I send
here and earning money by doing
statistics out of that.
