This was exactly the approach I had in mind when I suggested using 
indexes.

I don't think the assymetry is really a problem. As I see it, there are 
basically two user cases:

1) Userspace wants scancode X to generate keypress Y
   (In which case userspace doesn't care one iota what the index is)

2) Userspace wants to get the current keytable from the kernel
   (In which case a loop with an index from 0 to n is appropriate)

and, possibly:

3) Userspace wants to know what keycode (if any) scancode X generates
   (In which case approach 2 will work just as well, but this usecase
    seems a bit contrived anyway...)
