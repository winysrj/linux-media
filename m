I am new to Linux (somewhat) and I am running Linux mint 9. So far so
good, I have replaced dreamweaver with NVU, office with open office.
Outlook with evolution and so on. Everything is now perfect no looking
back to windows except I just spent about 1.5 hours going through
configuring mythtv only to find it doesn't think my pinnacle usb hd
stick is a dvb device. So i did more research and stumbled upon all of
your hard work and tried downloading the tar for my device but it
wouldn't download. 2 questions 1) will this device work now 2) how do I
implement all of you fixes in mint Linux 9 gnome running mythtv?

thanks for any help
Ray
