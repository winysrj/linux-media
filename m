Ok.

Sounds good, I like that.

Fair enough. In cases like this, it's often good to add a TODO section
to the patch description, or a FIXME comment in the patch itself.

Please explain the exact requirements that lead you to defining multiple
contexts. My feeling is that in most cases we don't need them and can
simply live with a single area. Depending on how obscure the cases are
where we do need something beyond that, we can then come up with
special-case solutions for them.

Of course not. But we need to know what we want a platform with device
tree support to look like when it's using CMA, so we don't make it
harder to change the platforms over than it already is.

The problem with defining CMA areas in the device tree is that it's not
a property of the hardware, but really policy. The device tree file
should not contain anything related to a specific operating system
because you might want to boot something on the board that doesn't
know about CMA, and even when you only care about using Linux, the
implementation might change to the point where hardcoded CMA areas
no longer make sense.

IMHO we should first aim for a solution that works almost everywhere
without the kernel knowing what board it's running on, and then we
can add quirks for devices that have special requirements. I think
the situation is similar to the vmalloc virtual address space, which
normally has a hardcoded size that works almost everywhere, but there
are certain drivers etc that require much more, or there are situations
where you want to make it smaller in order to avoid highmem.
