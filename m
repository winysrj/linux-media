Surely this is possible and it will resolve power drain issue. But it is 
not nice looking and causes more deviation compared to others.

Could you add configuration option "bool do_not_powerdown_on_attach" ?

I have quite many tda18271 devices here and all those are DVB onlyÌ£ (OK, 
PCTV 520e is DVB + analog, but analog is not supported). Having 
configuration parameter sounds like better plan.
