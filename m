only a guess, but did you add the vchiq node to the device tree?

vchiq: vchiq@7e00b840 {
    compatible = "brcm,bcm2835-vchiq";
    reg = <0x7e00b840 0xf>;
    interrupts = <0 2>;
    cache-line-size = <32>;
    firmware = <&firmware>;
};

For a Raspberry Pi 3 you will need cache-line-size to be 64.

Stefan
