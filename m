It is a design flaw in many subsystems having providers and consumers,
not only GPIO. The same situation is with clock providers, regulators,
phys, drm_panels, ..., at least it was such last time I have tested it.

The problem is that many frameworks assumes that lifetime of provider is
always bigger than lifetime of its consumers, and this is wrong
assumption - usually it is not possible to prevent unbinding driver from
device, so if the device is a provider there is no way to inform
consumers about his removal.

Some solution for such problems is to use some kind of availability
callbacks for requesting resources (gpios, clocks, regulators,...)
instead of simple 'getters' (clk_get, gpiod_get). Callbacks should
guarantee that the resource is always valid between callback reporting
its availability and callback reporting its removal. Such approach seems
to be complicated at the first sight but it should allow to make the
code safe and as a bonus it will allow to avoid deferred probing.
Btw I have send already RFC for such framework [1].
