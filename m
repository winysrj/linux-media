Hmm... I don't like very much to mangle the summary of a meeting with
something that were discussed after that at the ML, as one of the meeting's
results. Especially since that is just a draft which might even not be the
final one.

Also, in this specific case, I can't see much value on adding such info,
as the meeting report already points that such document will be discussed
and elaborated at the ML and later added at kernel's Documentation,
even pointing to the place at docs where it will likely be.

Cheers,
Mauro
