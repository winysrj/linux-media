Well, but thanks to all the self-import and re-import checks, it's
_impossible_ to import the same dma_buf twice without noticing (presuming
both importer and exporter are drm devices).

See above, if you have two different struct file * for the same underlying
buffer object something is wrong already.

Well, we also have code in drm prime for that case - if the same dma_buf
object shows up multiple times, we'll only import it once. For the second
import we'll return the already created drm_gem object from the first
import, but with the refcount incremented.

I think if you have drm prime drivers both as importers and exporters, it
is already fixed. It is correct though that both importer and exporter
need a bit of code to take care and not accidentally duplicate a shared
object somehow.

But since you've proposed your rfc as part of the drm subsystem I've
figured that we don't need to discuss the duplicate import handling code.

Yours, Daniel
