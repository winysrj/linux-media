Daniel,

Thanks for your input. I think this is mostly orthogonal to dma_buf, and
really a way to adapt TTM to be DMA-api aware. That's currently done
within the TTM backends. CMA was mearly included as an example that
might not be relevant.

I haven't followed dma_buf that closely lately, but if it's growing from 
being just
a way to share buffer objects between devices to something providing 
also low-level
allocators with fragmentation prevention, there's definitely an overlap.
However, on the dma_buf meeting in Budapest there seemed to be little or 
no interest
in robust buffer allocation / fragmentation prevention although I 
remember bringing
it up to the point where I felt annoying :).

A good point, I didn't think of that.

For TTM drivers sharing the same IOMMU it's really possible to make such 
LRU global,
(assuming IOMMU identity is available to the TTM-aware drivers), but unless
fragmentation prevention the way we use it for graphics drivers 
(allocate - submit - fence) ends
up in the IOMMU space management code, it's impossible to make this 
scheme system-wide.
