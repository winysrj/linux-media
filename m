Hello

The DVB-T2 USB stick appears to be in stock in the UK.

Product page:
http://www.pctvsystems.com/Products/ProductsEuropeAsia/Digitalproducts/PCTVnanoStickT2/tabid/248/language/en-GB/Default.aspx

Play.com, Dabs and Amzon.co.uk list it as in stock.

Is there any work started on a driver at this point?

If no work has started, would a loan/donation of a stick help?

What can be done to trigger/accelerate the provision of a driver?

Nico
