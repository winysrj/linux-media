0.8.2 is the new version that was released in Jan, 25. One of the major
differences is that it now installs the udev rules, with make install.

This is there in order to prepare to the removal of all those in-kernel
Remote Controller tables.

On my tests here, this is working fine, with Fedora and RHEL 6, on my
usual test devices, so I don't believe that the tool itself is broken, 
nor I think that the issue is due to the fix patch.

I remember that when Kay added a persistence utility tool that opens a V4L
device in order to read some capabilities, this caused a race condition
into a number of drivers that use to register the video device too early.
The result is that udev were opening the device before the end of the
register process, causing OOPS and other problems.

I suspect that Mark may be experiencing a similar issue.

I don't think that most of the c/c will be able to help with this issue.
So, I think that the better is if Mark could either open a Buzgilla or
send me and linux-media the dmesg logs and other information that he may
have about what's happening. It would be interesting if he can remove the
udev rule, boot it and run the udev command manually, to see if this is
really a race condition or something else. If it fails manually, the
better is to activate ftrace logs for rc-core and for the driver functions
and send us the trace logs.

Thanks,
Mauro
