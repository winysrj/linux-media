That's also been my understanding in the past.

As the copyright owner I'm legally entitled to generate a separate 
license for the code I originally merged into Linus's tree, though - 
correct? (Perhaps not any updates that were subsequently made to that 
code by the community).

I guess this is would be seen legally as two pieces of code with two 
distinct licenses, not a dual license... or maybe I'm splitting hairs.

Regardless, it will be an interest exercise to review the proposed dual 
license, even if nothing good can come from it.
