Right, but on some systems it does auto-mount, and even if it does not
auto-mount and the user then just clicks on its icon in the filemanager
to look at the photo's it will mount, and it will be non obvious to the
user to umount it.

Once mounted, the /dev/video# node will be gone. So if for example skype
gets started it will say the user has no camera. If it were to say the device
is busy, the user just might make a link to the mounted gvfs share, but even
then that is a big might.

The whole disappear / reappear act of the /dev/video# node is one of my
concerns with the current solution.

Then you've a bug in your libgphoto2, Fedora had a similar bug which I fixed
(and send the fix upstream). libgphoto2 now a days does make the call to
re-attach the kernel driver.

Right, so my plan is to define busy for stillcam mode as not being in
the middle of some operation (be it download or delete).

Actually this one is easy. Most streaming drivers already handle controls
while not streaming by remembering the set values, and these cached values
usually then get set on stream start. There are multiple reasons for
this:
- usb transfers are expensive no need to send a value to the device
   if it may change before it gets actually used
- in many cases parts of the device are powered down when not streaming,
   so sending values while not streaming just drops them in a black hole

Agreed.

I've been subscribed to the libgphoto2-devel list for quite some time now,
I believe I still have to see the first win32 / OS-X user input. We do get
occasional FreeBSD input, usually in the form of "it no longer compiles".

I'm not saying that portability is not important, but contributions
from users on other platforms should not be overrated either.
