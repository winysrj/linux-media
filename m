I am new to video for linux and would like to know what resources are 
available to assist me in programming a simple webcam application with 
c++ in a *nix environment. My main goal right now is to just view the 
webcam in a small window. I have found lots of info on driver 
development, but I am interested in the application side. Are there any 
c++ examples or references that will help me get started?

Thanks
