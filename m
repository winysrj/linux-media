Just waiting until every task already holding a lock completes and
unlucks it is indeed a viable solution - it's the currently
implemented algorithm in ttm and Maarten's current patches.

The nice thing with Peter's wakeup idea on top is:
- It bounds blocked times.
- And (at least I think so) it's the key thing making PI boosting
possible without any ugly PI inversion deadlocks happening. See

for my current reasoning about this (I have not yet managed to poke a
hole into it).
