Hiya,

I've been reading this mailing list with regards to using a USB CI, but
hadn't found anything to help until I found the posts from Luc and Steve
sometime ago about getting the WinTV-CI to work under Linux.

Coincidently, at the end of last year I had e-mailed Luc about the
WinTV-CI, to see if I can help.
I'm in the process of purchasing some hardware to start testing.

He had managed to grab the firmware from the Windows driver but had so
far been unable to get it to load correctly in his new driver.


Regards,

Ian Wilkinson
