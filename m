And it makes the code more maintainable, and helps sparse doing a lot of
checking for us. I guess
we can tolerate a couple of extra barriers for that.

Hmm. yes, probably. At least in the replace function. I think if we do
it in other places, we should add comments as to where
the smp_wmb() is located, for future reference.


Also  I saw in a couple of places where you're checking the shared
pointers, you're not checking for NULL pointers, which I guess may
happen if shared_count and pointers are not in full sync?
