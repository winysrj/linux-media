Hey Andy, thanks for your review,  adding Hyong-Youb Kim for  review of the
full range ioremap_wc() idea below.

I suspected this and its why I note that a rewrite to address a clean
split with separate ioremap seems rather difficult in this case.

Worst case concern I have also is the implications of having overlapping
ioremap() calls (as proposed in my last reply) for different memory types
and having the different virtual memory addresse used by different parts
of the driver. Its not clear to me what the hardware implications of this
are.

Using overlapping ioremap() calls with different memory types would address
this concern provided hardware won't barf both on the device and CPU. Hardware
folks could provide feedback or an ivtvfb user could test the patch supplied
on both non-PAT and PAT systems. Even so, who knows,  this might work on some
systems while not on others, only hardware folks would know.

An alternative... is to just ioremap_wc() the entire region, including
MMIO registers for these old devices. I see one ethernet driver that does
this, myri10ge, and am curious how and why they ended up deciding this
and if they have run into any issues. I wonder if this is a reasonable
comrpomise for these 2 remaining corner cases.

  Luis
