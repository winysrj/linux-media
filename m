I reviewed the core MM changes and I've acked most of them so the
next release should have a few acks where you expect them. I did not
add a reviewed-by because I did not build and test the thing.

For me, Patch 2 is the only one that must be fixed prior to merging
as it can interfere with pages on a remote per-cpu list which is
dangerous. I know your suggestion will be to delete the per-cpu lists
and be done with it but I am a bit away from doing that just yet.

Patch 8 could do with a bit more care too but it is not a
potential hand grenade like patch 2 and could be fixed as part of
a follow-up. Even if you don't see an ack from me there, it should not
be treated as a show stopper.

I highlighted some issues on how CMA interacts with reclaim but I
think this is a problem specific to CMA and should not prevent it being
merged. I just wanted to be sure that the CMA people were aware of the
potential issues so they will recognise the class of bug if it occurs.

FWIW, the acks I put on the core MM changes are real acks :)

I'm a lot happier with the core MM patches than I was when I reviewed
this first around last September or October.
