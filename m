What I propose is quite near what Klaus wants. Just only new simple ways 
to report current statistics with beforehand scale/values.

1) Signal Strength
* linear scale 0-0xffff

2) Quality SNR
* SNR in resolution 0.1dB

3) Quality BER
* ~like currently (no exact units)
* measured from inner coding

4) Quality UCB
* ~like currently (no exact units)
* measured from outer coding (naturally)
* counter is increased over lifetime
* tune resets counter?
* driver is responsible of polling statistic in background and report 
from cache


I would not like to define exact units for BER and USB as those are 
quite hard to implement and also non-sense. User would like just to see 
if there is some (random) numbers and if those numbers are rising or 
reducing when he changes antenna or adjusts gain. We are not making a 
professional signal analyzers - numbers does not need to be 100% correctly.

ISDB-T statistics are forced also to that simple API. Calculating 
average value for example. Statistic differences between layers are so 
minor that users does not even care to know.

And as there is some persons who surely like to do QoS API like need of 
$10k professional equipment, I propose to add more accurate reports as 
alternative BUT that minimalist API should be offered even professional 
API exits.
