The patch you submitted lacked all register setup so there wasn't that much
to test without the stuff I added in the third patch in this
series.

Is there any way to accnowledge this when I reply to your patch with tested-by?
Should I maybe add the third patch in this series into that reply?

Also, when I post the next RFC for my smi2021 driver that
depends on this patch. Are there any correct way to mention that
dependency in the smi2021 patch?

Best,
