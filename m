Thanks Marek.

  Yep, that is what I did and it worked just fine for me on Ubuntu.  I
was just wondering where the .c files were for the precompiled .o's that
those scripts are moving around.  Then after posting I realized I just
wasnt' looking hard enough.. I think all the source is in the tarball
and I just need to get the kernel source to compile.  So in the end, my
fault for not looking before typing.

Still hoping that Christian will put the bb-demux code up somewhere so
can start playing with it.
