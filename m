I need to capture composite video.

Well, what I really need is a wireless video feed from a power wheels
car.  So the car side should be cheap (I am expecting it to get
broken) small, somewhat rugged (so it doesn't get broken sooner.)
don't care much at all about quality - I am thinking of this:

$30 - Mini Wireless Color Camera with Microphone

Now I just need something to capture the composite and audio.

I would prefer usb so it can be used with a laptop, but a PCIe card
isn't out of the question.

There is a chance I will have 4 of these going currently, so if there
is a single device that takes 4 inputs, that would be nice.
