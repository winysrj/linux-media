Resending, now making sure I use plain text for the email...

I did indeed look at this at the time. I still have the hardware,
should have the hardware docs somewhere, and can look at where I left
that hacked code at the time...

I really would have liked to merge in the support for it into
winbond-cir, but real life took over.

As I said, I still have the hardware around. I might get some time
around this weekend to look at it and come back with at least an idea
of what is left to be done.

Best regards,

   Juan.
