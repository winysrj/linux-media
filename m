Hello all,

I'm currently working on an automated process to increase the 
number of online Closed Captions for the hearing-impaired 
community on a popular video-streaming service. I've had a 
successful proof-of-concept on mac and PC platforms, but to 
take this process to scale, I'd like to design a linux 
solution.

The device I'm currently using is the AverTVHD Volar Max 
(h286DU). I've attempted to use the Aver-supplied drivers in 
Ubuntu 10.4 and 9.10 to no avail. Any help in developing a 
working driver / installation method for my device would be 
greatly appreciated by me, and, potentially, a very large and 
very under-represented audience of hard-of-hearing.

Thanks for any support in this matter, and for all the 
development done up to this point.

Andy
