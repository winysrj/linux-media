	Hello,

Trying to use USERPTR buffers with UVC, user space gets stuck either in 
poll(POLLIN) or in ioctl(VIDIOC_DQBUF). It seems the UVC driver never ever 
returns a frame in USERPTR mode. The symptoms are identical with kernel 
versions 3.6, 3.7 and 3.8. I also tested 3.2, but it did not support USERPTR.

Tested hardware was Logitech HD Pro Webcam C920 with YUY2 pixel format. The 
same hardware and the same driver work fine with MMAP buffers.
The same USERPTR userspace code works fine with the vivi test device...

Did any have any better luck?
