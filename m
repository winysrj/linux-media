Hi,=0A=0AI could imagine it's not a welcome question but I'm looking for a =
new DVB-T / Composite Analog TV cardbus card or usb card and I'm writing he=
re to ask for your experiences with such cards on Ubuntu 8.04. Currently I =
own an AVerMedia E506R yet whatever I did with whoevers help, I didn't get =
it to run properly on Ubuntu 8.04 and I'm against risking my otherwise perf=
ect installation with a vanilla kernel as I've got not much Linux experienc=
e. Problems with my E506R: sometimes it gets powered on on boot, sometimes =
it doesn't. If it gets powered on, tvtimes video is vertically wavy. There =
is no sound due to saa7134-alsa troubles. I'm using mrecs experimental dvb-=
t driver.=0A=0AThus: what's your experience with hybrid tv cards under Ubun=
tu 8.04? Which work out-of-the-box, which require a new v4l-dvb package and=
 which require some else fiddling ?=0A=0AThanks for your help!=0A=0ALars=0A=
=0A=0AP.s.: I sent this message 5 hours ago but it doesn't appear to have c=
ome through (it's my first message to this list)=0A=0ASend instant messages=
