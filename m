I have got today device having this chip (thanks to verkkokauppa.com for 
sponsoring) and I am going to implement the driver. I am in hope I can 
share some code from the old RTL2831U chip driver. I haven't looked 
driver code yet nor taken any sniffs. I will do that during next week.

Anyhow, there is Realtek released driver spreading over the net for that 
chip, you can use it.
