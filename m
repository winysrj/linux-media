Hi all,

just found out that these cards have finally some preliminary Linux
support. They seem quite versatile and even customizable -- a true gift
for dedicated hobbyists. :) PCI/PCIe/AGP or floppy drive mounting and
firewire /connection/ chaining look especially interesting. Even
FloppyDTV is apparently half internal, half external - sort of. Anybody
with hands-on access? Any updates? Share your experience! :o)
