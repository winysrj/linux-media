Well, this is a valuable outcome in my book. Maybe seeing the actual amount=
 of
modifications necessary for cleaning up clientdata helped the process. While
working on it, I also got the impression that it should be handled differen=
tly
in the future, of course. Although I was thinking of something different
('i2c_(allocate|free)_clientdata' as mentioned before), I prefer the above
proposal as it is most simple.

Fine with me. Let me know if I can assist you with the series.
