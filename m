Hi,
I have also TT-3200 and would like to have driver which are not able
to burn anything, but to WORK as they should. I am currently using
liplianindvb repository, because it seems only one working with my
card. To bad that they have code which "can burn demodulator" in some
case, as i don't wanna that. Well till now i have had luck then seems
so, but....
I can use multiproto driver to but they should work OK with tt-3200 (i
can test them to if needed) have only Astra 19.2E and Hotbird 13.0.

There should be also respect to ppl who build driver and stuff we are
using, and Thank to them.
