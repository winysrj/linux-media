Yeah, that's one of the most popular mistakes in the technical world.
Decibel is a relative unit. X dB says nothing about the absolute value
without a reference value.
Hence these reference values must be specified in the document.
Otherwise the reported signal strengths are meaningless / not comparable.

It might be worth to take a look at what the wireles network people have
done.
IIRC, they had the same discussion about signal strength reporting a
(longer) while ago.

Just my two cents.
