I am not sure. We can still correctly parse the endpoint properties of a
parentless node. All current users ignore the return value anyway. So as
long as we still do the memset and and set local_node and id, returning
an error effectively won't change the current behaviour.

Indeed. I see no problem in adding an of_graph_get_next_port function.
But I'd like to keep the current of_graph_get_next_endpoint function
iterating over all endpoints of the device.

And I fear that this series might outgrow maintainer attention spans if
I keep adding to it.

Thanks. How about I follow this up with a split port/endpoint parsing
helpers after I get some acks?

I'd prefer this to be a generic function of_get_next_child_by_name and
possibly a macro for_each_named_child_of_node wrapping that.

The main difference I see is that a single IPU device will have two port
nodes handled by the DRM driver and two port nodes handled by the V4L2
driver, so we can't go back up to the IPU device tree node and iterate
over all its ports in either the DRM or V4L2 drivers.
You could argue that all the device tree parsing should be done from the
IPU drivers, and the DRM and V4L2 drivers should use preparsed internal
graph structures. But then we are getting into using struct media_entity
in DRM drivers territory, and rather not go there right now.

Philipp
