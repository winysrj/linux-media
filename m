Well, of course you're right - at the moment, no mechanism to do so.
That will certainly be the next step - we could discuss it sometime
this week at LPC to see what makes better sense.

I am not sure I understand how having a .phys makes it more difficult
- and also, for cases where you're sharing buffers between CPU and a
co-processor like DSP, my understanding is that we'd need an
equivalent of a phys address.
