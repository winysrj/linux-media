True.

Interpret "trailing silence" above as "silence long enough to indicate 
end of message" :)

No, but it would still be nice not to interpret a NEC48 signal as NEC32.

IIRC, no.

Another alternative is fix the driver to implement a timeout so that 
"unreasonable" values are not generated (I saw a 240550us space in your 
log).

That's basically what the filtering version of the raw interface does 
(cf. the use of dev->timeout in ir_raw_event_store_with_filter()).

And it's what most of the popular hardware does. For instance, the 
mceusb hardware will send a USB packet with timings including that 
trailing silence. And the decoder can only do their work once a packet 
has arrived (which will contain a number of samples). That also 
demonstrates a potential problem with your suggested approach (i.e. 
timings can be buffered so calls to the decoders are not necessarily 
"real-time").

Which driver?

Agreed...
