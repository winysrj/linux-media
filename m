Ugh, damn, that change broke the ffdc device auto-detection... Better than a crash, but lemme see if I can alter things slightly so we can have our cake and eat it too...

Yep. I hate hate hate hate the ffdc imon hardware, for this and multiple other reasons (including the nasty hack used for ffdc device type auto-detection)... My ffdc devices do similar constant spewing, but never triggered the oops, so maybe yours is even worse, or your system is faster, or a kernel config change made a difference here...

Thanks for the testing and patience, hopefully just one more patch to test out before we can say case closed here...
