There's no reason the phy_address things have to be arrays.  A separate
individual pointer for each PHY would work just as well.

If everybody agrees DT has a nice scheme for specifying relations
between devices, why not use that same scheme in the PHY core?

The phy_address things don't have to be defined or allocated in the 
board file; they could be set up along with the platform data.

In any case, this was simply meant to be a suggestion to show that it 
is relatively easy to do what you need without using name or ID 
strings.
