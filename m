Come to think of it, since the generic "one-size-fits-all"
configuration leaves the loop thru and xtal output enabled, it should
be safe to go to the lowest power level allowed (based on the
configuration) at the end of the attach() function.  I'll put up a
patch within the next few days...  Thanks for noticing this, Antti.

We wont need to add any new configuration option :-)
