Can you please provide pointers to what you're referring to?  The only
code that I could find that created platform devices prefixed with
'timb-' or named 'xilinx_spi' was drivers/mfd/timberdale.c.

It would break mfd_clone_cell, as it uses mfd_get_cell to grab the one
to clone.  We could change it to accept the cell as an argument.  It
would also break mfd_cell_enable/disable, of course.
