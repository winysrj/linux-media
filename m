How does one find out what is left to be done with the above project.

I have been following http://jusst.de/hg/saa716x closely and it's
getting there the work that Manu A is heading up is awesome keep up
the good work.

I just wanted to know where you were at with the driver\s what is left
to be done? because I may be able to offer some assistance if
required...I’ll see what I can do anyway to get done and across the
line.

Thanks.
