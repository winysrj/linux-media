Thanks.
But gmane returns a wrong information then

================================================================================
You have sent a message to be posted on the
gmane.linux.drivers.video-input-infrastructure newsgroup.


This is a non-public mailing list, which means that you have to
subscribe to the list to post to it.  If you're already subscribed to
the list, Gmane can forward the message you sent to the list if you respond
to this message.  If not, you should sign up to the mailing list first,
and then respond to this message, or just forget about it.

Many mailing lists have an option to subscribe to a list, but then put
it in 'nomail' mode, which means that you won't receive any mail from
the list.

The mailing list software used for the list in question is majordomo.


Mail majordomo@vger.kernel.org and say 'subscribe linux-media'.
You have to respond within one week.
