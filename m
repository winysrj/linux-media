Which is, indeed, what one finds by pointing a browser at www.radix.net;
that mailbox belongs to his old ISP, and presumably he doesn't want to keep
paying them for it.

It might be worth your while, though, Andy, as active as you are in the
development community (and thanks again for it) to ask them if they'd forward
that address for a while, for a nominal charge...  I used to do it, when I 
ran a small dialup ISP...
