And that's why it is in staging. Should a long TODO list now suddenly
prevent staging from being used? In Barcelona we discussed this and the
only requirement we came up was was that it should compile.

Having two competing drivers for the same hardware are hardly new. We've
had our share of those in the past, so I fail to see why this is suddenly
a problem or why that should prevent this driver from being merged in staging.

So once the driver is ready to be moved from staging to drivers/media, then
we can choose to keep the old driver around for awhile and let the user
make the choice which to use.

It's a staging driver. So you know it will need more work and that it isn't
perfect. It's independent of any core kernel code, so it won't affect anything
else. I don't see why the size of the staging driver should matter in deciding
whether or not to include it. Nor do I see any reason why letting it linger
in linux-next for a few weeks should improve it in any way since we know it
has issues as it is in staging. I understand why linux-next is useful when
it comes to core code, but in this case it just seems to introduce a second
merge window before the 'real' merge window.

This is getting ridiculous in my opinion, not to mention discouraging for
developers. Staging is supposed to be fairly easy to get into (and out of,
if you don't continue development), but now I see all sorts of hurdles being
thrown up.

This driver has been in development for ages, it has seen quite a bit of
review resulting in the TODO list. I believe it's time to get this into
staging. If no further development takes place, then we just kick it out
in 6 months or so, no harm done.
