One solution would be to convert CONFIG_VIDEO_SAA7134_RC into a module,
and change its Kconfig item to tri-state. This way, everything should work
properly.

It is not that hard to convert it to be a module. Like the approach it
was taken for saa7134-alsa and saa7134-dvb, but this would require to move
the IR init code from saa7134 into saa7134-rc, as the -rc module will be
initialized late, and asynchronous.

Unfortunately, I don't have any time soon for doing that. Perhaps an easier
way would be to disable CONFIG_VIDEO_SAA7134_RC if RC_CORE=m and SAA7134=y.

Cheers,
Mauro
