Hmmm.

The soc_camera framework supports automatic negotiation
for some type of option.
But it doesn't include board configuration.

When board doesn't support Field ID signal,
we will have to modify driver though camera and host support it. 

This is the reason.

I think bus width and field ID are depend on board configuration.
# May be camera strobe. but I'm not sure
