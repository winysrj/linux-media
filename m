Hermann,

If you have suggestions to improve patchwork, please forward it to the right list:
	https://ozlabs.org/mailman/listinfo/patchwork

I'm not the maintainer of it, so all I can do is to propose some code just like
any other.

I'm not sure what you're meaning by "reject message". If what you want is that
patchwork would generate a reject message if it can't found a patch on an
email, this won't work, since it will send a message to every message that
doesn't contain a patch.

Although I've already proposed a few patches to patchwork, I don't have deep
knowledge about its internals. As far as I understand, patchwork has a logic to
detect if an email has a patch. If it doesn't detect a patch, it do nothing.

Probably, the logic it uses is similar to the logic at diffstat. So, if a patch
got mangled by line-wrap, the logic won't be able to detect it as a patch.

Patchwork works fine if the patch is sent via the official, recommended way:
send a patch in-lined.

Send a patch enclosed as an attachment is evil, since it is harder for
developers to comment about the patch, especially if they are using some
text-mode emailer like mutt and pine (those are very frequent among kernel
hackers).

Yet, it tries to do its best to analyze an attachment and checks for a patch.
In order to do that, it analyzes the applicable mime types for a text that can
contain a patch:
	text/x-patch
	text/x-diff

It also provides a fallback method of analyzing pure text attachments
(text/plain) for those email software that are broken enough to not recognize a
patch.

It makes no sense to analyze any other mime type since what would be the
sense of having a patch inside a gif picture, an openoffice doc or a binary
application?

So, it properly discards any other type of documents.

What happened with Miroslav's email is that the email software he is using
is so broken that it can't even recognize a patch as a text! It thinks that the
patch is a binary application (application/octet-stream), as
pointed by CityK, and even encodes it with base64.

This is what you see if you open the source code of his email:

...
X-Mailer: Centrum Mail 5.0
...
Content-Type: application/octet-stream; name="leadtek_winfast_dtv1800h.patch"
Content-Transfer-Encoding: base64

QWRkcyBzdXBwb3J0IGZvciBMZWFkdGVrIFdpbkZhc3QgRFRWLTE4MDBICgpGcm9tOiBNaXJv
c2xhdiBTdXN0ZWsgPHN1c3RtaWRvd25AY2VudHJ1bS5jej4KCkVuYWJsZXMgYW5hbG9nL2Rp
...

The proper approach here is to complain with the email software provider
(Centrum Mail?) for they to fix their software to not mark a patch as if it
where an application, and to send patches as inlined.

That's said, the default behavior configured on several listservers and on list
mirrors is to deny any email with application/octet-stream mime type, to avoid
that someone could use a list or a web server as a place to store trojan horses. 

So, nobody should use an emailer that encodes an attachment as
application/octet-stream for sending such emails to a public ML.



Cheers,
Mauro
