The links are available in each of the spots enums were replaced. In
many cases they already existed so I haven't added new ones in that
case. The typical from I've used is "See <xref linkend="enum" />." This
could be mentioned to have more direct relation to the enum.

In many cases the IOCTL documentation itself specifies the valid values.
Especially in those cases the enum should be given as reference only.
Perhaps it'll also make sense to revisit these places where e.g. only
some buffer types are mentioned to be valid in a context of an IOCTL,
but this is out of the scope of this patch IMO.

These ones I simply forgot. I'll fix this and repost.
