Thanks for your reply !
I have a Terratec Cinergy 200 USB, too, and I used this device for
testing the code.
You are right, the Windows driver never transfers more than 4 bytes
(verified with USB-logs).
Do you know if there is something like a control flag for non-stopping
i2c transfers ?

Maybe you also noticed the following tread:
http://www.spinics.net/lists/linux-media/msg57442.html

Do you remember any details about your device ?
One thing not mentioned in this tread is, that there seem to be multiple
chip IDs for the EM2800.
The em28xx only knows about ID=7 and I assume that's what you device
uses. But the chip in my device uses ID=4...

Regards,
Frank
