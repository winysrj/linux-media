Hi Dear, my name is Jack and i am seeking for a relationship in which i will feel loved after a series of failed relationships. 

I am hoping that you would be interested and we could possibly get to know each other more if you do not mind. I am open to answering questions from you as i think my approach is a little inappropriate. Hope to hear back from you.

Jack.
