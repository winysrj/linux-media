Hello Bastian,
     I'm currently working with an ov5642 device, and I saw your patch
to add controls from last September:
http://patchwork.linuxtv.org/patch/7786/.  Has there been any movement
on this patch since then?  I haven't found anything in my searches,
but I may just have missed it.
     If there hasn't been any movement, are you planning on
re-submitting the patch?  If not, I probably have some time to update
it (if necessary), test it, and re-submit, but I didn't want to do so
before consulting with you.

Thanks,
Chris Lalancette
