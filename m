That's correct.

I don't think this multiple process use case is valid. The V4L2 streaming API 
wasn't designed to be used in a multi-thread or multi-process context in the 
first place.

I don't agree. If we did that, buffers couldn't be released after a STREAMOFF. 
Queued buffers belong to the driver, so to free the buffers applications would 
have to call VIDIOC_STREAMOFF and then dequeue all buffers. That's not pretty.
