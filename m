Not really. To being with, you cannot determine any meaning of a node
across the tree (aside from it being an endpoint) without also
understanding the binding that the node is a part of. That means you
need to have something matching against the compatible string on both
ends of the linkage. For instance:

panel {
	compatible = "acme,lvds-panel";
	lvds-port: port {
	};
};

display-controller {
	compatible = "encom,video";
	port {
		remote-endpoint = <&lvds-port>;
	};
};

In the above example, the encom,video driver has absolutely zero
information about what the acme,lvds-panel binding actually implements.
There needs to be both a driver for the "acme,lvds-panel" binding and
one for the "encom,video" binding (even if the acme,lvds-panel binding
is very thin and defers the functionality to the video controller).

What you want here is the drivers to register each side of the
connection. That could be modeled with something like the following
(pseudocode):

struct of_endpoint {
	struct list_head list;
	struct device_node *ep_node;
	void *context;
	void (*cb)(struct of_endpoint *ep, void *data);
}

int of_register_port(struct device *node, void (*cb)(struct of_endpoint *ep, void *data), void *data)
{
	struct of_endpoint *ep = kzalloc(sizeof(*ep), GFP_KERNEL);

	ep->ep_node = node;
	ep->data = data;
	ep->callback = cb;

	/* store the endpoint to a list */
	/* check if the endpoint has a remote-endpoint link */
		/* If so, then link the two together and call the
		 * callbacks */
}

That's neither expensive or complicated.

Originally I suggested walking the whole tree multiple times, but as
mentioned that doesn't scale, and as I thought about the above it isn't
even a valid thing to do. Everything has to be driven by drivers, so
even if the backlinks are there, nothing can be done with the link until
the other side goes through enumeration independently.
