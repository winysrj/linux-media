I'd much rather see a real cleanup.. eg. remove the need for sched.h to
include wait.h.

afaict its needed because struct signal_struct and struct sighand_struct
include a wait_queue_head_t. The inclusion seems to come through
completion.h, but afaict we don't actually need to include completion.h
because all we have is a pointer to a completion, which is perfectly
fine with an incomplete type.

This all would suggest we move the signal bits into their own header
(include/linux/signal.h already exists and seems inviting).

And then make sched.c include signal.h and completion.h.

But then, there might be a 'good' reason these signal bits live in
sched.h and not on their own, but I wouldn't know..
