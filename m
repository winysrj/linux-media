Circumstances change. We want to keep the stuff in user space as much and
as long as we can. However user space has limitations:

- it has by necessity a race between resumption and access by others
- it cannot resume anything we run a (rw) filesystem over.

Furthermore, today PM actions that lead to a loss of mode are initiated
by user space. If we ever want to oportunistically suspend a system
we also need to restore mode from inside the kernel.

We could avoid all that trouble, if we persuaded vendors to use plain
USB configurations for those purposes.
