i excuse you for the first sentence, but i still don't know what was
bad during my above paragraph, and i excuse you again. ( i thought
that the experienced programmer is a good adjective. )

i provided some of logs you told: the log of dmesg during inserting
the Pinnacle's DVB-Stick and output of "scan -v" and some others here:
http://daftar.minidns.net/pctv/some-log1.zip . This file has a file
named readme-first.txt containing description of its contents.

i will try to provide again the afatech-9015 based DVB-stick to find
the logs you want about it.
