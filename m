Ok, that makes sense. As long as we sufficiently taint the kernel and hide
the sw_sync framework we should be good. I was confused by the hw composer
interface spec which seemed to suggest that the fences for a screen update
completion should be attached before surfaceflinger commits the state. But
I never looked at an implemention so guess that impression is wrong.

I'm not against timestamps (we have them for drm vblank events too after
all), just would like for them to be optional. And we need to give
userspace very clear indication which hw clock the timestamp was based on
(or whether we're using the clock_monotonic system clock) to make sure
debug and profiling tools can properly align things. Because hw clocks
always get out of sync. Last time I've looked at the syncpt ioctls that
part was missing.

Yeah I know, and it double-frustrates me that I haven't yet managed to
drag our own team into the public. Except for a few bolt-on hacks to make
deadlines the android driver is the upstream one ...

Nah, definitely not asking for that. I'd just like to have a real
implemention in a real driver merged upstream and the userpsace/kernel ABI
reviewed a bit before I want to sign up for something we'll need to keep
working forever. E.g. I also think we should expose the actual waiting
through poll and friends for neater integration with the usual display
toolkit event loops. egl shys away from such platform specific stuff, but
we can do it.

Like I've said I want to have to deal with one fence primitive in the
lower levels of my driver for scheduling and synchronization and all that.
The fence proposal fits the bill from my pov since the implicit
synchronization with dma-bufs is optional. But the integration with
android syncpts seems to not yet be there really.
