Hello Matthias,

I'd like to ask you, or anyone else who is also familiar with the new 
TeVii's and their Linux support, about the new S464 tuner.

I have an excellent experience with old S460, it's the most stable 
DVB-S2 card I ever had. I want to build a 5 card sat. back-end (most PCI 
slots I found on any motherboard) and I'm looking for other cx88 
alternatives from TeVii.

V4L sources suggest the new S464 is basically the same HW, except for 
the new M88DS3000 demodulator. I think you're probably even better 
person to ask about their performance in Linux. Does S464 work without 
issues (voltage, 22kHz, DiSEqC, signal monitoring, S2)? Old S460 never 
froze on me, it's 100% stable, quick to lock, no reboots required and 
the sensitivity was OK - you see why I'm excited about the new S464.

Can you tell me what's new and better about S464? Is it ready for prime 
time in Linux?

BTW, I must comment on your company's attitude towards Linux - proper 
driver sources, official support, that's not what we're used to from 
other manufacturers. Well done!

Best wishes,
