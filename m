It shouldn't be hard to fix up the lirc_zilog.c use of adap->id but it
may require a change to the hdpvr driver as well.

As I was looking, I noticed this commit is incomplete:

http://git.linuxtv.org/media_tree.git?a=commitdiff;h=07cc65d4f4a21a104269ff7e4e7be42bd26d7acb

The "goto" was missed in the conditional compilation for the HD-PVR:

http://git.linuxtv.org/media_tree.git?a=blob;f=drivers/staging/lirc/lirc_zilog.c;h=f0076eb025f1a0e9d412080caab87f627dda4970#l844

You might want to revert the trivial commit that removed the "done:"
label.  When I clean up the dependence on adap->id, I may need the
"done:" label back again.

I'll modify lirc_i2c.c in three stages to do this:

1. get rid of adapter->id use
	- Trivial for I2C address 0x71 (the Zilog Z8F0811 chip's IR Rx)
	- Requires modifications to cx88 for the LeadTek PVR2000.
2. drop support for ir already handled by bridge drivers + ir-kbd-i2c
3. move support for remainders in lirc_i2c to ir-kbd-i2c and bridge
drivers

Andy
