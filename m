No it isn't. Cropping is cropping, regardless of how you look at it.

If your sensor has no scaler the output size is equal to the crop rectangle. 
There's no way around that, and there's no reason to have the driver behave 
otherwise.

Users who want to crop use S_CROP.

That's because they don't want to crop. mplayer expects the driver to perform 
scaling when it calls S_FMT, and users won't be happy if you crop instead.
