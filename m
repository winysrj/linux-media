OK, that makes sense. Are the RX and TX independent with regards to
band selection?

Make sure that when the band is changed the rangelow and rangehigh values
are also changed. If the current frequency is out of that range, then the
frequency should be clamped to the closest value frequency. Although an
alternative strategy might be to remember the last used frequency for each
band. That might make more sense in the case of switching between a normal
band and the weather band. We need to define and document which strategy
should be used here.

BTW, is the receiver for the weather band implemented as a separate receiver?
I read that some devices can listen to the normal band and interrupt that
when a weather report is broadcast on the weather band. That implies two
receivers and it would require a rethink.

Also, is this feature really implemented as separate frequency ranges in
hardware? Or is the receiver able to receive on the whole range of frequencies
from 65.8 (OIRT) to approx. 165 (weather band range)?

Is the datasheet of this device available somewhere?

Isn't this something that can be equally easily done in userspace?
