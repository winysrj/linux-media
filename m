There are several drivers depending on core modules like videobuf2. By making
random changes for something that _looks like_ a bug to you and not verifying
it by testing with at least one driver you are potentially causing trouble to
developers that are already busy fixing real bugs or working on new features.

I appreciate your help but I also don't want to see _any_ untested, not trivial
patches for core modules like videobuf2 being applied.
