Greetings,

I have been ill and trying to reach you,this is my seventh time of writing you
this email. My wife and I won a  Lottery of  $11.2 million in July and have
voluntarily decided to donate the sum of  $1,000,000.00 USD to you as part
of our own charity project to improve the lot of 5 lucky individuals  
all over the
world.

If you have received this email then you are one of the lucky recipients and
all you have to do is get back with us so that we can send your details to the
payout bank.

You can verify this by visiting the web pages below.
