It actually is a requirement: when a device node appears applications can
reasonably expect to have a fully functioning device. True for any device
node. You don't want to have to wait until some unspecified time before
the full functionality is there.

I try to pay attention to this when reviewing code, since not following this
rule basically introduces a race condition which is hard to test.

Right.

Adding support for cases where devices may not be present is very desirable,
but this should go through an RFC process first to hammer out all the details.

Today we do not support this and we have to review code with that in mind.

So the first async subnotifiers implementation should NOT support this (although
it can of course be designed with this in mind). Once it is in we can start
on an RFC on how to support partial pipelines. I have a lot of questions about
that that need to be answered first.

One thing at a time. Trying to do everything at once never works.
