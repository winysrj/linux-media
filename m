This is a HUGE patch set. You'd need to have a good reason for such a
big and intrusive change, yet I see no such reason explained. I
understand that we _can_ abstract system information interfaces, but
just because we can doesn't mean we have to. I would at least wait for
a second DMI-like interface to be widely implemented and support before
any attempt to abstract, otherwise your design is bound to be missing
the target. And even then, you'd still need to convince me that there
is a need for a unified interface to access both backends at once. I
would guess that you know what backend is present on a system when you
try to identify it.

At this point, I see the work needed to review your patches, the risk
of regressions due to the large size of the patch set, but I don't see
any immediate benefit. Thus I am not going to look into it at all,
sorry.
