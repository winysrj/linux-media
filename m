Per-component vs. global controls.

Few devices support both; AFAIR on SMIA the user can choose which one to
use, but the driver implements neither currently.

Do you think it'd require a new control type? There might be many; some
devices use funny fixed point values, such as u8.u5. I guess you could use
step for those, sure.

For instance, some sensors natively use lines to tell the exposure value
(and in low level sensors control the granularity really matters, so lines
it should be) whereas some SoC ones could use µs instead.

This is about units and prefixes IMO. Fixed point is just a prefix, such as
milli or micro, but instead of being a power of ten it's a power of two.

This would also allow telling the user about a gain control that e.g. the
value 0x100 means "no gain".

I think someone should write an RFC about this. :-)
