Hello all,

I'm attempting to find a supported DVB-S PCI card with an on-card CI 
(ie: not a seperate daughter board) to contain all in one slot.

Based on the wiki and mailing list archives I seem to come up with the 
Twinhan AD-SP300(1034): http://www.twinhan.com/product_satellite_1034.asp

But the wiki entries seem to refer to a 1030A version:
http://www.linuxtv.org/wiki/index.php/Twinhan_VP-1030A

Are these the same boards and/or different revisions? Are they supported 
by the Mantis driver including the CI? This part I wasn't able to 
confirm from my search.

Are there other suggestions for such cards that are 100% supported?

Thanks,
Thomas
