I agree. Some of these such as the timeout are not hardware related
problems at all, but others may be. I'd keep the same semantics as V4L2
already does.

I'd guess a single application accesses either of the interfaces. From that
point of view it doesn't matter what are the bit definitions in V4L2.

The behaviour on sysfs could also be different, e.g. writing the attribute
would clear the faults. This would need more functionality from drivers.
The V4L2 behaviour mirrors the typical behaviour of flash controllers ---
the chips mostly do not operate until the faults have been read, and the
interface as well as the interface take no stance to that. So when the user
reads the fault control value, the fault register on the chip is cleared as
well.
