Thanks a lot for considering similar issues in uprobes, Oleg: I merely
checked that its uses of get_user_pages() would not be problematic,
and didn't look around to rediscover the worrying mm business that
goes on down there in kernel/events.

Good question. I simply didn't consider that - and (as you have realized)
didn't need to consider it, because I was just stopping the problematic
behaviour in gup(), and didn't need to consider whether other behaviour
prohibited by gup() was actually unproblematic.

I don't think there is a "strong" reason to forbid it.

The strongest reason is simply that it's much safer if uprobes follows
the same conventions as mm, and get_user_pages() happens to have
forbidden that all along.

The philosophical reason to forbid it is that the user mmapped with
MAP_SHARED, and it's merely a kernel-internal detail that we flip off
VM_SHARED and treat these read-only shared mappings very much like
private mappings.  The user asked for MAP_SHARED, and we prefer to
respect that by not letting private COWs creep in.

We could treat those mappings even more like private mappings, and
allow the COWs; but better to be strict about it, so long as doing
so doesn't give you regressions.

I think a one-line patch changing VM_SHARED to VM_MAYSHARE would do it,
wouldn't it?  And save you from having to export is_cow_mapping()
from mm/memory.c.  (I used is_cow_mapping() because I had to make the
test more complex anyway, just to exclude the case which had been
oddly handled before.)
