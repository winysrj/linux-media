We BUG_ON() in bootmem.  Basically if we try to allocate an early-boot
structure and fail, we're screwed.  We can't keep running without an
inode hash, or a mem_map[].

This looks like it's going to at least get partially used in drivers, at
least from the examples.  Are these kinds of things that, if the driver
fails to load, that the system is useless and hosed?  Or, is it
something where we might limp along to figure out what went wrong before
we reboot?
