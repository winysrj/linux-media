I don't think so. device->dma_mem can be accessed only via the
DMA-API. I think that the DMA-API says that
dma_declare_coherent_memory declares coherent memory that can be
access exclusively by a certain device. It's not for reserving
coherent memory that can be used for any device for a device.

Anway, you don't need coherent memory. So using the API for coherent
memory isn't a good idea.

I don't think that's a good idea. Adding temporary workaround to the
generic API and removing it soon after that doesn't sound a good
developing maner.
