Andy,

just to clarify things a bit I'll give a short statement now.

The role of jusst technologies in the whole multiproto story is as 
following:
The time when DVB-S2 came up this was of course of major interest for 
jusst technologies, so we searched for people working on drivers. At 
that not many people did seem to care about this stuff - but Manu did. 
So we got in contact and tried to help him as much as we can, which 
included making up connections to KNC1 for technical questions and 
datasheets, provide a KNC1 testing board and later then give free 
web/codespace to Manu.
Furthermore we of course did lots of testing of multiproto. But never we 
did pay Manu for any of this work.
Reading that you should recognize that there can't be much financial 
interests for Manu.

Seeing that you impute hyprocrisy to Manu due to "facts" you don't have 
proven in any way makes me a bit contemplative. I don't like being 
political when talking about technical terms (which linuxtv in first 
place should be about imho) - anyway this one time I will give a 
somewhat political statement, too.
All you guys who are blaming Manu to do some wrong or bad stuff, what is 
your point? - I see you searching quote where Manu did talk in a 
somewhat unpolite manner just to blame him of being the wrong person 
introducing a new API? - I have no interest in doing the same quoting 
with your postings or the so called competitors postings, but I'd bed I 
could quote almost any of you in a not less distracting manner than you 
like to do with Manu.

Using "taking too long" as an argument against an API proposal is really 
interesting. What did you expect? - A quick shot which is not well 
thought about wouldn't have be a good thing for anyone.
I'm absolutely fine if anyone would came up with real technical 
arguments, but reading many postings so far I couldn't find much of such 
statements.

To be political again: Thank you for blaming jusst being not interested 
in proper technical solutions. What makes you thinking of this? - Just 
the fact that you recognize jusst as a commercial company? Very interesting.

I really have a feeling that many people here are mostly interested in 
making politics instead of thinking about technical solutions which 
makes all this a horrible topic for all that people who are interested 
in a working solution (which Manu has proven to deliver) - mainly the users.

So far this is my statement (in representation for jusst technologies) 
for the moment.

Best regards,
Julian
