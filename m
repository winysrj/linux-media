The CX23888 and CX23102 can do it.  Basically any IR pulse pattern your
heart desires; within reason.  And any carrier freq you want too; within
reason.

But let's be real, the cx23885, cx231xx, and cx25840 modules are nowhere
near properly supporing suspend/resume for their main video and DMA
functions, AFAIK.
