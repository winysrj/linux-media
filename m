Okay, if that's still a global in this day and age,
then I suppose I'll just have to special-case it here in my copy.

The hardware itself is capable of much faster repeat rates,
and prior to 2.6.36 I used to patch it for intelligent ramp-up
on repeats inside ir-kbd-i2c.

As of 2.6.36 that stopped working, and is now limited somewhere
to no more than one repeat every 210msecs.

Cheers
