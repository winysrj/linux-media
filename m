On all V4L/DVB drivers I'm ware of, firmwares are loaded via request_firmware, when
userspace tries to use the device, or when the driver is loaded (eventually, it might
have some v4l/dvb legacy drivers with some weird implementation, but this is a bad
practice).

There's currently no V4L/DVB load firmware daemon or V4L/DVB udev rules for loading
firmware that I'm ware of, and I don't like the idea of adding an extra complexity
for userspace to use this device.

So, I'll be adding this driver as proposed. Yet, as some points are risen, I'll
be moving those drivers to staging for 2.6.38. This will give you some time for
propose patches and to better discuss this question.
