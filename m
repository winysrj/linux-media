I think we still have the same problem if we allow multiple drivers
to access a noncoherent buffer using map/unmap:

	driver A				driver B

1.	read/write				
2.						read/write
3.	map()					
4.						read/write
5.	dma
6.						map()
7.	dma
8.						dma
9.	unmap()
10.						dma
11.	read/write
12.						unmap()						


In step 4, the buffer is owned by device A, but accessed by driver B, which
is a bug. In step 11, the buffer is owned by device B but accessed by driver
A, which is the same bug on the other side. In steps 7 and 8, the buffer
is owned by both device A and B, which is currently undefined but would
be ok if both devices are on the same coherency domain. Whether that point
is meaningful depends on what the devices actually do. It would be ok
if both are only reading, but not if they write into the same location
concurrently.

As I mentioned originally, the problem could be completely avoided if
we only allow consistent (e.g. uncached) mappings or buffers that
are not mapped into the kernel virtual address space at all.

Alternatively, a clearer model would be to require each access to
nonconsistent buffers to be exclusive: a map() operation would have
to block until the current mapper (if any) has done an unmap(), and
any access from the CPU would also have to call a dma_buf_ops pointer
to serialize the CPU accesses with any device accesses. User
mappings of the buffer can be easily blocked during a DMA access
by unmapping the buffer from user space at map() time and blocking the
vm_ops->fault() operation until the unmap().

Right, at last for the start, let's mandate just map/unmap and not provide
sync. I do wonder however whether we should implement consistent (possibly
uncached) or streaming (cacheable, but always owned by either the device
or the CPU, not both) buffers, or who gets to make the decision which
one is used if both are implemented.

It's currently implemented in the ARM/PowerPC-specific dma_mmap_coherent
function and documented (hardly) in arch/arm/include/asm/dma-mapping.h.

We should make clear in that this is actually an extension of the
regular dma mapping api that first needs to be made generic.

AFAICT, the only reason for providing an mmap operation in the dma_buf
file descriptor is "because we can". It may in fact be better to leave
that part out and have the discussion whether this is actually a good
thing to do after the dma_buf core code has been merged upstream.

As I mentioned, the kernel can easily block out the user map by
transparently unmapping the buffer. I've done that in spufs for
context-switching an SPU: during the save and restore phase of the
SPU local memory to system memory, the page tables entries for
all user mappings are removed and then faulted back in after the
context switch. We can do the same during a DMA on a noncoherent
buffer.

Yes, good point.
