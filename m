Honza,

I, for one, would love to see your virtual DVB device driver hosted in
a repository for the purposes of experimentation and additional
development.  I can think of many, many good uses for such a virtual
device driver.  Unfortunately, however, all the device vendors also
have uses for it.  It a guarunteed fact that if a driver like that got
merged into the kernel, any software company that previously sponsored
open-source kernel development would opt instead for closed source
userspace drivers that depend on a virtual DVB device.

Please don't let that discourage you -- I think you should continue
your work on this virtual DVB device driver, and I'd love to play with
it myself, and possibly even contribute to it.  ...but I will never
support the merging of this into the kernel.

I do not nack the existence of the driver -- I love the idea, and I
encourage more development.  I only nack it's merging into any
open-source linux kernel.

Please accept my answer with the greatest intentions for furthering
the development of the open-source community.  My opinion is only for
the best intentions of continued contributions from companies such as
Hauppauge and any others that have contributed thus far to v4l/dvb.

Please, keep up the work.  I repeat -- I would love to play with your work.

Best regards,

Mike Krufky
