I have no objection to this.  As for the firmware path, maybe we should
change that to be modified by userspace (much like /sbin/hotplug was) in
a proc file so that distros can override the location if they need to.
But for now, that's probably overkill.  This solves the problem that
Mauro and others have reported and can be easily backported by any
affected distros if needed.
