perhaps yes.  But the device is associated w/ the iommu it is attached
to, so this shouldn't be a problem

it is exposed for drm plane's.  What is missing is to expose the
primary-plane associated with the crtc.

Right, the gem object has no inherent format, it is just some bytes.
The format/width/height/pitch are all attributes of the fb.

well, you really shouldn't be using create_dumb..  you should have a
userspace piece that is specific to the drm driver, and knows how to
use that driver's gem allocate ioctl.

maybe not.. but (a) you don't necessarily know at creation time if it
is going to be exported (maybe you know if it is definitely not going
to be exported, but the converse is not true), and (b) there isn't
really any reason to special case the allocation in the driver because
it is going to be exported.

helpers that can be used by simple drivers, yes.  Forcing the way the
buffer is allocated, for sure not.  Currently, for example, there is
no issue to export a buffer allocated from stolen-mem.  If we put the
page allocation in dma-buf, this would not be possible.  That is just
one quick example off the top of my head, I'm sure there are plenty
more.  But we definitely do not want the allocate in dma_buf itself.

if, what it has to configure actually manages to fit in the
dma-mapping framework

anyways, where the pages come from has nothing to do with whether a
buffer can be shared or not

afaiu it can be a, b, or c (ie. either gpu can have the display or
there can be a mux)..

well, for example, if there was actually some hw w/ omap's dss + mali,
you could actually have mali render transparently to tiled buffers
which could be scanned out rotated.  Which would not be possible w/
dumb buffers.

In a way the display driver is a per-SoC allocator.  But not
necessarily the *central* allocator for everything.  Ie. no need for
display driver to allocate vertex buffers for a separate gpu driver,
and that sort of thing.
