This is probably the problems i have seen.
my usb based card also have a si2168.

since i don't have any good physical machine i used a vm (kvm) and 
attached the usb device there.
this works best if the device is in cold state, if driver finds it in 
warm state things dont work very well.

but at the moment i also got another issue with the last round of 
updates to media_build.
a few weeks ago modueles was loading properly and earlier in the week 
when i tested the modules dont load at all and errors during loading.
can test again and post output of dmesg
this is a new issue.

kernel modules from a few weeks ago loads but tuning only works once 
after module load.
then there is no signal at all and it doesnt lock on to the signa.
