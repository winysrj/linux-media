LOL -- that's hilarious; I had checked both
http://www.mail-archive.com/linux-media@vger.kernel.org/thrd5.html#01125
and
http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.linux.drivers.video-input-infrastructure/203/focus=42489
and couldn't find it, so I didn't bother looking for it on spinics.
(Personally, I prefer neither of the 3 above archives, rather, I like
Marc, which I don't believe we've contacted yet ... I will bug Mauro
about this in a minute). I had figured that it might have been a
limitation with the message size. Anyway, good to know that the Jan 25th
message made its way to at least one archive.
