We had a similar problem in the past and we ended up having the boot loader
setting up the parent clock for the device clock. The driver only controls clock
gating and sets its clock frequency based on an internal IP version information,
derived from the SoC revision.

AFAIK there is also a generic API at the runtime PM core so the driver can
register the clock(s) with it and only use pm_runtime_clk_* calls afterwards.
