Subject: [RFC PATCH 0/2] managed token devres interfaces 
Date: Wed,  9 Apr 2014 09:21:06 -0600

Media devices often have hardware resources that are shared
across several functions. For instance, TV tuner cards often
have MUXes, converters, radios, tuners, etc. that are shared
across various functions. However, v4l2, alsa, DVB, usbfs, and
all other drivers have no knowledge of what resources are
shared. For example, users can't access DVB and alsa at the same
time, or the DVB and V4L analog API at the same time, since many
only have one converter that can be in either analog or digital
mode. Accessing and/or changing mode of a converter while it is
in use by another function results in video stream error.

A shared devres that can be locked and unlocked by various drivers
that control media functions on a single media device is needed to
address the above problems.

A token devres that can be looked up by a token for locking, try
locking, unlocking will help avoid adding data structure
dependencies between various media drivers. This token is a unique
string that can be constructed from a common data structure such as
struct device, bus_name, and hardware address.

The devm_token_* interfaces manage access to token resource.

Interfaces:
    devm_token_create()
    devm_token_destroy()
    devm_token_lock()
    devm_token_unlock()
Usage:
    Create token:
        Call devm_token_create() with a token id which is a unique
        string.
    Lock token: Call devm_token_lock() to lock or try lock a token.
    Unlock token: Call devm_token_unlock().
    Destroy token: Call devm_token_destroy() to delete the token.

A new devres_* interface to update the status of this token resource
to busy when locked and free when unlocked is necessary to implement
this new managed resource.

devres_update() searches for the resource that matches supplied match
criteria similar to devres_find(). When a match is found, it calls
the update function caller passed in.

This patch set adds a new devres_update) interface and token devres
interfaces.

Test Cases for token devres interfaces: (passed)
 - Create, lock, unlock, and destroy sequence.
 - Try lock while it is locked. Returns -EBUSY as expected.
 - Try lock after destroy. Returns -ENODEV as expected.
 - Unlock while it is unlocked. Returns 0 as expected. This is a no-op. 
 - Try unlock after destroy. Returns -ENODEV as expected.

Special notes for Mauro Chehab:
 - Please evaluate if these token devres interfaces cover all media driver
   use-cases. If not what is needed to cover them.
 - For use-case testing, I generated a string from em28xx device, as this
   is common for all em28xx extensions: (hope this holds true when em28xx
   uses snd-usb-audio
 - Construct string with (dev is struct em28xx *dev)
		format: "tuner:%s-%s-%d"
		with the following:
   		dev_name(&dev->udev->dev)
                dev->udev->bus->bus_name
                dev->tuner_addr
 - I added test code to em28xx_card_setup() to test the interfaces:
   example token from this test code generated with the format above:

usb 8-1: devm_token_create(): created token: tuner:8-1-0000:00:10.1-0
