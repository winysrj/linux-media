Well, it depends on what you name "device" ;) If you call it the Linux device that
will handle the Remote Controller, then, the keymap is not driver-specific data. 

They will follow one of the protocol standards, like RC-5 (14 bits), NEC (16 bits), 
NEC EXTENDED (24 bits), some NEC variants with 32 bits, RC6 (there are several modes,
and the key length depends on what mode is used, ranging from 16 to 64 bits).

The problem is that some drivers support the NEC protocol, with 16 bits, plus 16
bits of checksum, but doesn't support the variants that (ab)use the checksum bits
to extend it to 24 or 32 bits. So, if we do (4), the userspace program will clean
the keytable but will fail on the new keytable programming.

Currently, the driver exports the supported protocols, but it doesn't export the
protocol variants. Maybe the better would be to also export the supported protocol
variants via sysfs.

Cheers,
Mauro
