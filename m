msm is also interested in a drm/v4l bridge on the capture/writeback side.
Although I haven't convinced them yet that rolling their own isn't
awesome.

Yeah, this looks rather nice&tidy. A few questions/ideas:
- Should we also go right ahead and add live sinks here with this and
  enumerate both live sinks and sources as live resources or something
  similar? The only big difference I see is that sinks will have different
  attachment points than sources.

- Not fully sure about possible_planes. I guess if the justification is
  that the drm core can take care of some input validation for drivers
  then it's useful. But if the idea is that userspace can use this to
  figure out the routing then I think this won't work.

- Do we need other basic checks like max/min width/height? Same concern as
  above.

- I think a live_resource_create callback would be useful so that the
  driver can check additional constraints (maybe just some size will work
  if e.g. it feeds directly into an mpeg encoder). Also I think we should
  figure out whether the addfb2 call or only attaching the live
  source/sink locks down the configuration on the v4l side of things.
  Imo locking down the settings has the advantage that you can do that all
  upfront on both v4l and drm side, and then immediately start the
  pipeline with just connecting it.

- Some helper to connect the drm and v4l side of things might be useful,
  especially to make sure you don't end up with incompatible settings on
  either end. Ties in with the above question of where we want to lock
  down the settings.

- Do we need some additional properties on live sources/sinks to at least
  make the connection with v4l? Or is the idea that we'll do this with the
  media link framework (in which case another part of some helper)?

Ok that's it for first thoughts from me.
