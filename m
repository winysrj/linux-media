[Hiremath, Vaibhav] Laurent,

I completely agree with your point that, existing application will not work without setting links properly. But I believe the assumption here is, media-controller should set the links (along with pad formants) and all existing application should work as is. Isn't it?

The way it is being done currently is, set the format at the pad level which is same as analog standard resolution and use existing application for streaming...

I am ok, if we add s/g/enum_std api support at sub-dev level but this should also be supported on streaming device node.

Thanks,
Vaibhav
