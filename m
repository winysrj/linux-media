Sigh again

Did a module only build for the i2c-mux and got it into the currently 
running kernel with a force to bypass the no symbol version for 
module_layout error.. figured it was safe enough given it was the 
identical kernel config etc from the centos vault...

Anyway still failed.. though the module seemed to install and is showing 
with lsmod no dmesg barfs..
I'll try a full kernel build tomorrow..

Regards
