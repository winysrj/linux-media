usb_make_path returns -1 if sizeof buffer is smaler than path (no device
or hardware troubles). Bus_info is 32 byte and usb path looks like:
"usb-%s-%s", dev->bus->bus_name, dev->devpath (from usb.h). I failed
trying to find size of bus_name, but maximum size of dev->devpath is 16
chars.

So, i'm confused about two things:
- as this information goes to userspace, will userpace feel bad that
trucated string will be delivered? And do v4l-subsystem care enough to
provide complete usb-path?
- will it happened one day that usb_make_path returns -1 and we care?

I don't have ideas about first thing.
In case we care to provide full usb-path - may be check for returned
value should be placed, print message and ask user, for example:
"usb_make_path error! Please send message to linux-media maillist".
In case of many reports size of bus_info[32] can be increased.

By other side, if this all is really important? It's right that ignoring
returned value is safe.
