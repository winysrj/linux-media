Hi,

These first patch fix a issue which was discussed back in 2016 that the 
field format of the adv7180 should be V4L2_FIELD_ALTERNATE. While the 
second patch adds support for the g_frame_interval video op.

Work is loosely based on work by Steve Longerbeam posted in 2016. I have 
talked to Steven and he have agreed to me taking over the patches as he 
did not intend to continue his work on the original series.

The series is based on the latest media-tree and tested on Renesas 
Koelsch board.

Niklas SÃ¶derlund (2):
  adv7180: fix field type to V4L2_FIELD_ALTERNATE
  adv7180: add g_frame_interval support
