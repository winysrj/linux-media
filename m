This commits adds vcm_ref_reserve() and refcnt member into vcm_res
structure. This feature is enabled by turnning on
CONFIG_VCM_RES_REFCNT. This enables the users of the vcm framework
not to care about the sequence of reserving and unreserving
in complex scenarios.

+** Aquiring and releasing ownership of a reservation
+
+Once a device driver reserve a reservation, it may want to pass other device
+drivers or attach the reservation in a data structre. Since the reservation
+may be shared among many device drivers, the VCM context is needed to provide
+a simple way to unreserve a reservation.

+	struct vcm_res *__must_check
+	vcm_reserve(struct vcm *vcm, resource_size_t size, unsigned flags);
+
+	int __must_check vcm_ref_reserve(struct vcm_res *res);
+
+vcm_reserve() creates a new reservation, thus the first owner of the
+reservation is set to the caller of vcm_reservation(). It then passes to a
+function the reservation. The function that received the reservation calls
+vcm_ref_reserve() to acquire the ownership of the given reservation. If the
+function decides that it does not need the reservation any more, it calls
+vcm_release() to release the ownership of the reservation.
+
+	void vcm_unreserve(struct vcm_res *res);
+
+It is not required to determine if other functions and drivers still need to
+access the reservation because this function just release the ownership of the
+reservation. If vcm_unreserve() finds no one has the ownership of the given
+reservation, only then does it unreserve (remove) the given reservation.
