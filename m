The previous generation of the tool:

... an easycap DC60+ clone. Doubly hating it since I bought is sure that
it would have been supported!

I presume that with decoder you mean the composite to YUV translator... With the datasheet is too easy :D strange thing is eMPIA says that linux
is supported for some of their chip. But of course the 2980 isn't even
advertised and probably they only give you docs if you buy 100K pieces:(

Please tell if there are other tests or captures you need. By the way,
even on Windows, transfer seems flaky. If the bus is not perfectly
idle or there is some nontrivial CPU load often it loses transfer sync
and the image get "split" (probably an isoc transfer get lost and it
doesn't number the packets or something). Had the same problem with the
other chinese camera I used (USB suckitude knows no limits:P)
