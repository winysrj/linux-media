This isn't stupid. I had the same though after replying you.
Intuitively, I would think that monotonic clock is a better choice for
multimedia. I am just speculating but I would say that ffmpeg decided to
use realtime clock as the standard clock throughout the project for
portability purposes since it is a cross-platform project.

Now you know how I ended up trying the clock=realtime option.
IMHO, if the option is there, it should be working but just removing it
could also be a valid option.

I feel that this could bring some new problems if it stays there
because, I'll be honest and say that I didn't test the driver behavior
when the time goes backward....
