Adding pad index to new API is trivial, as your RFC patch pointed.

Changing media-ctl to fully use the new ioctl is not trivial, as it
was written on a non-portable way, very dependent on the kernel API
specifics[1]. I suspect that it is a lot more easier to add support
for MEDIA_IOC_SETUP_LINK to mc_nextgen_test and rename it to
media-ctl[2].

[1] I tried it before working at contrib/test/mc_nextgen_test.c. The
internal data model used by media-ctl library was just a clone of the
model returned by the ioctls. Even a minimal change on the way ioctls 
return things (even adding new entity types) is enough to break it.

[2] It would be possible, however, to make media-ctl to use 
G_TOPOLOGY, ignoring new features that can't be represented using
the old ioctls and providing fallback to entity functions in order
to represent media types. It won't be too much elegant though.

Nah, Let's not touch the old ioctls. Instead, we should stick
with the new API and convert (or replace) existing applications to
use it, as the old ioctl set can't even represent the interfaces.
