Some research showed that Intel never support i810/i815 SMP setups,
but there was indeed one company (http://www.acorpusa.com at the time,
now owned by a domain squatter) that made i815E based dual Pentium-III
boards like this one: http://cgi.ebay.com/280319795096

The first person that can send me an authentic log file showing the
use of X.org with DRM on a 2.6.35 kernel with two processors on that
mainboard dated today or earlier gets a free upgrade to an AGP graphics
card of comparable or better 3D performance from me. Please include
the story how why you are running this machine with a new kernel.

i830 is harder, apparently some i865G boards support Pentium 4 with HT
and even later dual-core processors.
