It shouldn't, as ivtv driver version is lower than 3.0.0. All the old bug fixes
aren't needed if version is >= 3.0.0.

Besides that, trusting on a driver revision number to detect that a bug is
there is not the right thing to do, as version numbers are never increased at
the stable kernels (nor distro modified kernels take care of increasing revision
number as patches are backported there).

In other words, relying on it doesn't work fine.

Why? Developers don't increase version numbers on every applied patch
(with is great, as it avoids merge conflicts).
