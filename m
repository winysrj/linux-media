dev->dma_params (struct device_dma_parameters).. for example

it would need to be expanded a bit to have a way to say "it needs to
be physically contiguous"..

But this problem really only applies if v4l is your buffer allocator.
I don't think a v4l limitation is a valid argument to remove the
attachment stuff.

I think it would be sufficient if buffer creators that cannot defer
the allocation just take a worst-case approach and allocate physically
contiguous buffers.  No need to penalize other potential buffer
allocators.  This allows buffer creators with more flexibility the
option for deferring the allocation until it knows whether the buffer
really needs to be contiguous.

fwiw, this wasn't intended for allowing the client to create the
mapping.. the intention was that the buffer creator always be the one
that implements the mmap'ing.  This was just to implement fops->mmap()
for the dmabuf handle, ie. so userspace could mmap the buffer without
having to know *who* allocated it.  Otherwise you have to also pass
around the fd of the allocator and an offset.
