This patch doesn't apply anymore on my tree.

It probably conflicted with this one:

commit 2b12a23223d05a1192e1e55775b79d6caa52b066
Author: David HÃ¤rdeman <david@hardeman.nu>

    V4L/DVB: drivers/media/IR - improve keytable code

    The attached patch rewrites much of the keytable code in
    drivers/media/IR/ir-keytable.c.


Cheers,
Mauro
