Hi,

I've bought a 

	TerraTec Cinergy T PCIe dual

On linuxtv.org it says it is supported (although unconfirmed) in 3.3.
I'm now running this kernel, but no luck. To be fair I do not know for
sure if it is the driver or the hardware. I do not have an easy way to
try it with another OS... 

Also it doesn't even show in lspci. What does that mean, is that normal
for a card that is not supported yet?

grts Tim
