I spoke too soon... removing the index causes a problem at the read ioctl: there's no way
to retrieve just the non-sparsed values.

There's one solution that would allow both read/write and compat to work nicely,
but the API would become somewhat asymmetrical:

At get (EVIOCGKEYCODEBIG):
	use index/len as input and keycode/scancode as output;

At set (EVIOCSKEYCODEBIG):
	use scancode/keycode/len as input (and, optionally, index as output).

Having it asymmetrical doesn't sound good, but, on the other hand, using index for
the set function also doesn't seem good, as the driver may reorder the entries after
setting, for example to work with a binary tree or with hashes.

I'll think a little more about it and do some experiments.

Cheers,
Mauro
