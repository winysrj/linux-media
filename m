During the development of this code, we also looked at shared TLB entries, but
the other way around. We wanted to use them to prevent flushing of TLB entries of
shared memory regions when switching between multiple ASes. Unfortunately, we never
finished this part of the code.

However, we also investigated into a different use-case for first class virtual
address spaces that is related to what you propose if I didn't understand something
wrong. The idea is to move shared libraries into their own first class virtual
address space and only load some small trampoline code in the application AS. This
trampoline code performs the VAS switch in the libraries AS and execute the requested
function there. If we combine this architecture with tagged TLB entries to prevent
TLB flushes during the switch operation, it can also reach an acceptable performance.
A side effect of moving the shared library into its own AS is that it can not be used
by ROP-attacks because it is not accessible in the application's AS.
