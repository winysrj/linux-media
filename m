Subject: HD-PVR fails consistently on Linux, works on Windows

I recently purchased a Hauppauge HD-PVR (the 1212 version, label on 
bottom 49001LF, Rev F2).  I have consistent capture failures on Linux 
where data from the device simply stops, generally within a few minutes 
of starting a capture.  Yet, the device works flawlessly on Windows with 
the same USB and component cables, same power supply, and same physical 
position.  This suggests that the device itself has acceptable power, is 
not overheating, etc.  I'll detail below the testing I've done thus far 
and would appreciate any suggestions on how to further test or address 
the problem.

The good news is that I have a highly reproducible failure on Linux, but 
then that's the bad news too.

Thanks.

Keith

-- Linux tests --
I started trying to use the HD-PVR directly with my MythTV backend. I 
have subsequently switched all of my testing to simple direct captures 
from the /dev/video? device using /bin/cat to eliminate as many 
variables as possible.

I've done a large number of tests with combinations of the following:

OS: gentoo 3.4.7, gentoo 3.5.4
HD-PVR firmware: 1.5.7.0 (0x15), 1.7.1.30059 (0x1e)
Input resolution: fixed to 720p, fixed to 1080i, floating based on input
USB ports: motherboard ports on Intel DP45SG, motherboard ports on MSI 
X58 Pro-E, ports on SIIG USB PCIe card

Captures fail consistently.

I've verified that the HD-PVR is the only device on the USB bus and that 
the bus shows as "Linux Foundation 2.0 root hub" in all tests. I've 
increased the debug output level for the hdpvr driver to 6 
(/sys/module/hdpvr/parameters/hdpvr_debug) and collected the following:

If I understand correctly, this is showing a ETIMEDOUT error.  When I've 
looked at the cat with strace, it is always blocked on a read. So, it 
seems like the HD-PVR just stops sending.

I also ran a USB capture with wireshark and see much the same thing.  
While I haven't tried to decode the USB packets, the pattern is that the 
HD-PVR sends, the host sends a message/ack, this pattern repeats, and 
then nothing.  The majority of the failures occur in less than 15 minutes.

-- Windows tests --

I installed the Hauppauge software on a Windows 7 system and moved the 
USB cable to the Windows system.  Nothing else was changed. I've run 
many hours of successful captures.  I've checked each recording with 
ffprobe and verified that each is the expected length (i.e., no data 
drops at all).  The recordings are of good quality. This shows that the 
HD-PVR is capable of working as expected and quite reliably.
