I took a look at those but in doing so I've (re)discovered the automatic rss
feed that each page generates. Those rss feeds can be polled by services
like feedmyinbox.com to generate a daily report.

Our Mediawiki version does not yet have the ability to generate RSS feeds 
for users' watchlists without them being logged in (I've seen that feature 
on MW 1.16beta on the iPodlinux.org wiki though), but I am happy enough 
with the general "Recent changes" and the individual pages' feeds.

Thank you very much for pointing me in the right direction

cheers
