I made this a separate module because there is one version of this
device that doesn't need any firmware.
But I think it would be better to include the bootloader in the real driver
for simplicity.

The problem with this device is that there is no way for the user to
know what version of the device he's got before the firmware is uploaded
to the device.

Any device will accept any firmware, but it will not function without
the correct firmware.

The only way to see what version of the firmware you will need is to
test the driver on a Windows machine with the driver that came with the
device. I have no idea about what the windows driver will do if you have
more than one version of this device.

Probably not, I'll remove this check :)

Yes, that is true.
I will fix,
