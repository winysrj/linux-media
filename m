That's pretty usual way, likely most common, having separate GPIO 
configuration and GPIO value registers. If you has a port of GPIO values 
in one register, and you has configured those as 0-3 INPUT and 4-7 
OUTPUT, then writing to that register does not make any changes to bits 
that are mapped as IN (are just discarded as don't care).

In case a bit I/O (which is not not supported by Kernel) writing to 
input register could enable internal pull-up or pull-down resistor :) 
IIRC Atmel micro-controllers has such option.
