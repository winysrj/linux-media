ok. I'll have to look into it, and just in case you see a problem on 
first sight:
this is what coda says with debug level 1, when doing

gst-launch-1.0 playbin uri=file:///data/test2_hd480.h264 
video-sink=fbdevsink

with the video file being (ffprobe)

Input #0, h264, from 'test2_hd480.h264':
   Duration: N/A, bitrate: N/A
     Stream #0:0: Video: h264 (High), yuv420p(progressive), 852x480, 24 
fps, 24 tbr, 1200k tbn, 48 tbc


after some s_ctrl: id/val printings:

so while the video is shown, the VDOA is "disabled".

                           thanks a lot for your help


(it's shown far from fluent yet, almost frame by frame, but that's ok 
for now... I'll still need to
took into the v4l2 interface for the imx6 IPU)

My cma buffer size was indeed just too small.
