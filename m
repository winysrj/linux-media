I'll grab the patch to get it a bit of testing while Al cogitates.

It would be nice to find some suitable place in the code where we can
explain all this to other potential users of the capability.  Perhaps
the implementation site for the currently undocumented
poll_requested_events() would be a suitable place.

coding style nit: we generally try to avoid multiple assignemnts like this.
