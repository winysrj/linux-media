I think it's a lame idea to clump all media related stuff into one
mailing list from separate ml's because 1) it's too general of a topic
and 2) those ml's already had a lot of activity on their own.  The
idea of sifting through tons of posts of no interest is quite a hassle
to say the least.  This "solution" just doesn't seem very well thought
out imo but it is what it is I guess.
