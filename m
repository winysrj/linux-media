My initial thought is for dma-buf to not try to prevent something than
an exporter can actually do.. I think the scenario you describe could
be handled by two sg-lists, if the exporter was clever enough.

That all said, I think probably all the existing exporters cache the
sg-list.  And I can't think of any actual hw which would hit this
problem that can be solved by multiple sg-lists for the same physical
memory.  (And the constraint calculation kind of assumes the end
result will be a single sg-list.)  So it seems reasonable to me to
check that max_segment_count * max_segment_size is not smaller than
the buffer.

If it was a less theoretical problem, I think I'd more inclined for a
way that the exporter could override the checks, or something along
those lines.

otoh, if the attachment is just not possible because the buffer has
been already allocated and mapped by someone with more relaxed
constraints.. then I think the driver should be the one returning the
error since dma-buf doesn't know this.

Ideally at some point, dma-mapping or some helpers would support
allocations matching constraints..  I think only actual gpu drivers
want to do crazy enough things that they'd want to bypass dma-mapping.
If everyone else can use dma-mapping and/or helpers then we make it
harder for drivers to do the wrong thing than to do the right thing.

It doesn't really negate.. a different sg list representing the same
physical memory cannot suddenly make the buffer physically contiguous
(from the perspective of memory)..

(unless we are not on the same page here, so to speak)
