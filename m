Hi Chris,
   Sorry for the delay reply. It seems like my reply last night was missed.

>From the sysinfo you provide, there are no pcie port devices under /sys/bus/pci_express/devices.
Maybe because there are some problems with _OSC in your laptop, so pcie port driver won't create pcie port device
for hotplug, aer and so on.

Maybe you can add boot parameter "pcie_ports=native" and reboot your laptop.
Then use #modprobe pciehp pciehp_force=1 pciehp_debug=1 to load pciehp modules.
After above actions, enter /sys/bus/pci_express/devices/ directory and /sys/bus/pci/slots/
Some slots and pcie port devices should be there now.

/sys/bus/pci_express/devices:
total 0

/sys/bus/pci_express/drivers:
total 0
drwxr-xr-x 2 root root 0 Jan 27 13:17 pciehp/
