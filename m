For that use-case, though, alignment alone doesn't necessarily help -
you need the whole allocation granularity to match your block size (i.e.
given a 1MB block size, asking for 17KB and getting back 17KB starting
at a 1MB boundary doesn't help much - that whole 1MB needs to be
allocated and everyone needs to know it to ensure that the whole lot can
be mapped safely). Now, whether it's down to the callers or the heap
implementations to decide and enforce that granularity is another
question, but provided allocations are at least naturally aligned to
whatever the granularity is (which is a reasonable assumption to bake
in) then it's all good.
