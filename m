Here are other apparent instances with bttv:

BTW, I did notice that
drivers/acpi/acpica/utglobal.c:acpi_ut_get_node_name() has a
return("####"); statement in it explicitly.  0x23232323 is "####" in
ASCII.  It could possibly be the case that anything that calls that
function could be a source of those "####" bytes.  Although the initial
patch submission comments make that seem unlikely.

Andy
