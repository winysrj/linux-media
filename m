Not as far as I am aware. I have 2 64-bit systems with DVB-T cards =

running openSUSE 11.0 Beta3plus x86_64 and results are the same as when =

the cards were used with the older 32-bit hardware and OS's in the same =

boxes. I swapped out the Motherboard/CPU/mem and used all the other =

components, installed 64-bit and carried on as normal.

Sid.
