I fail to see where do you need to duplicate dvb-core. An userspace
LD_PRELOAD handler that would do:

int socket;

int dvb_ioctl(int fd, unsigned long int request, ...)
{
         void *arg;
         va_list ap;
  
         va_start(ap, request);
         arg = va_arg(ap, void *);
         va_end(ap);

	send_net_ioctl_packet(socket, request, arg);
}

Is probably all you need to send _any_ ioctl's to a remote machine
(plus client's machine that would decode the ioctl packet and send
the ioctl to the actual driver).

Of course, you'll need hooks for all syscalls used (likely open, close,
ioctl, read, poll).

So, there's not much duplication, even if, for whatever reason, you
might need to hook some specific ioctls in order to optimize the
network performance.

To answer your question: your driver were nacked because of several reasons:
it is not a driver for an unsupported hardware, you failed to convince people
why this can't be implemented on userspace, the driver adds hooks at kernelspace
that would open internal API's that several developers don't agree on exposing
at userspace, as would allow non GPL license compatible drivers to re-use
their work in a way they are against.

You're free to politely argue with regards to your solution at the ML.

 From my side, due to already explained technical reasons, I nack the
current approach. I'm free to not comment it further, while there's
no new fact that would convince me otherwise.

Mauro
