Hi Mauro,

I don't see this patch on it's way upstream:

https://patchwork.kernel.org/patch/376612/   (Sent on 5 Dec 2010)
http://www.spinics.net/lists/linux-media/msg26649.html (Resent on 19 Dec 2010)

It fixes a regression in IR and Analog video for cx23885 based cards and
an intermittent analog video regression in ivtv based cards in 2.6.36
and soon in 2.6.37.

I don't see it in the media_tree staging/for_v2.6.38 nor
staging/for_2.6.37-rc1 nor master:
http://git.linuxtv.org/media_tree.git?a=history;f=drivers/media/video/cx25840/cx25840-core.c;h=dfb198d0415bc200b0152c1be105d722261653c5;hb=staging/for_v2.6.38
http://git.linuxtv.org/media_tree.git?a=history;f=drivers/media/video/cx25840/cx25840-core.c;h=dfb198d0415bc200b0152c1be105d722261653c5;hb=master
http://git.linuxtv.org/media_tree.git?a=history;f=drivers/media/video/cx25840/cx25840-core.c;h=dfb198d0415bc200b0152c1be105d722261653c5;hb=staging/for_v2.6.37-rc1

I don't see it at a very recent linux-next:
http://git.kernel.org/?p=linux/kernel/git/next/linux-next.git;a=history;f=drivers/media/video/cx25840/cx25840-core.c;h=dfb198d0415bc200b0152c1be105d722261653c5;hb=bfa221f25c0ec816f725c3a145bda4ee65a277ff

I don't see it at your kernel.org linux-next tree:
http://git.kernel.org/?p=linux/kernel/git/mchehab/linux-next.git;a=history;f=drivers/media/video/cx25840/cx25840-core.c;h=dfb198d0415bc200b0152c1be105d722261653c5;hb=refs/heads/master

Am I missing something?

I cannot get this *REGRESSION*, which I did not introduce, fixed in
stable tree(s) until it is upstream.


Also this following commit causes a very bad analog audio *REGRESSION*,
which is now shipping in major distirbutions:

http://git.kernel.org/?p=linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux-2.6.git;a=commitdiff;h=fcb9757333df37cf4a7feccef7ef6f5300643864
 
I emailed the LMML, you, and the author, as soon as I verified the root
cause on 31 Dec, and haven't heard from from anyone:

http://www.spinics.net/lists/linux-media/msg27261.html 

Please revert it before the merge window closes.

<rant>
I have no time to make improvements that I want to make, much less waste
my *VOLUNTEER* time on *REGRESSIONS* that *I DID NOT INTRODUCE*.

It bothers me enough, that as a volunteer, I have to clean up other
people's untested cr*pware.  AND, that as the lucky individual who finds
the bugs, I have to do additional work to get fixes back into stable
kernels.

Watching my requests for regressions to be fixed be ignored, as merge
windows go by without the fixes going forward so that even more users
and kernel versions are affected, makes me wonder why I do this anymore.

Anyone want to be ivtv and cx18 maintainer?

I do not share your optimism.  Regressions that affect the analog video
capture, for the userbase I deal with, have been introduced due to lack
of review and testing.  It appears to me, that these regessions are
going to be in yet another kernel version, 2.6.37, and the gates for
getting the known fixes back into stable kernels will still be left
unsatisfied.

I, nor PVR-150 and HVR-1250 users, have much to cheer about.

Andy
