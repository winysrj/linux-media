Hi Summit,

Sorry for the late review. I know that this code is now in mainline, but I 
still have a couple of comments. I'll send patches if you agree with them.

dmabuf->ops will never but NULL, but (see below)

you still check dmabuf->ops here, as well as in several places below. 
Shouldn't these checks be removed ?

What about returning ERR_PTR(-ENOMEM) directly here ?

These two lines can be moved before mutex_lock().
