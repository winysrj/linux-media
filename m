Guys

The TBS 6920 PCI-e card is in the Wiki and is a supported card.

The TBS 6980 dual tuner PCI-e card is not in the Wiki at all, is there
a reason for this given they have released a non GPL blob at least?

Also is there a reason that an indicative price for supported cards is
not shown in the wiki?  It would save a load of time rather then
having to search on each card only to find out it's ridiculously
priced at $1000.

Thanks
