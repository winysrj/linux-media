Greetings ...

 A little off topic, but I'm hoping you will forgive me and help with a bit
of direction ...

 Have a friend with a shop that wants to do advertising using TV sets.  Now
he already as network points through out the shop and I was thinking we
could put up a network to TV adapter to stream video over the network to the
TV's ... Great idea, but I can't seem to find anything like this with google
... Thinking I might be using the wrong search terms " network video stream
to TV RCA S-Video"...  Can find plenty of things about streaming to PC and
so on, but that's not what I'm looking for ...

 Does anybody have any ideas?

Thanks
Mailed
LeeT
