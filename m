AF903x series are not directly supported by V4L.

it913x-fe driver is loosely based on the AF903x frontend. In its private
header are some af9035 references.

At some point af903x may be spun out of the it913x-fe driver.

However, these devices use one or two controllers in a number of
different interfacing combinations.
