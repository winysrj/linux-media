  as my first foray into video, i'd like to set up my new hauppauge
wintv-hvr 950 tv tuner to watch OTA analog TV on my fedora 8 system.
i've poked around but haven't found a working recipe for this.  and
i'd rather not go the full mythtv route since i want to start simple
and build from there.

  at the moment, i have a fully-updated f8 system and, on the
recommendation of a friend, have installed xawtv as the viewing app.
so ... where from here?  i can certainly build a new kernel based on
the latest git repository but, as i read it, that won't give me the
module i want.

  in any event, what's next?  and other recommendations for a viewing
client?  i'm not trying to get overly fancy, i just want to get this
first step done, then i can take it from there.  thanks.
