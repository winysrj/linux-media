In the former case no, there is no VMA directly but if you want one than
a device can provide one. But such VMA is useless as CPU access is not
expected.

And that's what i am trying to get accross. There is 2 cases here.
What exist on today hardware. Thing like GPU direct, that works on
VMA level. Versus where some new hardware is going were want to do
thing on page level. Both require different API at different level.

What i was trying to get accross is that no matter what level you
consider in the end you still need something at the DMA API level.
And that the 2 different use case (device vma or regular vma) means
2 differents API for the device driver.

No ODP on those. If you want vma, the GPU device driver can provide
one. GPU object are disjoint from regular memory (coming from some
form of mmap). They are created through ioctl and in many case are
never expose to the CPU. They only exist inside the GPU driver realm.

None the less there is usecase where exchanging those object accross
computer over a network make sense. I am not an end user here :)

Personnaly i don't care too much about this old hardware and thus i am
fine without supporting them. The open source userspace is playing
catchup and doing feature for old hardware probably does not make sense.
