As expected, the card didn't work in Windows with either of those driver 
versions.  However, hauppauge.com has different drivers to 
hauppauge.co.uk!  The latest HVR2250 drivers from hauppauge.com, version 
7.6.27.27323, include 8940 in the inf file.  This version installs fine 
on Windows.

Frank.
