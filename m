At first, I was always using

mplayer tv:// -tv device=/dev/video1:input=1:norm=NTSC

which defaults to a resolution of 640x480. This output looked correct 
(except for vertical stripes) in kernel 2.6.32-23-generic, but was 
horizontally shifted after I updated to the current mercurial sources.

Then I noticed that

mplayer tv:// -tv device=/dev/video1:input=1:norm=NTSC:width=720

gives a correct picture with current hg source.

Ah, so those statistics are generated by mplayer, then, not by v4l.

I guess I'm just trying to confirm that v4l doesn't try to enforce a 
strict NTSC framerate, but just passes all frames on even if they appear 
at a slightly different framerate.
