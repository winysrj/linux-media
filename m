Hm...need to check hard coded MAX_ORDER usages...I don't think
side-effect is big. Hmm. But I think enlarging MAX_ORDER isn't an
important thing. A code which strips contiguous chunks of pages from
buddy allocator is a necessaty thing, as..

What I can think of at 1st is...
==
	int steal_pages(unsigned long start_pfn, unsigned long end_pfn)
	{
		/* Be careful mutal execution with memory hotplug, because reusing code */

		split [start_pfn, end_pfn) to pageblock_order
		
		for each pageblock in the range {
			Mark this block as MIGRATE_ISOLATE
			try-to-free pages in the range or
			migrate pages in the range to somewhere.
			/* Here all pages in the range are on buddy allocator
			and free and never be allocated by anyone else. */
		}

		please see __rmqueue_fallback(). it selects migration-type at 1st.
		Then, if you can pass start_migratetype of MIGLATE_ISOLATE,
		you can automatically strip all MIGRATE_ISOLATE pages from free_area[].

		return chunk of pages.
	}
==
