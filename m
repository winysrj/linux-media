The interface was written to mimic what OF does with clock.

Yeah, I agree that this sucks for non OF drivers.

Probably because they weren't converted yet to the new way.

Again, this is due to OF/DT. Open Firmware/Device Tree wants to have a
flexible, OS-independent way to specify clock sources, device parameters,
etc.

There are some docs describing DT somewhere at Documentation.
Maybe Documentation/video4linux/v4l2-framework.txt? 

Perhaps it is incomplete.

Well, async subdev only makes sense for Device Tree.

A synchronous init works a way better, as everything initializes at the 
same order, every time. Allowing subdevs to initialize on a random order is
a mess, and should be avoided if possible, as we have already enough
complexity to handle. Let's not introduce more if not needed.

It seems fine to only use the a new "dont_use_clk_api" flag on synchronous
init.
