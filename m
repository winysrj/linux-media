Subject: [ANNOUNCE] backports-3.14-1 released

Linux backports [0] backports-v3.14-1 is out [1]. Thanks for Hauke
for taking the torch while I was in limbo. The release obviously
has all the things that upstream has so there's no point in mentioning
any of that, but new drivers are igb, added by Stefan. This release
also has a new backports-update-manager under devel/ which will do
what you expect -- download any new kernels / keep trees in sycn and
remove any stale once we stop supporting them. One of the biggest changes
here is also the more extensive use of Coccinelle SmPL grammar [2] to
help further with automatic backports. I've written a piece of great
lengh to get people excited about the potential here. Hopefully, more
than anything, you'll just see by example how we do things better with
SmPL.
