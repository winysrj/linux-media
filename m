I perfectly looked at your example and I use it now in my system.

You did not see what could be done with your component code. For
example, since november, I have not yet the clock probe_defer in the
mainline (http://www.spinics.net/lists/arm-kernel/msg306072.html), so,
there are 3 solutions:

- hope the patch will be some day in the mainline and, today, reboot
  when the system does not start correctly,

- insert a delay in the tda998x and kirkwood probe sequences (delay
  long enough to be sure the si5351 is started, or loop),

- use your component work.

In the last case, it is easy:

- the si5351 driver calls component_add (with empty ops: it has no
  interest in the bind/unbind functions) when it is fully started (i.e.
  registered - that was the subject of my patch),

- in the DRM driver, look for the si5351 as a clock in the DT (drm ->
  encoder -> clock), and add it to the awaited components (CRTCs,
  encoders..),

- in the audio subsystem, look for the si5351 as an external clock in
  the DT (simple-card -> CPU DAI -> clock) and add it to the awaited
  components (CPU and CODEC DAIs - yes, the S/PDIF CODEC should also be
  a component with no bin/unbind ops).

Then, when the si5351 is registered, both master components video and
audio can safely run.
