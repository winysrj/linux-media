I agree with Pavel, this patch which fixing buffer overflow bug=20
should have been already included in kernel tree. And I think it=20
really does not matter which from, to or cc lines are specified=20
for singleline patch which was inspirated by static code checker.=20
Rather to have fixed bug as talking who found it or who fixed it.
