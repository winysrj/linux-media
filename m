There is only very rare case where the i830 driver might get used with
SMP and really I think that case is in the don't care place, since if
you have that hw you probably should be using i915 on it anyways.

So it really only leaves the problem case of what do distros do if we
mark things as BROKEN_ON_SMP, since no distro builds UP kernels and
when you boot the SMP kernels on UP they don't run as SMP so not
having the driver load on those is a problem. Maybe we just need some
sort of warn on smp if a smp unfriendly driver is loaded and we
transition to SMP mode. Though this sounds like either (a) something
we do now and I don't about it, (b) work.
