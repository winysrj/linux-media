I've been hardly trying to attend the conference but I'm afraid not
gonna make it.
But going to try to arrange the characteristics of the H/W I'm working
on in a brief document and also expected new V4P2 APIs. I'll let you
know when I finish my documentation.
I know this is a good chance to discuss about where the video4linux
for SoC platforms to go and I'm desperately looking forward to
participate. but my business trip depends on the approval of my boss.
Thus I'm very disappointed that I can't make it.
Cheers,

Nate
