Hello, Shuah.

Can you tell me the difference between the following two?

my_trylock1() {
	if (!mutex_trylock(my_lock->lock))
		return -EBUSY;
	was_busy = my_lock->busy;
	my_lock->busy = true;
	mutex_unlock(my_lock->lock);
	return was_busy ? -EBUSY : 0;
}

my_trylock2() {
	mutex_lock();
	was_busy = my_lock->busy;
	my_lock->busy = true;
	mutex_unlock(my_lock->lock);
	return was_busy ? -EBUSY : 0;
}

Now, because the only operation you support is trylock and unlock,
neither will malfunction (as contention on the inner lock can only
happen iff there's another lock holder).  That said, the code doesn't
make any sense.

Here's the problem.  I really don't feel comfortable acking the
submitted code which implements a locking primitive when the primary
author who would probably be the primary caretaker of the code for the
time being doesn't really seem to understand basics of
synchronization.

I'm sure that this could just be from lack of experience but at least
for now I really think this should at least be gated through someone
else who's more knowledgeable and I defintely don't think I'm setting
the bar too high here.

As such, please consider the patches nacked and try to find someone
who can shepherd the code.  Mauro, can you help out here?

Thanks.
