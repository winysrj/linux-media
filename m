Hi all,

It's time to start nailing down the agenda for the Graphics and Display 
microconference at the Linux Plumbers Conference 2013. For conference approval 
and preliminary planning purposes, we have compiled a list of possible topics 
for discussion. The overview and general list of topic ideas is available 
here:

http://wiki.linuxplumbersconf.org/2013:graphics_and_display

The final topics for the microconference need to be formally proposed and 
accepted. We would like to focus on topics which would benefit from discussion 
to determine project/feature direction, rather than those which are well 
defined and looking for a likely person to do an implementation. Instructions 
for how to formally submit a presentation are available here:

http://www.linuxplumbersconf.org/2013/submitting-microconference-discussion-topics/

Please feel free to update the wiki if there are topic ideas you think we have 
overlooked, and feel free to start a thread in response to this message if you 
want a more public forum for validating your topic idea; of course, you should 
also be submitting your ideas formally :-). We are also thinking that there 
may be some topics that could cross over with the Android microconference 
(leads on cc).

For key attendees who think they will need travel assistance to attend, the 
deadline is July 18th, the budget is very limited, and the requests need to go 
through the conference committee.

If you have any questions or concerns about the microconference, please feel 
free to contact us. Looking forward to seeing everyone in New Orleans.
