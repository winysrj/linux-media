Hello Sven,

I am trying to write a driver for SI2165 to get my WinTV-HVR 930C-HD
running.
What device do you have?

I posted my current version here:
http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.linux.drivers.video-input-infrastructure/71692

Getting tests and or i2c dumps would be really cool.

Regards
Matthias
