Hello Bruce,

Questions like this are much better directed to the linux-media
mailing list rather than to me personally.  As a developer, if I
answered every email from every new user who can't figure out how to
make their card work then I would never get any code written.

The linuxtv.org wiki is also a good resource for debugging.

Adding the mailing list to the cc:.  Somebody should be able to walk
you through the introductory steps for debugging basic end-user
issues.

Devin
