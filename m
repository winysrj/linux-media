I am not an expert on these chips and, unfortunately, never had anyone
from SiLabs  to talk to all the time I worked on this driver. But from
my understanding from working with the chip/reading of the datasheet,
when working in diversity mode two chips are connected to two
different antennas and interconnected between each other so that
secondary tuner can pass semi-processed signal to the primary one. So
to the best of my understanding those sttings cause the following mode
of operation:

* Disabled -- no link is established, tuner acts no differently than
if other tuner didn't exist.
* Primary combinig -- link is established, tuner is configured to be a
primary tuner using signal from both itself and a secondary one
* Primary antenna -- link is established, tuner is configured to be a
primary tuner using signal from its own antenna
* Secondary antenna -- link is established, tuner is configured to be
a primary tuner using signal from secondary tuner's antenna
* Secondary -- link is established, tuner is configured to be a
secondary tuner feeding the signal from its antenna to the primary one

It seems that "Disabled" setting is the setting one would want to use
if the chip is used in a non diversity-mode enabled system.
