That's what I meant, yes. And I'm glad that we finally agree on something, 
even if it's a detail :-)

I'm fine with that, as that's what the ports node has been originally designed 
for.

The OF graph bindings documentation could just specify the ports node as 
optional and mandate individual device bindings to specify it as mandatory or 
forbidden (possibly with a default behaviour to avoid making all device 
bindings too verbose).
