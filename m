So... to summarise, the sensor determines the flash power by providing
the flash controller a pwm signal both in flash and torch modes, if I
understand correctly?

This sounds like a quite low level control. Is the flash controller
still an I2C device?

I've never tried it out with Ubuntu. Probably that 128 MiB of RAM is
slightly small for Ubuntu. ;-)
