Well, we can add a Glossary at the spec, but this is a huge work,
as we'll need to seek for other terms and to adjust all references
to use the Glossary wording. This is a separate work than what this
patch proposes to solve.

Yet, I agree that ambiguity should be solved. I believe that the
second version of this patch series address it.

Yes. IMO, we should use:

- "device node" when it may refer to any device node,
  including mc and subdev;
- "V4L2 device node" when it refers only to the devices that are now 
  described at the "V4L2 Device Node Naming" section (see patch 1 of the
  new patch series).

Yes. Let's leave it out.

as proposed by Hans, on the newer version, we're just using "hardware".

I don't see the need of using those "peripheral" wording terms in this chapter.
Let's leave it out for now.

No, but it helps to identify when drivers became incompatible with
generic apps. We could, instead point on what Kernel version it
happened. That probably makes more sense and will match the history
part of the spec.

The history is important for app developers, as they need to know
what Kernel versions are affected by V4L2 device nodes that look
like vdev-centric ones but aren't.

Yet, you're right on one point: the date doesn't matter, but, instead,
the Kernel version where the first mc-centric driver were added.

Done at version 2, already submitted.

There are already such devices, as discussed at #media-maint ML. We're
just documenting the existing status.

What we can do is to add a notice that this is not recommended or
that people should not add it without a discussion about what that
is needed.
