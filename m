 Anton,

Thankyou for cleaning this code up (and you as well Steven).

I have been meaning to do some more work on this lately, but you have
taken it to were I was hoping to go.

Steven, I can test your cleaned up code as well, just drop me an email
and I will run it on my machines (I have several that I have access to
with these cards in them, with various other cards).

Regards,

Stephen.

<br>
Great!<br>
