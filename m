Umm... flushing a freed work item doesn't make any sense at all.  The
pointer itself loses the ability to identify anything.  What if it
gets recycled to another work item which happens to depend on the
flusher to make forward progress?  You now have a circular dependency
through a recycled memory area.  Good luck hunting that down.

For pretty much any API, allowing dangling pointers as argument is
insane.  If you want to flush self-freeing work items, flush the
kthread_worker.  That's how it is with workqueue and how it should be
with kthread_worker too.

Thanks.
