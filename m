Hi,

Does anyone have experience of using the Hauppuage Nova-T 500 with DVB-T 
broadcasts with h.264 and AAC audio?

DTT in New Zealand uses these formats and I'm seeing poor performance 
from the Nova-T card. My thinking is that it was probably not conceived 
for dealing with dual h264 streams.

Has the PCIe HVR-2200 been tested with dual h.264? I was wondering if 
this card might have better performance.

Thanks,

Lou
