Subject: [PATCH 0/2] media: davinci: vpif: capture/display support for async subdevice probing

This patch series adds support for vpif capture and display
driver to support asynchronously register subdevices.

Need for this support:
Currently bridge device drivers register devices for all subdevices
synchronously, typically, during their probing. E.g. if an I2C CMOS sensor
is attached to a video bridge device, the bridge driver will create an I2C
device and wait for the respective I2C driver to probe. This makes linking
of devices straight forward, but this approach cannot be used with
intrinsically asynchronous and unordered device registration systems like
the Flattened Device Tree.

This is the NON RFC version, following are previous RFC versions,
RFC V1: http://us.generation-nt.com/answer/patch-rfc-0-3-vpif-capture-support-async-subdevice-probing-help-210037922.html
RFC V2: https://lkml.org/lkml/2013/4/22/159
RFC V3: http://lkml.indiana.edu/hypermail/linux/kernel/1305.1/03180.html
