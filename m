Good catch!

Unfortunately, not all gcc versions complain about the lack of the __udivi32
library. Some (like the one I run on my desktop), will add some inlined
assembler code for it, instead of requiring some library to do the division.

We'll likely only discover such bugs only after sending the code to linux-next
(done later yesterday - but I suspect that it were pulled only today from
my tree) and receiving a complain for the ones that run those robots that
test hundreds of different CONFIG_foo options.

So, I suspect that we'll have some of such complaints by tomorrow...
