Additional to that we need allot of special handling in case of a hardware lockup here, which isn't done if you abuse the fence interface like this.

Please don't modify the fence interface at all and instead use the wait functions already exposed by radeon_fence.c. If you need some kind of signaling mechanism then wait inside a workqueue instead.

Sure it does if hardware synchronization isn't supported.

Yeah, that's the same concept we used to have for multiple rings, to 
avoid stalling if a buffer is currently used in a different part of the 
GPU than the current command submission wants it to. After allot of 
internal discussion we came to the conclusion that it just doesn't worth 
the effort.

Have you thought over all the consequences that are implied by having a 
serialized stream of command submissions?

When a buffer is in use by another device you basically have only two 
options: Either block for the buffer to become unused or use a hardware 
method (semaphores) to sync up your operations. Of course you can 
optimize by using a multiple reader / single writers model, but for this 
you basically just have to teach ttm that there might be more than one 
fence for each bo.

Anyway those things are only optimizations, and in the end it always 
comes down to blocking the command submission if there is no other way 
of hardware synchronization and I absolutely don't see any reason why we 
shouldn't do this with just a normal blocking call to a waitqueue.

Christian.
