We did the tests with real multimedia drivers - video codec and video
converter (s5p-mfc and s5p-fimc). These drivers allocate large contiguous 
buffers for video data. The allocation is performed when driver is opened
by user space application. 

First we consumed system memory by running a set of simple applications
that just did some malloc() and filled memory with random pattern to consume
free pages. Then some of that memory has been freed and we ran the video
decoding application. Multimedia drivers successfully managed to allocate
required contiguous buffers from MIGRATE_CMA ranges.

The tests have been performed with different system usage patterns (malloc(),
heavy filesystem load, anonymous memory mapping). In all these cases CMA
worked surprisingly good allowing the drivers to allocate the required 
contiguous buffers.
