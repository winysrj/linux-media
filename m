Hi,

I recently bought a Hauppauge WinTV-HVR-900H (usb id: 2040:b138), but I 
see from this wiki page 
http://linuxtv.org/wiki/index.php/Hauppauge_WinTV-HVR-900H that there is 
no driver for it. However that's as of 2008.

Has there been any progress on this since? Is that wiki page correct 
that there is still no support for that card? Is there anyway to get 
this USB device to work under linux?

Thanks,
