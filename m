As we did in 2012, we're planning to do a media summit again at KS/2012.

The KS/2012 will happen in San Diego, CA, US, between Aug 26-28, just
before the LinuxCon North America.

In order to do it, I'd like to know who is interested on participate,
and to get proposals about what subjects will be discussed there,
in order to start planning the agenda.

Thanks!
Mauro

OK, so far I believe I've heard concrete suggestions from identified
(or fairly well identified :-) stuckees willing to organize
mini-summits for:

* ARM
* Media
* PCI
* memcg

I may have missed some, so if people could send a message to the
discuss list with [MINI-SUMMIT] in the subbject line and the name of
the proposed mini-summit, that would be really helpful.  Please
indicate whether you are volunteering to help organize the proposed
mini-summit, or identify someone you think can be volunteered.  :-)

Things that we will be asking the mini-summit chars to determine, in
addition to who should be given invites for Tuesday and Wednesday is
an estimate of how much time you need, and a list of sub-topics (and
who might lead the sub-topic discussion).  We will be asking you to
create a fairly well-defined schedule, with 30 and 60 minute slots, so
that we can publish a schedule and so that people who might need to
hop between mini-summits, have a chance to do so.  So please start
thinking about how long each of your sub-topics will need to be, and
who might be needed for a particular sub-topic's discussion to be
successful.  There may be a number of developers, with fingers in
multiple subsystem, where scheduling may become a bit of a challenge.

Thanks!!
