I will be here to discuss the request API:

Topic: request/jobs API
Purpose: overview of the work based on the request API (proposed new
name: jobs API), to hopefully converge to something that can be merged
soon.

I plan to have a concrete, reasonable proposal by then.

Pawel may also attend, but not 100% sure yet.

Looking forward to seeing you all there!

Alex.
