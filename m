If you've ever used an ARM system with a VIVT cache, you'll know what's
wrong with this approach.

ARM systems with VIVT caches have extremely poor task switching
performance because they flush the entire data cache at every task switch
- to the extent that it makes system performance drop dramatically when
they become loaded.

Doing that for every DMA operation will kill the advantage we've gained
from having VIPT caches and ASIDs stone dead.
