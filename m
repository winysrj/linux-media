Oh, interesting...

This is definitely an interesting proposal, something to think about ...

I have 2 concerns wrt this approach:

1) It feels less clean then just having a single driver; and
2) I agree it will be less coding, but I doubt it will really be that much
less work. It will likely need less new code (but a lot can be more or
less copy pasted), but it will need changes across a wider array of
subsystems / userspace components, requiring a lot of coordinating,
getting patches merged in different projects, etc. So in the end I
think it too will be quite a bit of work.

I guess that what I'm trying to say here is, that if we are going to
spend a significant amount of time on this, we might just as well
go for the best solution we can come up with even if that is some
more work.

Regards,

Hans
