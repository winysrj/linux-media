Hi,

I am planning to work on getting the H3A support (Auto White balance,
Auto Exposure and Auto Focus Support) for OMAP4 ISS.

I wanted to check if anyone is working to get this module working.

Is OMAP3 H3A similar or same as OMAP4 H3A. Can i make use of the OMAP3
code base for h3a or how complex is this activity?

Also, i wanted to how how to test the v4l resizer driver in omap4iss?

Any help is highly appreciated.
