OK. You and Daniel have convinced me to leave OOM- and fragmentation 
handling
out of TTM, but I still think TTM DMA placement might be a good thing to 
look at
when time allows.

I agree it would be possible and desirable to do that for the movable 
pages backing bo data,
however for non-movable data structures (buffer object metadata, fence 
objects) etc.
there still needs to be a way to avoid exhausting kmalloced memory.

agreed.
