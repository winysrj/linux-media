This warning line:

warning: (VIDEO_CAFE_CCIC && MEDIA_SUPPORT && VIDEO_CAPTURE_DRIVERS && PCI && I2C && VIDEO_V4L2 || VIDEO_VIA_CAMERA && MEDIA_SUPPORT && VIDEO_CAPTURE_DRIVERS && VIDEO_V4L2 && FB_VIA) selects VIDEO_OV7670 which has unmet direct dependencies (MEDIA_SUPPORT && VIDEO_CAPTURE_DRIVERS && !VIDEO_HELPER_CHIPS_AUTO && I2C && VIDEO_V4L2)

is not caused by CAFE_CCIC -- it's caused by VIDEO_VIA_CAMERA, because
VIDEO_HELPER_CHIPS_AUTO=y, so !VIDEO_HELPER_CHIPS_AUTO is false, so
VIDEO_OV7670 should not be available since it depends on
!VIDEO_HELPER_CHIPS_AUTO.

Below is a simple patch that reduces the kconfig warning count in 2.6.37-rc1
from 240 down to only 88.  :)

That does not change any kconfig symbol logic/truth values.

Clean up some video driver dependencies.
Reduces the kconfig warning for unmet dependencies from 240
down to only 88 in 2.6.37-rc1.

This makes the drivers in the VIDEO_HELPER_CHIPS_AUTO menu not
be dependent on that symbol.  Just splash a comment there
instead.  config tools will display the comment when
VIDEO_HELPER_CHIPS_AUTO is false.
