I recently came across this interesting little USB device which seems 
the so far best bet on covering all the relevant standards for these 
parts of the woods (although it still misses out on DVB-T2 support). 
However, I have so far been unable to determine whether any level of 
linux support exists (and therefore whether it's useful or not). Anybody 
know if drivers exist?

BR

Erik.
