Yes, but this way implies using a feed reader or similar. I'm aware of
this way, but this would mean unsubscribing from the list to stop
receiving the mails and just read them through an external program /
webpage. What also means that, if I want to post a new message or just
answering one I'd need to re-subscribe again just for doing so.

I really preferred the other way (it's what I also use for other mail
lists such as mythtv-users and mythtv-dev), and I found it very
convenient...

Regards
  Eduard
