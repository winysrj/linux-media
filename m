Just to make sure we're on the same page (and that I'm parsing
correctly): Are you saying the individual 'port' nodes should be
required? Or that the container 'ports' node should always be required?

If you're saying that the individual port nodes should be required, then
yes I agree. I'm still a little uncomfortable about there being a choice
between the link directly in the port node or in a child endpoint node,
but I'll compromise on this if we put sanity checking into the API (as I
replied on the other thread).

Whether or not a container 'ports' node is present I think should be
defined by the device binding. It really comes down to organization of
data. If the device is sufficiently complex that it makes sense to group
the ports together (say, because the device has other children with a
different purpose), then 'ports' makes absolute sense.
