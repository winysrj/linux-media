Hi Krzysztof,

I've CC-ed Ismael, the solo maintainer.

The big picture behind all the changes is a push to get this driver out of
staging. It turned out that the driver in the kernel had diverged substantially
from the driver maintainer internally by bluecherry, and the work I did
merged those two forks as best as I could, cleaned up the code and ensured that
all the latest internal frameworks were used.

The only thing preventing the driver from being moved out of staging is the
motion detection functionality. I've been working on that, but it didn't
make 3.12.

The problem was that the bluecherry driver had many changes as well in the
same area, and that I could not test it on a big endian system.

I hadn't realized the problems this would cause on big endian systems, if I
had I would have attempted to merge your changes.

I took the latest bluecherry code as the basis for the changes, merging what
I could from the kernel code. Unfortunately this was very hard to do backport,
so I decided to take bluecherry's code.

Two reasons: first of all this is the convention within drivers/media,
secondly the backwards compatibility build system that allows people to
compile the latest media code for older kernels requires unique filenames.

See http://git.linuxtv.org/media_build.git and here:

It's a staging driver, so by definition unstable. That said, I do apologize
for missing the big-endian problems.

That sounds reasonable. Please post it to the mailinglist so it can be
reviewed by Ismael and I'd be happy to take it in.
