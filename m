Let's try slowly again:

1. The current mainline driver doesn't work for you, right? What exactly 
is failing and how? What fourcc format?

2. Do you think, it would be possible to fix the driver to also support 
your use-case with the present generic / pass-through mode? Have you tried 
this? Could you try? That would be a bug-fix.

3. After the first two questions are answered, then we can think about 
extending the driver by adding native support forvarious specific formats.
