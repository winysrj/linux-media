Hi,

Sorry to be late. In this weekday, I have little time for this thread
because working for alsa-lib[1]. Besides, I'm not full-time developer
for this kind of work. In short, I use my limited private time for this
discussion.

In this morning, I read IEEE 1722:2011 and realized that it quite
roughly refers to IEC 61883-1/6 and includes much ambiguities to end
applications.

(In my opinion, the author just focuses on packet with timestamps,
without enough considering about how to implement endpoint applications
which perform semi-real sampling, fetching and queueing and so on, so as
you. They're satisfied just by handling packet with timestamp, without
enough consideration about actual hardware/software applications.)

Depends on which subsystem decides "AVTP presentation time"[3]. This
value is dominant to the number of events included in an IEC 61883-1
packet. If this TSN subsystem decides it, most of these items don't need
to be in ALSA.

As long as I know, the number of AVTPDU per second seems not to be
fixed. So each application is not allowed to calculate the timestamp by
its own way unless TSN implementation gives the information to each
applications.

For your information, in current ALSA implementation of IEC 61883-1/6 on
IEEE 1394 bus, the presentation timestamp is decided in ALSA side. The
number of isochronous packet transmitted per second is fixed by 8,000 in
IEEE 1394, and the number of data blocks in an IEC 61883-1 packet is
deterministic according to 'sampling transfer frequency' in IEC 61883-6
and isochronous cycle count passed from Linux FireWire subsystem.

In the TSN subsystem, like FireWire subsystem, callback for filling
payload should have information of 'when the packet is scheduled to be
transmitted'. With the information, each application can calculate the
number of event in the packet and presentation timestamp. Of cource,
this timestamp should be handled as 'avtp_timestamp' in packet queueing.

In ALSA kernel/userspace interfaces , the specification cannot be
supported, at all.

Please explain about this requirement, where it comes from, which
specification and clause describe it (802.1AS or 802.1Q?). As long as I
read IEEE 1722, I cannot find such a requirement.

(When considering about actual hardware codecs, on-board serial bus such
as Inter-IC Sound, corresponding controller, immediate change of
sampling rate is something imaginary for semi-realtime applications. And
the idea has no meaning for typical playback/capture softwares.)
