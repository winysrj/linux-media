We all realize, that FPGA programming not belongs to DVB only, it is more common.
But my intention to write driver for DVB and V4L device... 
Yes, it needed for DVB device to work, and it works on real hardware.
FPGA model used in device has not flash memory. So every time the so-called "firmware" has to be 
loaded on early device initialization stage. Then FPGA itself drives CI and hardware PID filter. 
Fhysically, FPGA JTAG interface connected to cx23885 GPIO lines.

Take a look on  media/dvb/dvb-usb drivers. There is a lot of FX2 firmware dependant devices, but 
no one of them uses userspace utilities to push firmware inside.
If someone has something to put on table, I mean code implementation, then put it on.

Everithing is possible to change, but it is needed to begin with something.
