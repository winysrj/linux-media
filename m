Hello,

Le Wed, 21 Dec 2011 13:14:55 -0500,

Be careful, there are several devices that the commercial name
"EasyCAP" but that internally aren't the same thing. We had the
experience of a device labelled "EasyCAP", which was working fine with
the easycap driver in drivers/staging. We bought another one from
Amazon, also labeled EasyCAP, and even though it looked exactly the
same externally, the hardware inside is completely different and is not
supported by the easycap driver in drivers/staging.

Regards,

Thomas
