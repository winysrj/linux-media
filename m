Giving some random living room these days, likely open to the kids
rooms, you have to take that into account.

Another point, if decoding from IRQs generated by the remote, there is
flawed hardware around, needing to poll IRQs in some timely manner to
get it to something at all.

This will break such remotes. Never seen?

For me the first priority is, that existing remotes are not broken.

Don't tell you have done a nice job just now, but are unfortunately in
need of testers ...
