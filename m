I don't require V4L to implement anything.  You were the one wanting
AVB "devices".  Go ahead and do that, but in user space please.  We
don't want to have kernel code that sends arbitrary Layer2 and UDP
media packets.

The example you present of using aplay over the network is a cute
idea, but after all it is a trivial application.  I have nothing
against creating virtual ALSA devices (if done properly), but that
model won't work for more realistic AVB networks.

A raw socket is the way to do it, yes.

Since TSN is about bandwidth reservation and time triggered Ethernet,
decoupled from the contents of the streams, each new TSN application
will have to see what works best.  If common ground is found, then a
library makes sense to do.

At this point, it is way too early to guess how that will look.  But
media packet formats clearly belong in user space.

The layer should be in user space.  Alsa-lib *is* user space.

Thanks,
