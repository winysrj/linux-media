Hi,

I have recently purchased an Acer Aspire Revo RL70 HTPC which comes
with a built-in "AVerMedia A373 MiniCard Dual DVB-T" which uses two
ITE T913x tuners.  This card is currently unsupported in Linux and I
have documented some details on the wiki at
http://linuxtv.org/wiki/index.php/AVerMedia_A373_MiniCard_Dual_DVB-T .
 I have a photo that I can upload once approved, and I also have
Windows 7 installed on the machine so can provide details from there
if needed.  If anyone is interested in adding support I'd be happy to
help out where I can.

Cheers!

John.
