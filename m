Yes, waiting for info...

Currently I don't have time for developing this and I don't even want 
put my fingers to this soap if there is someone else working actively.

Looks like no firmware needed at all.

Works with mplayer. But radio didn't start to play for reason or other. 
Totem-xine plays also radio but sound cuts all the time. And now when 
switch channels it also hangs and stick should be re-plugged. Seems like 
many issues and that's why it is still in the development :)
