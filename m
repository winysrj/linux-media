Dear  Friend,

I am happy to inform you about my success in getting those funds
transferred under the cooperation of a new partner from paraguay.
Presently i'am in Paraguay for investment projects with my own share
of the total sum. meanwhile,I didn't forget your past efforts and
attempts to assist me in transferring those funds despite that it
failed us some how.

Now contact my secretary in Burkina-Faso her name is ms.Marria Philip on
her email address below.(marria_philip24@yahoo.fr)

Ask  her to send you the total cheque of $850.000.00 dollars which I
kept for your  compensation for all the past efforts and attempts to
assist me in this matter.  I appreciated your efforts at that time
very much. so feel free and get in touched with my secretary  and give
him the address where to send the cheque to you.

Please do let me know immediately you receive it so that we can share
the joy after all the stress at that time. In the moment, I’m very
busy here because of the investment projects which me and the new
partner are having at hand, finally, remember that I had forwarded
instruction to my secretary on your behalf to deliver that cheque to
you, so feel free to get in touch with my secretary ,by email  he will
send the amount to you without any delay.

Regards,
Mr.KARIUM AMADOU
